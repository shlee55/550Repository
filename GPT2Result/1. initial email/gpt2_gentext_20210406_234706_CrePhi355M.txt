Title: I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE
 I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE Dear Friend, How are you today? I found your contact through my International business directory, I am Michael Leo  a senior accountant with the  Hong Kong Solid Gold company Ltd. I am married with three kid’s and a quiet  person. I was advised to send you the news via my private  email, so i thought, why not give you this opportunity.   I am Mr Michael Leo  the Senior accountant with the Hong Kong Solid Gold company Ltd. I am  writing  this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business  transaction of this sort.   I discovered an unclaimed sum of 9.8 million , five hundred and  fourteen thousand  United state dollars . The said amount was kept in an account  belonging to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family  on the 8th of November 2005 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin  to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the money unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all  the information about the death including the report of the bank where the  money is deposited and the next of kin  was sent to me as  notification to withdraw this money or forfeith it.   My late client has an account is valued at 18 Million, us$18million  a year ago. We are not allowed to operate a foreign account  without prior approval of the bank where the money is  being kept and I personally will not be able to fully understand  this transaction if I don't have prior approval from  the bank for this transaction.   I am in possession of all necessary legal documents that will  enable me present you as the next of kin of the deceased on  successful claim of this money,   Note that when   a foreign account is used in this transaction the money is paid into  the account of the account holder of the account, i.e the account holder of  the account where the money is being kept.   This is because the bank has orders from the Hong Kong Monetary  Authority to close all  accounts belonging to dead   The deceased,  who does not have any next of kin or relation to the account holder,   Hence we are in need of a foreign account  where the money can be  be paid back without any  problem.    I suggest that you get to me immediately to give you more  details and  clearifications on how we can execute this transaction. Note that if  you are willing to assist us, endeavor to contact me  immediately so that we can formally agree and proceed with processing  this transaction.

Since I got your contact, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his  money because we cannot release it unless someoneapplied for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

ATTN: I am Mr thomson kabob, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South Africa Plc[East] Cape Town Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. John Huang made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, value  US$20,000,000.00(Twenty Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. John Huang died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John Huang did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the South Africa Law, at the expiration of  (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John Huang so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5%  for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction .There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Title:  RE:confidential and urgent business transaction/business proposal from Mr. Charles W. Smith. General Manager, Plantation and Mariana Island Solid Gold Corporation. I want to first introduce my self to you for our mutual business/personal benefit, but I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you with trust and confidence. I am Mr. Charles W. Smith, the General Manager Plantation and Mariana Island Solid Gold Corporation. Our client, Mr. Allan Wong, a foreigner, made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five hundred thousand United State Dollars only, in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war in countries like Syria and Iraq. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the funds had been dormant in his account for 4 years. After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Allan Wong did not declare any next of kin or relations in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five hundred thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Allan Wong so that you will be able to receive his fund.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Allan Wong, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate/Administration in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  SECURITY OF THE FUND:  We are going to invest the money in a lucrative business venture, so we will need your safekeeping for the investment. That is why I wanted you to send me your safe bank account for the fund and also provide me with your biometrics to enable the attorney will get to your data base.  I want us to transact this business in a legal manner, so the attorney will use all legal means to obtain the necessary approvals, to avoid violation of the law, please you should receive his urgent reply through the above email box,  Yours faithfully, Mr. Charles W. Smith

Title: Greetings
 Greetings Greetings Dear Sir/ Madam There is a foreign, an account opened in the bank in london in the year 2000, for the filing of claim,and account is owned by my late father. He entrusted the management of this account with my late father, to whom he gave away large sums of money. We used to live on this money as inheritance. My late father gave me this information about the account when he died. He deposited the sum of forty-eight million five hundred thousand united state bills in the account. I want to ask for your personal assistance to make this happen, if you can be helpful to me, for the benefit of all parties. I deposited this money in the account to avoid the account holder from knowing that we were on the process of claiming the money when they deposited the money. The management  agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as the account owner, and 70% for us. I want you to act as the account owner of the account so that the money will be legally claimable by you as the beneficiary of the money when it is actually deposited in the account. I have two options for you, firstly you can select from among the available bank account in the bank where you will transfer this money, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper sharing of the fund between us. Whichever the option you wish, feel free to forward to me your full name and address so that I can forward the contact of the bank where you wish the deposit made and also include your direct telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Please be informed that a very important person in the bank, who did not want to be named, gave me the commission papers from which you are getting this fund and instructed me to get in touch with you as soon as possible with instructions to come over to your country to start investing, soon as I get your positive response. Please always be very confident of your own abilities, whenever you get this fund I will send you the details of the account which you will use to nominate another bank account for this money to be deposited into. Best regards, Mrs. Maryam Abacha Reply To This Email: mariamabacha@yahoo.com

 From: Dr.L.M.Shongo The head of special operations section in the prime bank here in South Africa, I got your contact through my corporatist e-mail. I asked you to forward to me your private fax number for easy and urgent communication. On further investigation, I discovered that you were one of the victims of unspeakable crimes committed by the ungrateful Government of Nelson Mandela. Although his government has been unable to prevent the release of the fugitives, the owner of this account is Mr. Nkomo Advocu, a citizen of Angola, who ran afoul of the law by continuing to operate accounts after his safe custody expired. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that you were the victim of unspeakable crime, which should be subject to arrest and investigation immediately by the law enforcement agencies concerned. It is only a foreigner who can handle such a transaction and he has strongly advised that his account be booked immediately so as to avoid any breach of the law. I agree that our shares in the total sum of US$18,700,000.00 will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. Note that my share is US$50,000,000.00 and Ethil Shongo's is US$50,000,000.00; All necessary arrangement has been made for the transfer, all necessary documents have been made available to me and a decision taken to execute this agreement with you right away. So if you are willing and interested to assist, kindly get back to me by my e-mail box.Please be assured that I will be very grateful if you can come forward to make this claim. With my influence and the position of the bank director, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. Please, be rest assured that I will be expecting your urgent response and if you accept to help, I will furnish you with more details of this transaction. Please, note that the reserve bank here in South Africa does not issue foreign bank account for this type of transaction and this is the reason why you come to my country to set up a deposit for this money.  If you are interested, kindly get back to me by my e-mail: msmoso@mail2world.com  Would be grateful if you could give me your public phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Reply me through this two email addresses: msmoso@mail2world.com &lt;msmoso1@shakespeare.shbna.com&gt;,  &lt;msmoso2@shakespeare.shbna.com&gt; &gt; Reply me through this private email address: msmoso1@shakespeare.shbna.com  Best regards, Dr.L.M.Shongo

We are of Armenian extraction and my husband was born and raised in the city of Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory coast.  My husband was involved in a gold and diamond smuggling and arms trafficking business with the Abacha's in Ivory coast and had made a numbered fixed deposit in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan.  He died late last year of heart attack and since then nobody has come up to claim his money.  It was last year that my husband deposited the sum of US$48.500.000/fourty million United State Dollars only in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan, that he intended to use for the purchase of arms and ammunition with the help of some top officials from the government of abidjan.  Sadly, all the plan was for our sons divorce.  Now my husband was ready to submit his bank balance

Attn:I got your email address through internet when I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy individual for this important business trusting in your trust and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.      RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL: A British national, Mr. John McKee, an accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000, 000.00(Twenty-five million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On this deposit, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

This sum of USD$25,000, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

 BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Jacob N. Fosu, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$19,500,000.00(twenty five million dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Jacob Fosu died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jacob Fosu had actively opposed the government of ZIMBABWE, and was consequently murdered. It is therefore on this discovery that I now decided to write to you to seek your grateful assistance in transferring the money    to your account to  enable the fund to be put in your account for future use.                                                                                                     This amount $19,500,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is rolling   accruing. We want you to forward this money to your nominated bank account by fax or by email   so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We will employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and also to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you nominated bank account.                      You should also indicate your contact address and telephone number for easy communication.                          To enable the transfer to move very smoothly, you should also furnish us with your confidential telephone number for easy and safe communication.                          Please, remain patient and help us make this transfer a success.                             Thank you,   JIMBOFOLETTO

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY FROM MR AMIRI BIRRE. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I am MR AMIRI BIRRE, the man Gave you this contact. I got your contact from the internet while I was searching for a reliable person through internet who can assist me in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 20 billion US dollars (twenty-five billion USD) in an account that belongs to one of our bank foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (Mar. 15.2001) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after a period of (Ten)two years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 70% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund into you account, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your's faithfully, MR AMIRI BIRRE.

I am Dr.Jame Edward who works with the Zonguldinger family trust bank here in South Africa. I got your contact through one of their overseas branches. Upon further investigation, I must also inform you that I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in one of their branches , I found a sum of 17.500 million US dollars. The source of this money was a deceased customer of their bank who died in a plane crash and no next of Kin or relation of the deceased has been found hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. John Anderson a foreigner and a sailor. He died on the 23rd July 2000. and no next of kin or relation of the deceased has been found hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The nature of his death and no other person knows about this account and my investigation proved to me as well that he died without making a WILL. So the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. I got your contact through a family friend who works with the bank so I decided to seek for you out. On further investigation, I found out that he did not declare any next of kin or relation to any of his offshore clients in any of his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of 17.500 million US dollars is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Laws of South Africa, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. John Anderson so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$27.5 million will be released to you as the next of kin to the bank account. When this money gets to you, you will be entitled to 20% of the total amount, 70% will be for me and my partner, while 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred during the course of this operation. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm it over there in the Cayman Islands and then send the money to your bank account here in South Africa for onward disbursement according to the percentages indicated. To start the process of the transaction, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin to Mr. John Anderson so that the entire arrangement will start from the beginning. After you apply, I will send to you a text of application which you will send to the bank account of Mr. John Anderson which you will open in the bank. I will also issue you a letter of application which you will send to the bank which will open the bank account you will open in the bank. When you have received the texts of both applications, I will send to you both letters of application. I want to assure both of you that this transaction is 100% risk &amp; trouble free. I have pictures to prove it. I need your collaboration to see it through. Thanks for your anticipated co-operation. Best regards, Mr. Jame Edward.

Title: Urgent urgent response
 Urgent urgent response Dear Sir,  I have a confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nicaraguan National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 10,000,000,00 U.S.Dollars (ten million, six hundred thousand U.S. dollars) in my branch upon maturity.                       On the delivery of the date, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (the Nicaraguan National Petroleum Corporation)  that Mr. David Ameeraly died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of 10,000,000,00 U.S. dollar is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nicaraguan Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a person to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Inquire as much or as little as you want concerning this transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Yours is wm_guzma@mail2world.com

I am Mr. MUSA GARUBA, an executive Accountant with one of the leading  Bank in  our country. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant  account with a balance of Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars  (US$5,500,000.00) only in my branch.

I know this email will reach you as a surprise but I crave your indulgence and pray for your blessings.   I have a proposal for your indulgence and support. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Charles Omari made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$5,000,000.00(five hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity.

On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Richard Williams made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at (Twenty-six Million Three Hundred Thousand American Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Richard Williams died from an automobile crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of $26,300,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it according to Chinese law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

Title: From The Desk Of erick w man   I am Mr.erickwman@tiscali.co.uk &lt;erickwman@tiscali.co.uk &gt; Dear Sir, I am Mr.erickwman@tiscali.co.uk from the Talent / Media &gt; purchasing department in the  Bank of Africa (B.O.A)Ouagadougou Burkina faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that will be beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and procurement of the network  equipment that is to be installed on the-aircraft of our bank, we discovered a  floating contract invoice for the contract I-Team certified jobs. This contract was for the install/operate on new  DC-8 and DC-36 aircraft at King Abidjan International Airport, Benin-Cote D'Ivore. The installed aircraft is the Boeing 737. I have since we have it under our control. On completion of the installation, a new contract was awarded to a foreign  contractor to install/operate on the DC-8 and DC-36 aircraft. This contract was for the cost of the aircraft. This amount $18.8M was meant for the purchase of parts and the refurbishing of all the old aircraft parts. The old electrical and electronic parts of the aircraft were replaced with foreign parts. The original vendor of the parts was killed when the Benin-Cote d'Ivore war ended. In view of this,we decided to locate a new vendor abroad and so decided to over-invoice the contract. This was done to avoid the excess amount being paid to the vendor and to avoid any future occurrence of this kind. The amount set aside for this over invoicing was $18,885,000.00 USD, which means that if we do not remit this amount out immediately it will be re-invoiced and the total amount will be in the tune of the thing of $18.885,000.00USD. We are sorry that this will come to you as a surprise and we wish to assure you that every arrangement concerning this money has been made. We have been privy to a great deal about your person and we believe that with the right arrangements, you can do this deal that no one else can do.

 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL &gt;From The Desk Of Mr. Mark Blythe. Manager, Procurement Department, African Development Bank (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso West Africa. I am Mr. Mark Blythe, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the A.D.B   In charge of payroll and accrual of funds  from Central Bank of South Africa (C.B.O) account of  late Mr. Ron Akeem who died of heart attack on 1st July 1998.   Since we got information of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.    It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to  you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent  disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the bank treasury  as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Burkina-faso stipulates that if any bank account  was at the time of the death, the money will be  returned to the bank treasury account  as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured in the course of the business and 60 % would  be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country  to dispense the rest of the money. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as  arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the  deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk  free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required information  and necessary documents will be forwarded to you as soon as you reply me back.   Respectfully yours, Mr. Mark Blythe.    E-mail address:markblythe1@hotmail.com

I N E   ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS STILL LOST HIS LIFE BEFORE HE WAS FOUND IN OUR COUNTRY. HIS NAME IS KENNETH MUSA, A FOREIGNER. HE WORKED WITH BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)  before he was murdered by a group of armed robbers on JUNE 2004 in a case which was never made public by the bank. It is to be expected that when a dead body is discovered by the bank this is the next thing that the body will have been expected to pay me for the services rendered to him or her. Unfortunately, as it is right and just now, before the odometer of the bank was stopped by these bandits, I decided to pay this body which was deposited for now on a deposit of ten years which I have in my custody for my personal use.   This is how the deposit was made with my name on the deposit as the beneficiary. But, fortunately, all the arrangements to put claim over this money have been taken care of by the attorney and his company, and my share of the money is 90%   of the total amount.   I have been made to sign a binding agreement, which   binds us together. In case you are not convinced,  please read on. Please, bear with me. I only hope that you will bear with me.   I am Mr James ibobo. I work with a firm. We solicit donations of money and property of special value from a variety of sources. One of the sources from which we get large sums of money is from illegal or under-counted sources abroad who are willing to give us large sums of money for our company. The source of these funds is usually under the guise of dealing with business partners whose names are withheld for now until we confirm this buyer. We have in our possession the names of the alleged source of the funds. We are currently in negotiations with the attorney for the release of the money from him.   At this juncture, we seek your consent to present you as the beneficiary to the money, which you are due to be paid in the next few working days.   We are not interested in any arrangement that might involve you in any way. We only want you to be absolutely sure you will not question this deal when it is over, so please, be rest assured that we are in position to make the payment of this money possible provided you will be absolutely certain of its finality.   As soon as you send us a note, you should also include your contact information for easy and safe communication.   Please, be rest assured that this transaction is risk-free.   It is a transition period for us, because the money is seperate from our salaries. We will prefer that you do the transfer to a reliable account where it will be safer and more reliable.   Please, be rest assured that we are in need of some funds to invest in.   Please, contact us immediately through our private number +229 73 89 73 42, so that we can forward your confidential contact information immediately.   Thanks and God bless you.

I am Asim Ali, the Bank manager of Diamond Bank,   Lome, Federal Republic of Togo. I have urgent and very confidential business  business suggestion for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with   the federal government of Angola, Mr. Paul Nguessane made a numbered   time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at U.S.$21.5 million (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)     in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but   got no reply. After a   year, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Federal Government of Angola   that Mr. Paul Nguessane died in the plane crash On December 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it  from the website below:    http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without   making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Nguessane did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of $21.5 million plus accrued interest was   kept in my bank until recently when I was dealing with my colleagues from the bank. The   fund was intended for purchase of machines and chemicals for the farms and   construction of farms in Surin-Burkina-Faso.We confiscated the sum of US$500 million in the course of   the course of investigation and the bank director and his entire family was indicted. I was able therefore, to negotiate a compromise and release the money to his relatives. However, I have successfully negotiated a new contract with the   federal government of Angola and the money will be paid into the new account   established by the government of Angola for the purpose of   transferring and investing the fund abroad in a profitable venture. This is the reason why I sought for your humble assistance.   I am in a position to make the payment in the following ways: (i) If you agree to be my next of kin. (ii) If you agree to be my next of kin. (iii) If you agree to accept 25% of the money for your services. (iv) If you agree to accept 35% of the money for your services. (v) If you agree to accept a fixed percentage for your assistance. Please, for the sake of   your soul and for the maintenance of the human spirit, you should give up your time to render me your assistance. I shall be delighted if you can be very willing to entertain this a pacific and amity if you will willingly give me your full attention and co-operation for this puerile business. As soon as you reply me back, I shall furnish you with the next step to take in this business venture. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret, but I want you to keep it as a top secret as possible and to refrain yourself from making any move in this business until I am prepared to make the payment in your favour. Until then, you are to keep a very low profile and contact me as soon as you confirm   your readiness to act as my next of kin and also your ability and willingness to handle this project. I am ready to pay out 25% of the total sum to you if you are ready to assist me. I am sure that by this transaction, you will be able    handle this transaction with full freedom. Please, reply immediately if you are interested by fax or e-mail. I am ready to entertain any questions or problem.

My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant from Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire. But because of the war in our country, he was killed in the land dispute in our country. After his death, he entrusted the cash sum of $17.5Million to my late mother for safe keeping in our country. and I am the next of kin to my father so this money was deposited in his bank account here in Abidjan. And from what I understand from the bank records, the bank account was abandoned for a long time then was probably used for drug dealing and arms dealing. It is from this abandoned account that my late father used my name as his next of kin because he did not want me to inherit this money. But I am the next of kin and because of the present land crisis in our country, I can not stand up for myself, so I must seek for someone else to be my next of kin. And since my father's business was in cocoa importation and export, we decided that for the safety of the money, we would like you to move it to your country in a foreign account so that the money will be safe when we get it from our country.

 I WANT YOU TO BE MY GUARDIAN.  Hello Dear, It is Im debut email. I wish to make contact through email,but I'm afraid it will get lost in the sea of emails here at SARAH FIJI UNIT/MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. I am Iba Mustapha, the head of the civil service in charge of procurement of arms and ammunition for the Nigerian armed forces. We are engaged in a trade with the United States of America in Africa region.Our clients have requested for the release of allocated amounts of US$27Million in contract awarded by the government of Nigeria to private arms makers. A contract was awarded, in my department, to install and maintain CCTV network system on Key Landfill, owned by one of our clients. Upon the installation of CCTV system on this land, the contract was awarded, we inspected the contract and found a huge sum, over budget by the government into the tune of US$27Million. This amount was concealed under a VIRGINIA FOLLOWING clause, as all this sumshuld have been last year's profits for our clients. As soon as we discovered this, we immediately sent a letter to the contractor, but got no reply. After a while, we sent a reminder, and finally we discovered, from the contract review and payment clearance agencies that this amount was past due to the client. This sum of US$27Million was classified as Unspent Credits. The contract review and payment clearance agencies handled all the payment clearance for the federal government. Upon further investigation, it was also discovered that the balance of US$13.5Million, which is the balance of the balance of the contract, was lying in a suspense account with the Contract Review and Payment Clearance Agency. This amount was deliberately kept out of the record. The contract was paid and over budget by the government. It was also found out that the contractors who did the installing and maintaining of the CCTV system did not name either their company or their bank accordingly. And the contract was signed, but not completed. So, the balance of US$27Million is still in this account. The reason why I am writing you now is because we have urgent need for a foreigner to come over and claim the funds. I have named a few companies that could handle this project. These companies are: 1) Diamond Bank  2) Wells Fargo Bank  3) Capital One Bank  4) Union Bank  5) BNP Paribas. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this amount is in US Dollars and the British pound is not legal tender in my country. The original contract was signed by both parties, and for all legal and trnsual reasons, I would like you to do the same. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain amount of the money in your account, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper business relationship. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I expect your urgent reply. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all types of expenses you might incur in the course of this transaction, while the remaining 70% will be for me and my family, as I have been specially designed to take care of this project. Contact me as soon as possible with your full names, address, and telephone and fax numbers so that I can forward the necessary documents and documents that will help us get you the necessary accounts and financial institutions. As soon as I get your positive response, I shall provide you with more details that will help you understand the transaction. Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality. Yours faithfully, Iba Mustapha Reply me through this Email:oc_president@hotmail.com

Title: PROPOSAL FOR ASSISTANCE
 PROPOSAL FOR ASSISTANCE Dear Sir,  By way of a business transaction, I discovered a very large sum of money belonging to one of our customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash on the 8th October 2000 in paris that almost took the entire life of the pasengeres on board. Please you will be informed that I have secured the info of a reputable bank here in abidjan, that my late customer had deposited his deposit for the sum of USD$27,500,000,00 (Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only in one of the branch here in abidjan.  When I contacted him on this note, he told me that he deposited this sum in one of the bank for safe keeping and i agreed that if you are going to be my next of kin, we should hash this out amiss.  When we came across the information about the deposit in one of the bank, we were expecting him to come over and claim our money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines but he was really willing to relaunch this project with you as the next of kin.  On that note, I decided to inform you that I have decided to restructure the transaction so that you will be able to claim the money from the bank as the beneficiary.

I am an executive accountant with Federal Government of Benin (FGBB)opolis, capital city of Benin. My father is the former head of state of Cotonou, in the Gold and Natural resources business, and until his death he was a rich cocoa merchant in the capital city. We owned estates in the capital city, and in the course of our trade we were killed by the rebel forces as they invaded our country in August 2000, and since then we have been fighting for our political and financial independence. My mother died when I was a baby, and since then my father took me so special. Before the death of my father on 25TH october 2000 in a hailstorm in the capital city, he secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has this sum of money lying around the secure, bank vault. He told me to look for a local or foreign business partner, or else he would declare the whole year as an MP and claim all the declared assets of the year.   So, I went to look for a foreign partner, and unlike myself decided to sell off the properties and properties of my late father's family and business people in the capital city for a good profit.   I sold off the estates, stores, apartments, hotels, cars and other properties of my late father's family in the capital city and sold off the bank accounts of my late father's family in the capital city.   The proceeds of this sale I made from these cre-ations, I used the money to buy new estates and to set up a new company which will protect my interest in the estate and the interests of the family.   This situation gave rise to the idea of I looking for a foreign partner, as my father so valued his

Title: YOUR REPLY IS NEEDED.
 YOUR REPLY IS NEEDED. Dear, Friend. I hope this may not cause you any embarrassment. Permit me to inform you about myself. I am Miss Verity Harvey, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I must  solicit your confidence in this transaction. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in the Kruger Gold Co. of South Africa , he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings on business . Later in life, his business associate in business affairs informed me of his sudden death and I was compelled to seek for a reliable and trustworthy foreign next of kin who can take care of this transaction. I have since decided to disclose the whole arrangement to you that only a foreign partner can be relied on to take care of this trust and this will ultimately benefit you as we intend to use your name as the next of kin to my father. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Armitage, a wealthy farmer and politician from the mining and oil rich states of South Africa, also died on the same day. He died without a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless as well. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Armitage, also a wealthy farmer and politician, also died from the same cause. This sum of US$7.5 million and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the South Africa Laws, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to my father so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please be patient and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing the transfer, 1.Your Full Name. 2.Your House Address. 3.Your Phone Number. Accordingly, you must have received this letter in your mail    from  Miss Verity Harvey    NOTE: Reply to:verityh_harvey@mail2world.com

Attention Please, I am the head of file department in the bank and I got your contact through one of the foreign customers who was robbed of his life by my branch. The name of the victim was ALEXANDRE BRUNU who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetlinerliner on March 9, 2000 flying from New York to Lome-Togo with the entire passengers on board.  I was informed of his death by the foreign customer who was with me in the bank when I was making the closure of the account. I was sobered by the news and I prayed over it and selected your contact as the person I wanted my bank to contact for this business.  On the transfer of this fund into your account, I sent a routine notification to your private fax number but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his bank that ALEXANDRE BRUNU died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  So now, when I look for a person to carry out this business deal with, I look for such person abroad who can be trusted and dependable, and also possess the money to cover this transfer.  I was sobered by this news and it's just for this reason that I prayed over it and selected your contact. I am Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI and my son is AMIN SHIRANI. I have a proposition for you. On the date of transfer, 40% of the total amount of $14,000,000.00 will be for you, 60% for me and my family and I and 10 % will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction.  Please, you have to be very careful and zealous in your attitude while you are in this business . I am asking because I don't want this money to go into your account as unclaimed bill.  I don't want this money to go into any account of yours. If you are willing to assist me, contact me so that we will discuss the modalities to see you in your country.  If you receive this email, reply me back. I am waiting for your urgent response.. Thank you. Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. We want to start by way of introduction. I am Mr.WAHID IBRAHIM, the Bank manager in charge of foreignreceipts at the  Foreign REMITTANCE DEPT. I got your contact through my  personal search to see if you can assist in this transaction.In my  department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$78.5Million Dollar(USD) in an account belonging to one of our bank customers who died in a plane crash of Malaysia Airlines #91  Boeing 767 Flight 990 which crashed on January 31, 2000  with other passengers on board. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my  department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to  you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody  is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and order in  Malaysia is not in good under such circumstances and I don't want the  money to  slide into the bank treasury either to the tune of tax or to the tune of interest.  It is  necessary to let you know that this money is not for the  selfish use of yourself or your relation but for the public good of  society as   indicated in our banking guidelines. We will fly over to join you for sharing but  I would first like you to furnish us with your personal phone  and fax numbers for easy and safe communication.  In the mean time, you will  be provided with all the needed information from the Bank  as to work out the modalities to claim the money.  Once you have been informed about this transaction, you will be allowed to  apply to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased for  the release of the money. The bank will negotiate  the modalities with you until you agree to the plan. Once you agree, the  bank will send to you a text of the agreement confirming  the successful execution of the transaction. We will share the money  in the ratio of 50% for you and 25% for us and 5%  for expenses incured during the process of this transaction.  Please, be rest assured that the account  where this money is being deposited is in good  standing with the bank and we are ready to assist you  as soon as you indicate your  interest.  Please endeavour to keep this transaction secret and confidential.  Regards,  Mr.WAHID IBRAHIM.  ********************************** BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER: FKN-BOX 8NEF

Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT RESPONSE.
 TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT RESPONSE. FROM THE DESK OF MRS M. TUGU.BANGKOK. BANGKOK,THAILAND Dear, I hope this may not constitute sort of embarrassment to you at this stage in time, But I am seeking your co-operation and trust to enable me present you in a more positive light. The present Government has voted, on fourteenth of July, 1999, to close down all pending cases of unclaimed deposits from Bangkor-Seki,   which included gold and silver mines. This came as a shocker to the Government as they were expecting the depositor to come over and claim his money. It is for this reason that I and my coleagues in the Ministries of Mining and Natural Resources are having a problem in the country. It is to this end that I and my colleagues in the Ministries have been excused to look for a foreign partner in a country of our choice who will assist us in receiving this money and invest it there in a profitable venture. We have been made to sign a binding agreement, which was signed, to bind us together. It is from this that I and my colleagues got the knowledge of the Bangkor-Seki Solid Gold and Silver Mines in Southeast Asia. This mine was owned by the Chinese and their leaders and was under the management of one of their foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash on his way to attend a business deal in the Middle East. When we came to the knowledge of his death, we made this discovery and the deal was cancelled because of his death. The sudden death of this customer was a surprise to all of us and we lost confidence with the Chinese. After discussion with my colleagues, it was decided that we would transfer this money to a foreign account which they kindly agreed to provide. This is because I have the authority of the Director of Contracts Removals to approve this transfer. This money has been floating around the bank for some years now and the bank has no idea about this account. As a matter of fact, the account has no record of a deposit or withdrawal. On the contrary, from what I gather from the accounts and bank records, the account has no next of kin and if I was not careful, this money will one day be forfeited to the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. I and my colleagues have decided to do this because we are government workers and our pay chevrons are not sufficient to cover this unclaimed fund. I do not want this unclaimed fund to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have been made to sign a binding agreement, which was signed, to bind us together. I was made to sign a binding agreement, which was signed, to bind us to a mutual agreement. Hence, my motivation to seek your consent to present you to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased. Under the laws of Bangkor-Seki, all bank accounts of deceased — including this one — shall be traced to the last owner of the account before the bank administration is made to make the necessary enquiries and contact the account of the person whose account this money was originally deposited. He must, however, apply to the bank as the next of kin to the along with his direct and his day care centre where he now lives for his money to be acknowledged as the next of kin. On this note, I have been made to sign a binding agreement, which was signed, to bind us together. I was made to sign a binding agreement, which was signed, to bind us to a mutual agreement.

(RE: TRANSFER OF US$10 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) I am Mr Nelson Abia, Bank of Africa (B.O.A) In:Africa, 24th July, 2003. Post:I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Petroleum Corporation, Mr. William Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(ten million U.S. dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. William Smith died in the plane crash On October 31, 1998, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. William Smith did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to African and international law, at the expiration of 2 (two) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the African and international banking associations if nobody applies to claim the fund. I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of Mr. William Smith so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. All I want you to do for now is to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all; The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your responses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of the bank here in Nigeria. On a routine inspection, I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance of US$24.5 million (Twenty Four million Five Hundredthousand United State Dollars). On further investigation, I discovered that the account holder was a foreigner, and as late as 2004, a citizen of Nigeria. I further discovered that the account holder has since died without a [heir] hence the dormant account remains in the bank and if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing. I would also like you to assist me in transferring this money to your account without delay. The amount involved is (USD$24.5m)NINE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS. Can you agree to this? I would like us to invest this money in a viable business venture but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Andrew Kim was a foreigner too and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. However, I am assuring you that all will not be lost, as the manager of bill and exchange department of the bank here in Nigeria, I still have the authority of my bank president to approve this fund to any foreigner who has correct proof of account with this bank, which you will give us when we sign a binding agreement to give you this information. I will be in Niger at the end of the transfer period to collect the money. If you are willing to assist me, please contact me on my number 00226-7885 74 66, for you to be sure of the funds transfer. All I want is for you to furnish me with your private fax or phone number where I can reach you immediately. When I get this information, I will send you the cheque for the transfer. Please contact me as soon as you confirm to me that you will be the account owner of the account I am going to transfer the money out of. When you receive this mail, send me an e-mail. You have to keep this a secret and assure me that you will not let me down either to yourself or your coleagues because you will be the account owner of the fund.

 PLEASE GET BACK TO ME Dear friend,  I am Dr.Uzoruddin Abacha,Bank of  Africa, Dakar Senegal,Senegal. I have a new email address  which I will be grateful if you could assist me with.  During our investigations and Accounting  exercise,I discovered a dormant  account in our bank which belonged to one of our foreign banking customers who died with his entire family on the 16th  of December,2000 in plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release  it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I  became convinced of the business opportunity  presented to me by this sad accident,if you are honest then I am sure you will  be able to handle this transaction for us.   Please do not hesitate to contact me at once so that I  will send you more details on how we intend to actualize  this proposal.   Thanks and God bless.

I am Mr Robert Williams a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Moreover, I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total value of a contract awarded by my Departmental in the past year / last month to a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to work with us on this project, your share of the sum will be 25% of $26.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid enti!  ality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately, whether or not you are interested in this deal.

This sum of US$12,200,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

Struggling to make ends meet as civil servants in a volatile country. Our lives are made difficult by the unstable government policy of President al-Gada. It is against this background that I and my family moved to the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) several years ago to seek asylum. Although the move was prompted by political issues, such as the disputed presidential election , I am afraid that my present government will not understand or relate to me. I have been nominated by the prime minister, as the next of kin of the late al-Gada to the late president, because the former president was a foreigner and it is in the interest of all parties involved because I am a foreign person. We decided to seek for foreign assistance, as the life and future of my family depend on the funds. At this point in time, the bank account where our family bank in emirate is located in the United Arab Emirates, I and my family are staying with my late father's brother in the UAE. I have decided to seek a foreign partner in a country of our choice where the fund will be properly cleared and transfered. I guarantee that the company will handle this transaction professionally, and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction. Be assured that I and my family are living the life of the Most Happy family. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please, reply me immediately through the above email or call me on my private phone number.

I AM SINCERELY LOOKING FOR A CONCURRENT AND TRUSTWORTHY PERSON DEAR, I AM MR. BILLAND(BRUCE), THE CUSTOMER / LICENSOR OF CAMP BILL &c. We have an account opened with this bank in 1997 Believe it or not, but we still have some funds in the account before the account was discovered by the bank. We were obliged to close the account off when the bank discovered that we had made a living. I was forced to close the account because I don't want the account to be used for any illegal thing. The account was used by some people in the government and some rich black farmers in Africa as a farm in which they lodged their earnings. There is a bill in the bank for the payment of which I was the beneficiary. I now seek your permission to have you stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and also the beneficiary of the account, because I am afraid that my present position will not be enough guarantee you enough time to make this claim.

 I NEED YOUR PERCENTAGE ATTN:DearOne, I am Robert Williams. I am a director with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in London. I am writing in respect of an account which I have with the bank. On June 6, 1999, an America oil consultant/contractor with the South London &amp; Tower Gas Company, Mr. David Ameeraly , made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at £13,000,000.00 (thirteen million pounds sterlings) in my branch.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had actively opposed the government of his region in Nigeria and was consequently driven into exile.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had also been convicted  of tax evasion and was therefore driven into exile.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had also been on the watch-list of the authorities and was therefore reminded of the (exile) on several occassions.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had also been granted indulgences by the government of James A. Baker.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had also been pardoned from the taxes paid by his employer South London Gas Company Ltd.   So, with this in-depth investigation, I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation.

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL CONCORDE TRUST BANK 33, 1,FREET AVON CLUB, LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Sir, I am Concorde Trampled manager, International Commercial Bank Lagos, I got your contact through my personal search but I was really hoping that you would respond to this transaction. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On Monday, 31 July 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$6,000,000.00(Six Million, six Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry died in a plane crash on the 1st of November 2000[with Egyptian  990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it from the website below:  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/egyptair990.list/index.html on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was thwarted. &gt; I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$6,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it; the Bank is closing in on the end of 2002.

Please Can someone please forward to me on my private fax line  this confidential business proposal which I just got from the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources  concerning the transfer of oil sales rights from Nigeria to yours regarding the   sale of a big impracticable contract.   I am Mr.Nasser Hassan,the Auditor General in the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. I am writing this proposal to  solicit your support and partnership in this transaction. On June 6, 2001, a foreign oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$15,000,000.00(Fifteen Million US Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally he was reimbursed with the balance of US$25,000,000.00(Twenty Five Million US Dollars).  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to South Africa banking law, at the expiration of (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain/ obtain from you the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be handled by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address, please furnish me immediately with your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  You should e-mail this e-mail on your reply to this e-mail address jm_foliage@yahoo.co.uk  You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy communication.

On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining corporation,  Mr. Frank Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve  calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the South Africa Mining corporation that Mr. Frank Williams died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out  that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.  Frank Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest  accrued from the years of  interest the bank was due to pay me, when I was still the Director in charge of  the bank.  I told my bank directors and senior staff but they were not  interested in the details. I explained to them that it was because  my bank was still in government administration and they would never know of such  money in their bank. They agreed with me when I was recently informed of  this development.  I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of  kin to Mr. Frank Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.   This application will be made to the  bank as a result of the fact that  he is a foreigner and a South African cannot stand as his next of kin  hence the reason for our  intrusion. All I want from you is your honest co-operation to  enable us see this deal through.   Once  you have received this letter, you should contact me on my  email address  michael_sarr20@yahoo.co.uk   Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Yours Faithfully,  Mr Michael Naya Sarar.

It is because of this problem that I  decided to seek for a foreign  partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use  it for investment purpose such as real estate management or hotel management,  since this money has no person or company to whom it can be traced  and the person who is to act as next of kin  or beneficiary to the deposit will be responsible for all  expenses  incured during the business. I will be forwarding to you the contact of the foreign  partner who should act as next  of kin to the deceased. PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL  TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS: 1) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. 2) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. 3) HIGH COMMISSIONERS RETURN FORM. 4) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES IF YOU ARE NOT AT LEAST 18 YEARS OR OLDER. 5) YOU CANNOT BE A PARTNER OF CRIMES. 6) YOU CANNOT BE A PARTNER OF CRIMES.

From: Mrs. Linda Price.
 I , am writing to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below:My husband Mr.Blankhill was a Gold and Diamond merchant in Abidjan , the economic capital of Guinea . He was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings on business . When my husband was alive he had in his accounts at the Deposit Depository of our Bank in Abidjan , deposits valued at 16 million United State Dollars only, ( 16m US Dollars). Also taken away from his account were these: A bank account in Hong Kong, a secure bank account in Europe , and gold and diamond consignments worth millions of dollars. They also took away a gold medallions necklace. They poisoned him on one of their outings on business and buried him in a cemetery. My poor husband was poisoned by his business associates. Before his death we were sure he died of heart attack, because he did not communicate a word about this death. When he was alive he deposited the deposit of these consignments under the management of a Security Company in Europe . The consignment deposited in the security company was guarded with the company's seal of approval on it, so we took away the security company's seal and deposited this news of this happening in your private mailbox. Then we went to the security company to notify them that my husband was poisoned by his business associates. They sent us the file on deposit of these consignments with the security company. We are now waiting for the next of kin to come over to us for us to present them as the next of kin to my late husband. I am Mrs. Linda Price and I am the only surviving son of Mr.Blankhill Price, a Gold and diamond merchant from Ivory coast . I am black and I am divorced. My late husband had a policy of non-Black owned bank accounts. Because of this, I was afraid and worried when my late husband was poisoned by his business associates. I have since found out that my late husband was poisoned by his business associates and that I am the next of kin to my late husband. It is only to terminate this business opportunity that I have discovered that you may be able to assist me. Although I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will be well at the bank within a short while. As soon as I receive your reply, I will give you more details and relevant documents that will help you to proceed in the transaction. Please whenever you get this mail, reply me immediately through my secondary mail box: lp_price@tiscali.com. You should also include your private fax and telephone numbers for easy communication.

Dear  sir, How are you and your family today? I hope that you are all okay?  In my office I discovered an abandoned sum of $5000.5 million U.S. dollars.  This money was kept in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2004 in plane crash.  Since I got the information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the money unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.   As civil servants we are not allowed to operate or own bank accounts abroad.  Hence we are going to solicit your assistance as the foreign customer's next of kin to ensure that the money gets into your account.   We promise not to interfere with your account being a civil servant who is not allowed to operate any account, we promise to give you 20% of the total money, 5% will be set aside to take care of any expenses that might be incurred by both parties during the transfer process.   We will also provide you with all the necessary contacts  and information to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.   We promise to bless you with the most holy and sainthood nature of servants of the Master.  If you are interested, please reply immediately to me.   Please send me your confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication.   Best regards, Mr.Bulldozer Ali.

I have decided to do this only on behalf of my Bank and also on behalf of my bank as it is the only way i can see to transfer this money out of the country. But I am afraid that I will not be able to do this alone and I need your support as I am about to transfer this money to any account you will nominate. In my earlier correspondence with you, I made it very very clear that this money was kept in a bank account in EUROPE because we do not have any bank account in this part of the world. The amount in the account is $36.4 million dollars. I would have liked to have transferred this money to any account nominated by you but I could not bring myself to do it that way because of my government's tax payer funded budget deficit. I am sorry but I needed your help to make this happen. I will give you 25% of the total money transferred to your account while the balance of the money in the account will be mine. I want you to make arrangements immediately to come over to your country for future sharing of this money according to percentages previously mentioned. If this proposal is acceptable by you, kindly furnish me immediately with your private phone number for easy and safe communication. I will pay all expenses incurred in the course of this transaction, provided that you will not reduce the amount of the transfer for any reason. I have secretly discussed this matter with the Chief Financial Officer of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth transfer of this money to any account nominated by you. At the conclusion of this business, you will be entitled to 20% of the amount, 75% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Please please, I need your assistance to finalize this transaction with you and to ensure that no mistake is made during the transfer process. I wait for your early response. Yours Faithfully, Martin Sarr Please Reply To This Email sonofmonim@mail2world.com

Dear Friend, I am Stellasir Asos, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and trust to which I have been legally bound since I was a child. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($25,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such amounts. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $25.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of our Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount.

I am an Executive Accountant with the Benin Parish Government here in Cotonou Benin. I got your contact through my personal search when i was searching for a good and reliable person to handle this confidential transaction. In the course of our auditing, we discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1993. The owner of this account is Mr. Charles Paul, an American and civil servant. He died in the year 2000, and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it.                                                  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE", I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

Title: Assist.
 Assist. I want to inform you that this proposal is real and it is serious. I am Mr.Nasser Hassan,the Auditor General of Bank of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be of huge mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died withhis entire family on November 30th 2001 in autocrash plane crash at an altitude of 24,000 feet (610meters). Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as thenext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as thenext of kinor relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don?t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trsfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the deceasedindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97im immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your’s faithfully, Mr.Nasser Hassan

I have urgent and very confidential business  proposal for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa  Mining Corporation, Mr. Frank Benjamin made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve  calendar months, valued at US$35,000,000.00(Thirty  Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in my branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that  Mr. Frank Benjamin died in the plane crash of 31 October 2000, an Egyptair Flight 990, with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below.  From the website:  http://www.egyptair.com/passionate_person/passionate_passenger.htm  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. &gt; I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Frank Benjamin did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$35,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of  year.  According to the South Africa Banking law, at the expiration  of(six) years), the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next of kin to Mr. Frank Benjamin so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter  that will put you in place as the next of kin.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you nominated bank account.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately to  moff@sify.com or call me immediately on my private telephone number 234-80-7896-7777.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Please upon your assitance, you should not hesitate to reach me immediately on my alternative number 234-

Title:  URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
  URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr.Sushil B. Shah, the Manager in credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business propos of a transaction. On with my business I want to introduce a transaction that would be very beneficial to both of us. I got your contact from the international directory in my search for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten million five hundred thousand U.S. dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on the 8th of July 2000 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Cantonese must learn to read and write sign language.   We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.  I will be your foreign partner and you will instruct me on how to apply for the release of the money from the bank on your behalf.  Please, you have been advised to keep business as a secret between both parties.   Yours faithfully,  Mr.Sushil B. Shah                                                                                    SERVO ACCOUNT NUMBER 300,335,547.169                                                                                          ============ Forwarded message ============ From: maryam abacha.

Title: urgent response 
 urgent response  &gt;From the Desk of Koutaba The Hon. Principal,EEOC.Liberia. Dear Friend, I am Mr.Koutaba The Hon. Principal,EEOC.Liberia. a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),Liberia.I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00(twenty- five million united states dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 747 Airways Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it from the website below.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had actively opposed the government of his country, Ivory Coast,and is therefore now at large and unclaimed. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly, unlike most unclaimed bodies, has a SIMPLE SETTLEMENT AND ACCOUNTANT FOLLOWING IF HIS FUND IS REMITTED. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6(six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of Ivory Coast Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you your bank account information immediately and inform you about the modalities available to us. We can at this point quietly look for a reliable overseas interlocutor who will act as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly, so that the transaction will be most profitably without the need for a hitch. At the termination of this business, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as compensation,70% for your effort/input/interest,5% for the expenses incurred during the course of this operation,10% for charitable purposes and 75% for the consumption of your own kind. Please, you have been advised to treat this information with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. I will be glad to hear from you immediately. Regards, Koutaba The Hon. Principal,EEOC.Liberia. ______________________________________ E-mail:kephd@latinmail.com

(ASSISTANCE) Dear Sir, I am Mr.Mosesi.Munjib of ASSISTANCE TOKEN COMPANY(ADBANK). I am a national of Assista Island who has moved to Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire from Cote d'Ivoire where i work in the bank now.I am in charge of foreign customer accounts, bank account  and foreign remittance/ charge accounts in the bank. I have been in this bank for ten years having been  appointed as a bank director  to the bank's management board after ten years of the previous bank director who died with his entire family on November 13,2003 in an automobile crash. Since we got information about his death on a business transaction  that they  executed in the bank, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it if it is not paid to him, but we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin or relations have been killed, and his bank account is surrounded by the security company where the bank director  is headquartered, and  the company cannot release the money unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the director as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him in the  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I sought your permission to open the account  in the bank to enable me send the money to whomever  I wish in the name of my bank to be the next of kin or relation of the director. As  we planned this, we executed an agreement with the bank which stipulated that if you agree to this, the money  would be released to you as soon as  you apply to the bank as the next of kin or relation of the director.Upon  receipt of your reply, I will forward to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is 100%risk free; on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the  total sum as gratifications,while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that  might be incurred by you in the course of the transaction. I am awaiting your instant reply reply through my alternative email account. You should also include your:  daytime and/or evening phone numbers for easy communication. Do not forget to include your fax number for easy and safe  retrieval. EXPECT YOUR REPLY. Yours faithfully, Mosesi Mballhe.

From: THE SECRETARY Dear Sir, I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will  be well at the end of the day.I am Mr.Paul Marcus, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

The contract was awarded under the magnificent South Africa Public-Private Partnership (SPP) programme for the Supply of Petroleum Products, which is why it has been delayed for so long.  Now the contract has been completed and the payment successfully cleared in South Africa, the contract has been awarded for further awarding to the next of kin in the contract department. The payment is made to the next of kin according to the rules of the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct.  As an officer of the department, I have direct responsibility for the payment of this contract contract. I have written to you to enable you get this contract and also so that you can be presentable on contract documents.

Title: Greetings from james obi
 Greetings from james obi ATTN: Sir/Madam. I am james obi a local Bank manager in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.I got your email contact during my search for an overseas reliable contact.I was hoping you could be able to assist me in this transaction.Please,I need your assistance for two reasons.Firstly,as the Bank Manager  I have a policy of not permitting foreign accounts to  exist in my country. This is because, as the Bank Manager  of one of the prime banks here in Abidjan, I know of one account  opened by a foreigner with the account number 14-11-2957-801  which I will give to you if you are willing to be my partner.Secondly,I have  in my possession the account number 14-11-2957-801 which I will give to you  if you are willing to be my partner. In the course of our daily banking processions we discovered an account opened by a foreigner with the account number 14-11-2957-801. On further investigation we  discovered that the account has long been dormant and all trace of the account is  from the end of the last century. This sum of US$28M is still sitting in the dormant account and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No  body will ever come forward to claim it. According  to the laws of the land at the expiration of  (seven) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Cote d'Ivoire  Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. We are looking for a foreigner who will act as the beneficiary to-  ensure that the money is successfully transferred over to any account  where you will be capable of receiving it. The person to be  beneficiary is on whose behalf we are interested, because the bank  considers any foreigner as a beneficiary,  regardless of his nationality. In fact, we are willing to give you 20% of the total  amount. But please, we need your full co-operation. If there is any such thing as  double binds in this transaction,it is it because we are still in negotiations with the bank over  the modalities to finally finalize this transaction. At the conclusion of this transaction, you will be given the  total sum of 210M, which is the difference  between the two sum. It is based on this that I got your contact. In  addition, you will be given 20% of the total amount, which is the  80% of the amount. Please, I want you and your company to stand as the real  beneficiary of this money,  so that no body will stand in the way of this money ever getting into  your bank account.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in Abidjan until you  agree to my last minute change of heart and to help me carry out this  transaction for which you are being offered 20% of the total  amount. Once you have been convinced  of your righteousness please contact me immediately so that we can proceed  resolving this matter together. Till then, remember to  contact me on my alternative email address: obi_24_legal@yahoo.co.uk  Best regards, james obi

Title: ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO.
 ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. Dear Sir, I have a confidential business relationship with Mr.Michael Nelson, a member of the South African Mining Corp. It may interest you to know that I got your contact through my private search agency. These are the facts, as I gather them from his private search agency: 1. Your address 2. Your telephone and fax numbers 3. Your bank name and address 4. Your branch and fax number 5. Your personal fax number and contact information. As the President of the South African Mining Corp, I have the authority of my partners to demand a certain amount of foreign exchange from a particular customer, which was twenty four million, seven hundred and fifty thousand united states dollars.  This amount was intended for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and plantations on behalf of foreign clients. As the senior partner of the mining corporation, I was entitled to a certain amount of foreign exchange quota for the year 2000.  Based on these facts, I decided to seek for a reliable and independent person/company via which this money could be transferred.  The financial company I have chosen for this transaction is very much aware of who we are dealing with and how we got the money in the first place.  Due to my position as the senior partner of the mining corporation, I am in a very sensitive position to not only receive this amount of money, but also be able to transfer it without any hitch.  I am afraid that if I do not remit this amount of money immediately, it will get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is why I have chosen you to be a partner to enable us transfer this money out of South Africa.  I will be with you in-country in no time.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in South Africa.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through my e mail: michael_nelson1@myway.com Thank you as I wait for your urgent response.  Mr.Michael Nelson.

So,the money was fixed for twelve                       years, but is not transferable because                               So,after                    The fund is no. 33, Company A, Lower Manhattan, Flatiron, Manhattan           COMPULSION, THE PROPOSAL IS WHEREIN OUR BANK.

Title: ASSISTANCE
 ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I think it will be necessary to solicit your assistance in a business of this magnitude, but in a confidential manner.I work with the UNICEF Child & Adolescent Development Programme in some countries. I am the Regional Director in charge of the Early Childhood Development Programme in one of the industrialised countries. Recently I discovered an abandoned sum of US$16.5 million dollars (sixteen million five hundred thousand U.S. dollars) . In an account un-completed in the bank,the author had deposited this money in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2005 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In view of this, it is very necessary that the money be transferred out of the bank without any delay and it is only by direct transfer that it can be transferred into any foreign account. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In view of this, it is very necessary that the money be transferred out of the bank without any delay and it is only by direct transfer that it can be transferred into any foreign account. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In view of this, it is very necessary that the bank make arrangements to get the additional sum of US$10 million dollars from the additional bank account of any of the banks located in Europe. I will be the first to admit that this proposal is strange but I believe that time is of the essence and we shall all work out the modalities to finalize this project smoothly. At the eleventh hour, however, it is possible that the bank might decide to block this transaction. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to entertain this proposal, you should contact us immediately through our above telephone number. We would appreciate it very much if you could contact us immediately. In the light of all above, I am at your disposal to give you 30% of the total amount. However, you should not entertain any fear as we are on top of all arrangements to ensure a smooth transfer of the fund into any account nominated by you. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Please, do not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation, Yours sincerely, John Paul Carton.

 miss umer Dear friend, I miss umer  your email was very helpful in arranging this transaction.  When I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy person that will assist me in receiving money and valuables  that belong to my late father (or will  if suitable be given to me) that is why I needed your assistance.  I am Miss umer Butler  a female member of the international first world bank (Finance Trust House) in  Geneva,  Switzerland. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out  this transaction that is as  very much for my personal and future welfare.  I am Miss umer Butler  a female member of the finance trust house.  I deposited the sum of US$18Million  (Twenty-eight million two hundred and twenty  thousand US dollar) in a bank branch in the year 2000.  On further investigation, I found out that the bank  forgot to declare the existence of the account to the  bank as we are not allowed by the law of the bank to operate   accounts where the owner is a female and i am a male.    So we will start the  first transfer with US$18Million plus the balance of US$18Million  worth of bank  assets into your account.  Upon receipt of your positive response, we shall send to you   the information needed to start the transfer.  Please send your reply to:   ron_butler@yahoo.com I am aware of the situation in my  country.  I had a female member of the finance trust house who worked with the Geneva  Chamber of Commerce and Tourrism and she trusted me enough to send   a photo of the account to prove that the account is real and that we can have   the money properly. When I got your email address, I contacted you to   help us carry out this deal.   When I got your email address, I exchanged e-mails with you   to enable us proceed.   Miss umer  also recommended  to me  that you should not fail to send me your email   address, so i did not abort the transfer but luckily   i heard from her   that you    are doing fine and i decided to keep this transfer secret for   safety  until i hear from you   again.  I have decided to give you 20% of the total money   after the transfer   after which time the remaining balance will be yours when you   confirm your   delivery to my on (: Miss umer  at  bank) concerned with my   direct   and  confidential     phone and   fax    confidential     confidential     Tel/ FAX:  921 444 444

MUSA GARUBA from Akita Abidjan. I work with the Hellenic  Foreign Trade Department of the gold and diamond corporation. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the  Greek Petroleum Corporation, Mr. William Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 50,000, 000,000.00pds (Fifteen Million Pounds and  Eighteen Million Pounds), in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.    After a  month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Greek petroleum corporation  that Mr. William Smith died from an automobile accident. On further  investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. William Smith did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$50, 000, 000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim  it. According  to the laws of my country at the expiration of  (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Greek Petroleum Corporation if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as a next of kin to Mr. William Smith  so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government employees. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and for the transfer of the fund into any account  that you will provide. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will be used for the  transfer. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 40/60/20.    Please, I want you to treat this matter as top secret. If you are willing to assist us, do contact us immediately via the above  private e-mail  for more details.   PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

I am Mr.Gonzalo Aubiner, Bank of Botswana, House of Bank, South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$15,000,000.00(Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999 air crash accident at Benin Republic Airport in Benin,  with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it in your country's airline's website. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the South African Government were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, so that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. The banking law and order here in my country stipulates that if such sum of US$15,000,000.00 is not declared by the next of kin to Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu, the bank will report the whole transaction as farm fund.  Upon this discovery, I decided to do business with you and get your consent for the transfer of this money to your account.  At first, I will like you to entertain this thought as to why you are willing to assist us in this transaction. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce, I believe it was because of their low profile that we were able to collect this information. I am presently in need of a foreign partner to invest this fund into, but I can offer you 15% of the total amount, 10% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the transfer process and the remaining 70% will be for me as my investment.  If you are interested in this deal, kindly get back to me by sending me your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please endeavour to keep this transaction confidential, to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.  Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. Mr.Gonzalo Aubiner.

 GOOD DAY  Dear Sir,  I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal,   which I got from your email address   while researching for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner   who could handle transfer of this magnitude.  I am Mrs Helen Harrison, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am married to Mr. Donald Harrison   who is a miner in gold and diamond ore settlements in the Kruger Gold .   province of South Africa and we are all but lucky to have escaped unscathed during the last   war in my country. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operations to enable us   receive the sum of US$18,000,000,000.00 (Eighteen million five hundred thousand   United States Dollar) in your account within 14 working days.   I will start by telling you the full story about myself and my family.   Later, you can talk to me face to face to enable us to conclude a very   successful transaction. In fact, I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this   country as a civil servant(A Banker)), we are not allowed to operate a foreign   account and would eventually raise an eye brow   on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the   reason why it will require a second-fellow or fellow who will forward claims   as the next of kin to the bank so that the proceeds of this account   will be paid to him or her,   This is simple, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount   when the fund is transferred to your account,   70% when the fund is in the bank account and 5%   for any expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.   Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as I am still in service and intend to retire   from service after we conclude this deal with you.

Title: Greetings from Mr. John Murrell
 Greetings from Mr. John Murrell Dear Sir/Madam, I wish to begin by introducing myself. I am Mr. john murrell a native of South Africa and I am an accountant with BNP Paribas. I have an urgent &amp; confidential business suggestion for you. On June 6, 2001, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. John P.F. Hayward made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$24,800,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars)prior to transfer to my account. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. John P.F. Hayward died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John P.F. Hayward did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of USD$24,800,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John P.F. Hayward so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will bring will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all; The paperwork for this project will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via email. Regards, Mr. John Murrell.

From:                        From:                You must have heard over the press about the seizure of the  gold and  diamond companies accounts in Switzerland by the President of  Switzerland, Jean Claude Ashby. The accounts were seized by the government because they were  held by non-Swiss citizens. The accounts of the companies were frozen and gold and  diamond worth millions of dollars was discovered in our treasury. Unfortunately, our banking system  was sabotaged by our President, who was able to get around the banking laws  and get us to sign a binding agreement that subject all banks to  a central bank resolution. This agreement was signed and approved by  the president himself. The documents that were discovered by the  investigation team were deliberately not shared by the bank staff and  the bank board of directors. It is this land problem that prompted my  sudden investigation and I now seek your permission to make this  transfer to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that  should you be willing to assist, your share of the sum will be 25% of the  total transfer sum, 70% for me and my friends, while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer. The business itself is 100%  safe and absolutely confidential. Please, if interested, send through my email  the following information, to enable me start the transfer process: 1.Your Full Name: 2.Your House Address: 3.Your Phone Number and Fax Confirmations Number for easy  communication.As soon as I get your positive response, I will send you the details of the transfer. Waiting for  your urgent reply. Yours  respectfully,  JACK WILSON POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret and top secret. The trust and confidence that you will  repose on me as a person who will be in  perfect accord with every law of the land.If you are interested, contact me through this email, jackwilson_2003@yahoo.co.uk Regards,    J.W.

My father's first wife was my mother's second wife, she had given birth to three children, all of whom died during the land dispute.

Title: RE:  REPLY    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
 RE:  REPLY   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Mr.Richard Gormley HOBBLESIDE (UNITED ARAB EMIRATES)  Dear Sir,  I am Mr.Richard Gormley, a native of Limpopo,  Republic of West Africa, and I am an executive accountant with the  African Development Bank (A.D.B)  in West Africa. We have urgent need for a reliable and competent foreign partner,  with whom we can carry out a successful transaction. On  September 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the  Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve  calendar  months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)  in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly died  from an automobile accident with his family along with his wife and only daughter.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his  bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$26,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of  (Six)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of  kin to Mr. David Ameeraly, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of  kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor  for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5%  for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction .  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this e-mail address immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  If you are interested, please reply immediately to  me via this email address, with your full name,address, and the private telephone and fax number of your bank where the bank will transfer the money into.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, destroy it immediately.  Thank you as I await your response. Mr. Richard Gormley.  +229-32-166-123.

Abballa , an  auditor with BNP Paribas, one of the prime  providers of audit and accounting service to the   Bank of Africa in Dar es Sala Mabry-les-Sef. We are having a   problem.   The audited account of one of our prime customers here in Dar es Sala Mabry-les-Sef with   account number 14-935-63-089 with account name   ZIbrahim Moussa died suddenly on 27th of october 1999   with the whole family on board.   A native of Abidjan , he was an oil dealer with the   National Oil Corporation in Abidjan and also owned a beauty parastatals in   Abidjan and also used to frequent this bank on his main business trip   to stock up his bank accounts with foreign currency. Which bank did he use this money for investment?   He was a pensioner and he died without making a will, and   all attempts to trace his next of kin were   fruitless.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that ZIbilli Moussa   owned no kin or relations in his village Sef. He also confided in me the last time he was at his   office that nobody except the bank accountant knew of his account in this bank. So [that is why] I sought    for   a   reliable  person with   the   name of   whose  bank account does   belong  to    a good  person   and trust   the  person  to act as   next of kin to ZIbilli Moussa and   transfer to   this Bank the  sum of USD20,000, 000(USD20 MILLION) for   our   mutual   benefit. And if you agree to my   proposal, all  necessary   necessary   information   I will send to you as   soon as  you confirm your readiness to   accommodate my   request. In order to avert this negative development, I now seek your   assitance as   to   grant me your   unreserved   cooperation   to carry out this   transaction with you.   NOTE: In the light of   this information, I seek your   unreserved   trust and confidence  which   will be most needed in this   transaction  and I sincerely    hope   you will be    able to   handle   this transaction with    assurance   that    your   opinion     and   action   will be  very much appreciated .

Title: FROM THE DESK OF (JOE M W CAMPBELL) ATTN.DEAR Friend,  My name is Mr. joe mcabbe. I was the credit officer of the Bank of Africa Ouaga. I am writing to solicit your assistance in a business deal involving the transfer of US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million US Dollar) to your account. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15,000, 000.00 ( fifteen million dollars ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Burkina Faso stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after six years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.  You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Title: From: Mr.Tony Gindo Tel: 00229 757 0677 E-mail: tgindo@hknetmail.com Attention: President/CEO. We want to introduce a business deal to you that will be of great interest to you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Dr. Ahmed Ben Chagoury made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million Dollar) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Dr. Ahmed Ben Chagoury died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via this website here. I have since then, placed this money amounting to US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million Dollar) in a bank account for safe keeping. I sent a reminder to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Dr. Ahmed Ben Chagoury died from an auto-accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Dr. Ahmed Ben Chagoury had actively opposed the Government of his country Nigeria and was consequently buried in the cemetery as a tomboy. It is only a girl who knows not to stand as an heir to her father. The request of a girl as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that a boy is the next of kin to a woman and he did not want that. I therefore, as a matter of policy of minimum 5 years, reject for a girl child the claim of this fund. I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the proceeds of this fund would be released to you as the next of kin to the deceased, without any further delay I am willing to give you 25% of the total funds after the completion of this transaction. I will need your consent to proceed hence I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Regards, Mr. Tony Gindo

Title: From the Desk of Mr Alejandro Eric G.Tintaye. Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources (Buenos Aires, Argentina).                                 Confirm Message. I am Mr.Alejandro Eric Tintaye the first and the only surviving son of late Mr ANDREW TINTAYE, a gold and coal merchant who died in gold &amp; coalmine accident at Happy Valley Ore complex, Kasab County, Zimbabwe in your country. According to my father, my mother died when I was a baby and since then my father took me so special because as a boy I was never seen or heard from any other parent. Since then my father took me to the wealthy parts of Zimbabwe to deposit the sum of US$8.5 million (Eight million five hundred thousand U.S. dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, before he was murdered. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in the neighbouring counties. It is by this means that my father intended to transfer the money to overseas, but unfortunately he was murdered by the opposition, who were using his dead money to pay off their political adversaries. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in the neighbouring counties. This is the reason why I decided to transfer the money to an overseas account, but this is where my husband's business with the security company ended.                      Important thing to mention is that according to the law of the land here in South Africa at the expiration of 7 years (seven) from the date of expiration of the current contract, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. This is the reason why I have contacted you urgently to  assist in transferring this money to your account for safe keeping pending our arrival in your country for subsequent sharing between us.                                                                                                                           Note that all arrangement regarding this transaction has been made so thatwe can fly over to join you in your country for a while, before we give up hope of doing business with you.

From:  FADAKA ALI. Abidjan - Cote D'Ivoire. I am the manager of bill and exchange at the the foreign remittance department of Cote d'Ivoire in Africa. I got your contact through my personal search  on the web. We agreed to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to your account  where it will be lodged for safety and subsequent disbursement since  we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude  this deal with you. I have a proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Cote d'Ivore National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$1,500,000.00 (One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Cote d'Ivore National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without MAKING A WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$1,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Cote d'Ivore Law, at the expiration of  (seven) years; the money will revert to the ownership of the Cote d'Ivore Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to  Mr. David Ameeraly so that the proceeds of this money will be transferred into your account as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly.  Note that you are entitled to 25% of the total sum,70% for me and my partners, while 5% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 5% will be set aside to compensate  anybody who will be hurt during the transfer process.  I will be in Cote d'Ivore at the end  of the transfer process and I will give you more details on request.  I prefer you reach me immediately through this email  account:  fadakaha@yada.com  Thanks and regards  MR FADAKA ALI

Dear Sir, I am Mr.Alvaro Yusuf, Bank of Africa (B.O.A.C)Ouagadougou Burkina Faso, West Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30, 000,000.00(Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$30, 000, 000.00 and the interest it accrues to the date of deposit is what I now intend to use to fund a company's development in my country.I have since lodged a formal complaint with the high commission in my country about this, but I can assure you that you will not be made to suffer any sort of financial or other harm as a result of my discovery to this development. As a matter of fact, I could have this money sent to any of your reliable and trustworthy foreign bank accounts.What I need from you is to provide immediately your bank account where we can share the money and also to give us a very strong assurance that you will not seat on the money to avoid the share being transfered into your account.If you are willing to do this, kindly forward to me your contact information for easy and safe communication.Please treat this matter with secrecy and utmost urgency. I am ready to give you this undertaking because I want us to be sure that this operation is totally legal and risk free. As soon as I receive your positive response, I will send you the details of the account where the money will be shared.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thank you. Mr.Alvaro Yusuf.

 ATTN.Dearest. Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Marian G.Kabore, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining, Natural Resources and Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.                                                       ;                                                                            It is with God our lord that we commit this sin.                                In Novateenth 2007, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000,000.00(twenty five million dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died in the plane crash On January 31, 2008, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below :   http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin resulted in no success. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees rules, as refugees.                The amount USD$25,000,000.00 is being used to build and renovate high rise estate in a residential area of Johannesburg, South Africa. The occupants of this estate are being paid for the employment they performed for my bank. The residence is owned by my clientele and his relatives. The owner of the residence is deceased and since there is no next of kin to claim the funds, the money will be transferred to the custody of the South Africa Civil Service Commissions and probate/administrative authorities in South Africa for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I do not want this money to go into the coffers of the South Africa Government. Therefore, to avert this negative development, I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my clientele to look for an overseas bank account where the funds will be transferred for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I do not want this money to go into the coffers of the South Africa Government. The amount USD$25,000,000.00 is the management fee paid to my bank by the bank to solicit for your fund in a business deal.

I am MR TOMSON MARTINS, a member of the Federal Government Officers' Association (FGOPA) and former member of the Political Violence Investigation Department (P.V.I.C) of the Federal Government of Nigeria. P.V.I.C stands for Public Vigilance Department. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Shell Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Shell Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it from the website below: &gt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

This sum of USD$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 50% for me and 45% for you and 5 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email please include your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

This sum of USD$36,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreign partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately to me immediately your full names,address, telephone and fax numbers so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Thanks and regards. Master James Obi

This money came as a result of a contract awarded by my   head office in the past and rightfully so, I had planned for the delivery of these   contracts to the head office of the Federal High Commission for Human and  Administrative Rights, West Africa.  On the delivery of this contract, my head office received a certified   notification from the contracting agency, which we are not allowed to exceed that we   have received from the head office of the Federal High Commission for Human and  Administrative Rights West Africa.  It is because of this that we are now in need of a foreign partner,   who will also stand as the foreign beneficiary to the contract and provide the   bank account where the money will be purchased. We are allowing you all to continue your   services to a top bank account, but we want very much for us to continue   our lives for the benefit of all parties and hope you will honor to provide this   necessary assistance to us.  I have notified you of the remaining steps we are going to take for   our benefit and in order to assure you that our lives are real and we will never let you   forget it. After which we will come over to your country to settle the   sums of dollars and to let you know the actuality of the transaction.  As soon as we receive your reply, we will send to you the text of   the application which you will fill and submit to the bank, which will   then put you in   charge of the entire project.  Best regards,   Mr.Jame Abacha. FHSCRH.

I  made a numbered fixed deposit for twelve calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand  Pounds (US$24,500.000.00) in his branch. Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Hassan Abacha died in the plane crash of 22 July, 2000, an  on-going investigation revealed that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next-of-kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Hassan Abacha did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$24,500.000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the South Africa Law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Hassan Abacha, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next-of-kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 50% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

 Title: feedback 
 feedback  Dear Sir, I'm Mr American Mike stone, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an executive account officer with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. However, I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction, for now. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an executive account officer, and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $18.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in to the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources here in South Africa. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $18.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe; your share will be 25% of the $18 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or my e-mail address:mikesite@oxfordrail.com whether or not you are interested in this deal.If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, for fear of your safety. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Sincerely yours, Mr. Mike Stone TEL: 874-76 60 60 60

 Urgent Business Relation from Nigeria. Please Reply This Mail.  Dear Friend, I am Mr. David Alberici, who works as a financial services director with Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)   in Abidjan, Lagos. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Alberici made a numbered time (fixed) deposit  for twelve calendar months, valued at US$6,000,000.00(Six Million,Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Alberici died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Alberici did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$6,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of  (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Alberici so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.

 Urgent Business Relation Dear Sir, I am Mr.blondomar_1999 the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank, Lagos Branch.I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation C.P.MPC made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$22,000,000.00(twenty two million, five hundred thousand dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a Spouse or Child Custody for the next of kin, so my proposal was that the deposit be rescinded immediately so that my Head of Department can proceed on his assignment. This is how it came about this way. On the course of the last twelve years, the Nigerian government has spent US$13.5Million(13.5x15 million,Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in Coal Mine Rehabilitation. This money was generated by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and I, as a result of our posts in the bank, I am the Head of the bank and I take orders from me. On this discovery, my first duty is to notify the above bank, so that you can be provided and inherit the above bank account. This fund was generated from unclaimed contract royalties, and until this time was being banked in the bank as a treasure trove for the Government of Nigeria. This money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Sub-Saharan African countries.

Title: ATTN. Please Read For Yours      Dear Friend, I know this email will come to you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am using the only secured, confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.     I am Mr. John O. Williams, Bank official in China's Great shanghai banking district. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with China National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. John Anderson made a numbered time(fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$65,000,000.00(Six million five hundred thousand dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. John Anderson died in a plane crash, with the whole fleet of his plane on SQ-IFR flight EB88 from Miami, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,August 8, 2000. And no other person knows about this account because he(Mr. John) died overseas, and all his documents and money is floating around the bank.   Now,the bank is expecting your reply from me now. So I decided to search for a foreigner who will act as the beneficiary to the account and I found that out it was going to be a scam account and all.  I told the bank employee that I will pay for this account with my own share after the successful transfer of the fund to your account from any foreigner who will cooperate with me. The bank employee said that he heard my voice and agreed to transfer my share to any foreigner's reliable account which you are going to nominate.  So I will just have to pay 100% of the fund to an account that is going to be provided by you when the fund gets to your account. On that note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreign partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, such as real estate portfolio management.   This is the reason why I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down. With my influence and the position of the bank employee, we can transfer this money to any account nominated by you, providing you with a rountable e-mail address for easy and safe communications.   Best regards, John O. Williams.

 Urgent Reply From: Mr. Troy Martins ATTN:Sir/Madam You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally. I am Mr. Troy Martins, credit officer of the Union Bank of South Africa here in Johannesburg-South Africa, I got your contact through one of my personal search programs. If you are interested in my proposal,please let me know so that we can proceed to negotiate the modalities for seeing this transaction through.I am contacting you based on trust and confidentiality that we will provide to each other as regards this sensitive financial transaction.Please, reply immediately so that we can proceed. I will be glad if you could provide me with your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication. Please, call me on my private number 0022505731066 for more details. Note also that all correspondence must be by fax or email because of the confidential nature of this transaction. Coming Down: South Africa,I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation for the benefit of all parties. I feel a responsibility to seek your confidence in this transaction and to entrust more trust in your hands as regards this financial transaction involving a foreign partner. In order to transfer the sum of US$12.500,000,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) into your account,it was thought only a matter of time till our countrymen came over and claimed our money because the fund was lodged in a nailed account. The writer/director of the movie, Mr. John Woo directed this scene in which our protagonist, played by me, is locked in a horrible cell with the other convicts. He is being held under the Special Powers Act, of South Africa, for the crime of 'Treason' (as I am sure you all know, it is forbidden by law to operate an account that exceeds US$200,000.00/1,000,000.00IN 100.00, 000.00 USD),and he is being held in such a deplorable prison, I decided to write to you, so that the whole world would see this terrible &amp; tragic situation. We do not know each other personally before now, but this time of year, China comes to South Africa, to purchase lots of South African items. My late partner and I had planned to invest our share of the money in any viable business, but I can not invest on my own account, because of my imprisonment. I am appealing to you now to stand in as the official account holder of this money, so that we can be able to retrieve this money and put it into any viable business. I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of the bank where the money will be remitted. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount;70% will be for me,while 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during the time of transaction.I look forward to your earliest reply to mrtroymartins200@yahoo.co.com, best regards, Mr. Troy Martins

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as  a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

S. Dollars ($8,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and connivance of a foreign   company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil  Service code of conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $8.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction by providing us with a foreign account to remit the said amount, then 25% of the total amount will be for you as a regard to the expenses incurred in the course of the transaction , 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or my email address:kevinachmed@rediffmail.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

 from: Omar Goma From: Omar Goma (Jubilee Bank) Old Office Building,Fulton Bank, Johannesburg South Africa. Dear Friend, I wrote to seek your help for a money transfer. I am Mr.Omar Goma, a senior staff in the Bank.I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On a business transfer of $10m, I deposited the sum of $10m in the bank vault of my branch. I asked my Head Office to instruct the Bank to write to me for the transfer, but they did not. After several months, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from the Head Office that the bank did not write to me either. I later found out that the head office of my branch in my branch did not know the facts either way. I sent a follow up mail and they have not been the same since then. I still can't get the $10m transferred out of the bank. I am requesting your assistance as the person who will act as the new owner of the fund. I am telling you this because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and ethics here in South Africa does not allow such funds to stay more than 3 years without claim. I don't know this person personally, but I am convinced that you will be able to render this assistance to me as it will be in the interest of both of us. I will give you more details on request. I still need your assurance to enable me make this transfer. Now what I want from you is for you to stand as the new owner of the fund. If you are willing to assist, contact me immediately through my e mail box. Please, call me on my private telephone number: (00226-7885 7598) so that I will give you more details on the details of this business. If you are not willing, then respect the integrity of this transaction and respect the legal rights of both of us equally. At this juncture, it is my duty to introduce myself as I trust that you will honour me by responding as soon as possible. I pray for your understanding. Please call me on my private telephone number 00226 7818 7598 when you receive this letter. Respectfully yours, Mr.Ibrahim Abi

From:                               RE: TRANSFER OF US$29.8Million To Your Account.                                 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir, I am Mr.Peter B.Holland, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining and Natural Resources. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, MR.ANDRE P. WILKINS made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$29.8 Million, in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation Ltd that MR.ANDRE P. WILKINS died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR.ANDRE P. WILKINS did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$29.8 Million is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to South Africa law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to MR.ANDRE P. WILKINS so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to:jaig@caramail.com All I need from you is to send to my bank immediately the following information: 1. YOUR FULL BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER 2. YOUR VINYL FILLING NUMBER 3. YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS AND FAX NUMBERS 4. YOUR FAX AND TELEPHONE DELETIONS 5. YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER AND PHONE NUMBER 6. YOUR TEL and FAX NUMBERS AND ACCOUNT NUMBER.  Upon your response, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application that you will send to the bank.

Title: Urgent
 Urgent ATTN: The President/CEO I am Mr. Rao Jahangiri, the Bank Manager in prime bank city  of Johannesburg  South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$4,500,000.00(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation  that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.                           This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is now the debt owed to the South Africa Mining Corporation by my late employer.                   I have since then made another investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.                   This is the reason why I am writing you today.

I have since arranged for the money to be recalled to your account from the South Africa Mining Corporation here in Johannesburg  South Africa by one of the local bussiness lobbies. However, I will give you more details of the arrangment when I hear from you. I hope to conclude this business within fourteen (14) working days if you are going to be of assistance.

Title: From Richard Hayter
 From Richard Hayter ATTN: Sir/Madam. I hope this may not constitute sort of embarrassment to you but I am afraid this letter might come to you as a surprise. I am Mr.Richard Hayter, a native of Johannesburg, South Africa and i am an Executive Accountant with the South African department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars. which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South African civil service and political system (of which I am a part) makes it very difficult for us to transfer this amount of money overseas for legitimate business investment. This amount (US$18,500,000.00) represents the balance of the total revenue collections for the last fiscal (three-four) years in which the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources was in operation. It also includes commissions and other expenses that were incured in the course of the transaction.    The amount in question is not an illegal money, as all necessary procedures have been followed in the course of executing this transaction. The payment is in respect of a contract awarded by us to a foreign company/individual and executed for the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. This amount (US$18,500,000.00) is the revenue of the contract awarded by us and we are happy with the balance of $19,500,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) which we received from the foreign company/individual. However, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South African civil service and political system (of which I am a part) makes it very difficult to transfer this amount of money abroad for legitimate business investment. This is the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my aid and please God  bless you and your family. In fact, we could have executed this deal alone but because of my sensitive position in the South African Government, we were prevented from doing so. I will explain my reasons for contacting you. Firstly, I have a confidential business proposition for you.   Secondly, I have a proposal for a US$3,500,000.00 per person, per hour business proposal. 3,500,000.00 US Dollars per hour. I want you to consider this proposal seriously as it concerns your own business in the area of finance. I work for the Ministry of Finance and account officer to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in South Africa. He was a top executive at one of the prime banks here in the South African  capital city, and my department has been successful in detecting Money Laundering. We have in our possession as overdue invoice from his bank for payment but we cannot do so until he has died or until we receive the next of kin or relation of the deceased for the claim. I am the Account officer to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in South Africa and had vast business interest in Zimbabwe. He died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000. Since the death of the Immigrant property magnate, the Zimbabwe government has been evicted his family members and some local farmers were threatened and some farmers were killed. It is because of these reasons that many people in Zimbabwe have deserted the Government and joined the agrarian rebels. The President of the Zimbabwean section of the Farmers Union (UG) Mr. Kenneth M.M.M.M.M.  (aka Eze E.B)  deserted the political party line and demanded that all government officials be paid Full Shakedown Fees from the Farmers Union (UG) of which my head office are not aware since they were run by sympathizers of the President and his family. Mr. Eze E.B No longer exists in my office because I had him all to myself and run my entire bank now in my Bank. This money  I have in my office now is the /5,000,000,000,

Title: URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM.
 URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM. OFFSHORE ZONE. BORG 1-11 JOHANNESBURG,BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I hope to conclude this business transaction that will benefit both of us. I am Mr. pavid omar, the external auditor general in the International Commercial Bank of BURKINA FASO  (C.I.B)  where I am based. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an over 69,000 ton Bombardment aircraft, filled with arms and ammunition, crashed into my bank in the capital city of Burkina faso, causing the death of my clients. Among the dead were the manager of the bank and his entire family, including his wife and only daughter. After the death of my clients, I ordered an inquiry to find out anything about them, and I sent a routine notification to them, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from the bank that my clients and their bank accounts had been seized by the government of Burkina faso  before my clients body was moved. I demanded that the bank release the account to me because it had been seized by the government before. The bank complied to the request and the balance was transferred to my account without  any claim of the funds in the account. Is this not enough for you? I will pay the balance of US$26.5 million (Twenty-six million Five Hundredthousand United State Dollars) to any bank account where my clients  can be proven to have deposited the funds,  according to the law here, as a bonus, to cover any over-invoiced amount that might be incurred by the bank during the course of transaction. So, if you are willing to assist me in this business, kindly contact me through email, as soon as you  have received this letter. Please, treat from me with the utmost attention, trust and confidence, and rest assured that I will be most grateful if you could receive this fund into your account, for which you will also give us a very good rate of return. Please, if you are ready, contact me immediately with these email addresses1@o1.com and 1@o2.com, to enable us discuss the modalities for seeing this transaction through. Regards, Mr pavid omar. -- Original Message -- "REMITTANCE OF $14.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"

 CONFIDENTIAL ATTN:PERFORMING OFFICER ATTN:Director GENERAL/CEO. The Head of the Bank: The bank is where I keep my safe deposit of  United State Dollar Billions.  The bank account is here: (no. 10, main branch) in:  Langkawi Klang Koh Samui East  Kabang, Koh Samui. Koh Samui. Koh Samui. 12 years. I know this email will reach you as a surprise but I am interested  in your business proposition.We want to start a business with you.I got your contact from Yahoo tourist  and this is the reason for this mail. On the date when my father died,  he took us to Bangkok, Thailand and was  poisoned by his own family members.On further investigation, I found out that he  died without having any next of kin and I am afraid. He  planned to cash in this business on the last day of  his life, so I decided to inform you about this  business. Secondly, he left the sum of fifty four million  United State Dollar Billions in a fixed account in one of the prime bank  here in Koh Samui. I plan to capitalize on this money and invest it with my own  hands in a profitable business. However,  I don't know any one here. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this  money can not be approved to a local person here. I don't  want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and order here in Koh Samui  is very strict and this request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Koh Samui Citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In  consideration of this, I will like you to act as next of kin to my late  father. In law, as long as you are a foreigner, you are allowed to open a local bank account  here in Koh Samui without documents. I will gladly give you the letter of  the acceptance to open a bank account and/or to provide address for  the account to be opened. Please, I need your cooperation to complete this  transaction. If you are willing, kindly contact me through email. the email  address below and I will send you more details on how we plan to actualize this  transaction.Please, reply me on this email address   phillips_cmx@yahoo.co.uk  Best regards, Mr.Chinonsa Lamptey.

Yes ma'am. I have a proposal for  you. On July 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the British Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Patrick Gallagher made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 20,000,000.00pds,in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the British Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Patrick Gallagher died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Patrick Gallagher  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of $20,000,000.00pds is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Laws, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Patrick Gallagher so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are willing to assist us, kindly get back to me by sending an email to:nicholas_kabub@yahoo.com  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

I am Mr.Morris Thompson, a native of Cotonou, Republic of the Cotonou, Republic of the Cotonou Province of West Africa, with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you for a business relationship that will be of a mutual benefit to both of us.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $20 Million US Dollars (Twenty Million US Dollar) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with many other people in EgyptAir Flight 990 Airways flight #271 (for more information about Flight #271 you can go to the link below and contact you directly. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/02/egyptair.air/index.html The account was opened in the name of Mr. Morris Thompson who is now deceased.This account was opened in an account number that was supplied to us by a customer who died alongside with his entire family in the plane crash of 24-SEVEN  Boeing 767(, MSN Flightsim)prospective Flight 990(an Alaskan Airlines Flight 990)linerliner which crashed on January 26, 2000, SEVERAL MILLION  AMERICAN DOLLARS) in the air at Doha-Cote d'Ivoire from the capital city DohaState (Maldives) with other passengers on board.  The flight was on a test flight to Alaska.  The owner of this account is Mr. Samuel Kim, an American, a scientist and a resident of Doha-Cote d'Ivoire, in north Africa, with a deposit valued at US$20,000,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred American Dollars) deposited in a banking security company here in the United Kingdom.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as a next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials at the security company now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasure as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here in the bank stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my men.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$19,900,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you nominated account overseas. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following to enable me start the processing the transfer, 1.Your Full Name. 2.Your House Address. 3.Your Phone Number and Fax, Thank You And God Bless You.

Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (USD28,500, 000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$628.5 million USD) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount.We the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

Title: SUMO BENEFICIARY.
 SUMO BENEFICIARY. Dear Sir, My name is Mr CARLOS Juma Masjid, I employed you in my office as a foreign contract   examiner for the oil companies. I was his  accountant and from my office I was able to procure the following information.  1. Total number of crude and    heavy oil barrels   paid for each year.  2. Total number of tankers filled with petroleum products paid for each   year.  3. Total number of money orders, draft bills, electronic money and traveler's cheques.  4. Total number of contracts awarded by my   board of commissioners, which includes the oil company.  5. Total number of foreign visitors to my office during last year.  6. Total number of contracts awarded by my   board of commissioners, which includes the oil company.  7. Total number of foreign prescription drugs imported into my office, which includes   prescription drugs for heart patients.  8. Total number of foreign visitors to my office during last year.  9. Total number of foreign contract workers, which includes foreign and   local contract workers.  10. Total number of foreign customer service officers and their families.  11. Total number of foreign contractors who executed contracts I awarded to   the South African Companies - B.R.A.  12. Total number of foreign customers who paid me for contracts I have to deliver to   them.  13. Total number of foreigners who came to my office for the compensation. The present government of President Jonas Savimbi    has seized all our bank accounts, including my account here in South Africa.   They are not relenting on their effort to make us poor again, so that is why I decided to remove this fund   from my account under my care.  The reason is because I retired from service after a   year of hard labor and I need a fellow to work the pension accounts.  Now my next best hope is that my retirement will secure    for us   a    good   pensioner who will work   for us in his or her spare time while I shall then come over to your country for   sharing of the fund.  I am willing to give   you 20% if you are willing to work with us. I will be your   immediate and    reliable reminder    when this fund is finally   transferred    into your account, which you shall also apply to the pension fund   for   onward transfer of the fund into your   account.

On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, Mr. Paul Richard made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at £25,000, 000.00 pence pence (Twenty Five Million Pence) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers in the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company that Mr. Paul Richard died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Richard did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of £25,000, 000.00 pence is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Dutch Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Richard so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. I will pay into your account immediately you finalise this transaction. If you are willing, please forward to me the following information: 1. Your company name. 2. Your address. 3. Your phone number. 4. Your age. I will let you know the course to follow in order to a sure spot of success. Send me your full name, address, and phone number immediately you receive this email. Thanks for your cooperation. Best Regards, Mr.Paul Richard.  The manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of E.P.C.   ****** N/B:If you are interested in this project, kindly enclose your bank information, including your private number including mobile number, for easy and urgent communication. ******  The manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of E.P.C  ****** Sincerely, Mr. Paul Richard  ****** Replies to:paul_richard@holapuravida.com  ******

 Consulted on ATTN:Sir, I am gilmazelle@turbonett.com I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry through this bold and risky idea. On June 6, 2000, an America oil consultant/contractor with Chevron ... made a numbered time (fixed) deposit in my branch in the amount of US$100,000,000.00 (Twenty-Four million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) that the US$100,000,000.00 deposit was a hoax and a scam. I sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the KPC that the US$100,000,000.00 deposit was a hoax and a scam. We destroyed all his documents, including his bank account and eventually recovered his bank's records.  Now he has been able to repair some of his damaged accounts but these are crude accounts that cannot sustain such a large sum of money.  I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in Kuwait,after we concluded our search in the world.I am Mr.gilmazelle@turbonett.com, a member of the KPC Contract Review Panel.I have mapped out the deposit made by the American in my bank and I will be grateful if you could assist in forwarding the money to his designated bank account. I want you to send immediately to me via my private email address: (gilmazelle@turbonett.com) if you are willing to render this assistance to me. I am ready to approve this transfer to any foreign bank account where this money is transferd to. All I want is for you to send me your bank account information for easy and safe tracking of this money. I will be grateful if you could get me to provide a forwarding address for this money to be forwarded to. In the mean time, I will like you to keep this very important information to yourself because of the sensitive nature of my work. Thank you for your anticipated and urgent reply.

I am Jules Bellah, the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in South Africa.I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that would be of much benefit to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. it is because of the difficult time we are having to the get around to claiming this money and we are handicapped in the circumstances. We are not allowed to operate a foreign account and as such, I have decided to divert this money for now and transfer this money to a foreign account for safety and security reasons. and also to be able to claim this money when it is transferred abroad. The amount involved is (USD23M) Twenty three million United States Dollars only. I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist.I want to first transfer USD23M from this money into a safe foreign account where it can be easily transferred to. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Bart Jansen is a foreigner too, and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together. I got your contact address from the girl who operates computer. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private phone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. Because the arrangement is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down. with my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account.

I have a rather urgent and confidential contact in my department which I want to begin by introducing myself. I am SOCHYD JOHANUM. a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the  South Africa department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me so that I can start the process of  receiving your approval/approval letter for the transaction to your account from the relevant ministries/Federal  ministries concerned. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within  the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and  with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling  Fourty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($450,000.000.) which we want to  transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign  company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign  company/individual to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil  Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the  whole transaction. This amount (US$45.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value

I am MR Kofi Amode, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be inform that the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, Governmental Affairs, and Mining Revenues approved the receipt in my department of your e-mail address as a result of a routine verification. Unfortunately, my chain of command and/or rank in the department does not always view this transaction as something  worthy of confidence. This resulted in me being nominated by the South Africa Mining Corporation (MMC) to work out engineering and contract award contracts with the South Africa Mining Development Corporation. I shall not go into too much detail about this transaction, as it relates to our company's confidential product certification program, as we are still in active investigation and regulatory compliance as the result of a number of kinks in the original award. However, I have secured approval to send you  a cheque for the sum of (USD$9,000,000.00) Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,700,000.00) from the South Africa Mining Corporation Central Account as a commission. I will be transferring this fund to your account with this bank in South Africa, as the beneficiary of the commission, and for our own personal use as we intend to invest in your country under your guidance. Be inform that the Central Account is a secured account, and will remain so till we agree upon a time after which time it will be opened to remit this money to any other account nominated by the Central Account holder. Be inform that the remittance is subject to these terms and you will be expected to honor all the conditions hereunder for our onward sharing in your country. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential.

From: MR.TAHD O.BAH, THE CHIEF AUDITOR. OKLAHOMA BANK. OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I am Mr.Tadhkabah the chief auditor of the store in which I work as the chief auditor of the bank here in Burkina faso. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 8, 2000, a gold merchant/contractor with the State owned gold corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,000,000.00(Four Million US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, gold corporation that Mr Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Burkinabe Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Burkinabe Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 20% for me and 60% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Title: I NEED YOUR HELP
 I NEED YOUR HELP ATTN. DIRECTOR/CEO. For reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that will be of mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the  transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer  who died along with his entire family on the 21ST october, 2000 in a plane crash, leaving no  beneficiary to the account and nobody knows about this account either from the  government or  the previous government. His next of kin was his first  of kin and he was the sole provider of the money for the  entire family and I am the director in charge of accounts. On further  investigation, my officers found out that the dead person was a foreigner and  his only daughter is a Republic of Korea citizen. Considering our  situation from the last time of 70,000 refugees who died  along with their families, I decided to bury them under the cover of night and withdraw  the money from the bank,  before we move on with the business of our lives.  I discovered a deposit of the money in the bank  treasury account as a memorial  of the dead and I have since  taken the decision to move on with my life. In the meantime, I  kept this information secret within myself and  company for now until I decided to make this move  on behalf of my colleagues and myself as we  cannot invest this money in South Korea. The Bank  will be in charge of this fund for us  and we will share the money in the ratio of  60% for the Bank and 40% for the rest of the people  on the staff and I.  Upon the receipt of this mail, I will inform you of  the next step to take and for your support, you should contact me  on my number 00226-7885 75 97 before  you give me your private telephone and fax number.

 Account Update From: Mr. Joseph Kony Fax: 2487-7885-9090 [redmond, sedam] Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr. Joseph Kony, Bank Manager of the Jubilee Branch of the Bank of Southern Sudan, Abidjan-Sensa where I am based. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$33,500,000.00 (33,500,000.00 USD) on behalf of my branch in my branch. Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had actively opposed the Government of his country, South Sudan and is therefore no longer factor in the transaction. This sum of US$35,500,000.00  is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Sudan, at the expiration of(Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Sudan government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

Having heard from some trusted persons that you are able to handle outstanding amount of money, I decided to contact you due to my need for assistance and the need to trust you as a person who is capable of handling such amount of money. I am Mr. Hoffman Obum, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant account with a foreign bank in Africa, I contacted the manager of the bank and we worked out the modalities to put you in place as the next of kin. On the routine file of the file, I discovered that there was a settlement of the money in this account and I immediately put a hold on the payment to avoid the account being used to solicit for donations in Kenya and abroad. I and my bank officials now find ourselves in a bind as to how to get out this money without breaching the bank rules against bank foreign account establishment. In the hope of finding some partner who will be capable and fit to act as the next of kin, I changed my plans and decided to write to you for a great business relationship. On this discovery, I decided to solicit for your assistance to execute this transaction with you. On further investigation, I found out that you do not operate a bank account but a private account and I fixed a bank account for the future use of both of us. And you have no knowledge of this transaction. I now seek your consent to present you as the beneficiary of this money, so that we can remit this money to any foreign bank account you will provide, as it will be in your interest to do so as there is no risk involved in this transaction. I have laid all the solemn trust in you before I leave the room. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business.You are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business. If you are ready, please get back to me immediately through this email ishon:hoffman_obum@yahoo.com wishing to express your interest. Thank you and God bless. Sincerely, Mr. Hoffman Obum.

My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in my hometown, but unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 turboprop aircraft which crashed on January 31 2000, flying at Kitty Hawk high rate air base, Cotonou Republic Boure.The name of my father's business which was destroyed in the crash is KMCT/SENEGAL/Lagos-Cotonou-Delta International Airport.The name of this airport is in my family, in fact my father named this airport after him.I am married to a wealthy chocolate merchant who died with his entire family on January 31 2000 in the plane crash. Before his death, he entrusted my late husband to my brothers and me to find a new next-of-kin for my father's business who died in the plane crash.And according to our former master's will, if my late father has any next-of-kin, it is for the deposit of this money in this bank till further orders of this bank.As it is said, the will, papers of deposit in this bank was found lying in the bank treasury when my late father was alive and he entrusted my late husband to me to look for a new next-of-kin to represent this money in this bank and he did not disclose the will, the reason for which I was obliged to seek a foreign partner for this transaction. The said owner was a foreigner and a foreigner is not entitled to inherit the fund, so this is the reason why I sought for a foreign partner and this is the reason why we are in this country.My dear, I am Miss LUCIDOU Lou, a native of Cotonou, but settling in Abidjan for the future safety of my children.

 Greetings From Professor Leah Sarr                                                                                         STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Dear sir, I am Professor Leah Sarr, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the  South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($8,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said  fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $8.5m represents the balance of the total revenue collections from oil sales which was in the tune of $31.5 million for the Government of South Africa in the year ending 31 July, 2001, While the balance of the revenue derived from fuel sales which was in the tune of $35.5 million for the Government of South Africa in the year ending 31 March, 2004. This amount was accrued from over-invoiced contracts awarded by the Government for the past contract period. The amount in the balance account is secured with the help of a Bank Collection. I got your contact through my personal search to see if you could assist this funds would be transferred abroad for onward investment on behalf of me by the bank. At the suggestion of your contact, I will give you 30% of the total sum while 5% will be set aside for expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process and the remaining 65% would be for me. Please, I need your support, because the accountant will not renew his/her contract and if I don't remit this money out immediately.  I will come to your country with my wife and kids for settling and for a comfortable life. I am ready to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance during this transaction. I have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum to encourage you to please contact me immediately through my above email. We will send to you a statement of the transaction, which you will forward to the bank, claiming the said account as the abode of your fathers dreams. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for the proper sharing of the fund according to the percentages indicated. At this juncture, you should contact me on this email XXXXXxxxxxx@yahoo.es or call me on this email   zoe_bear@zwallet.com Regards, Professor Leah Sarr

Title: Confidential
 Confidential Attn: The President/Director. I have a very urgent and  confidential business / project suggestion for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation, late Mr. David Cole made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued GBP12,500, 000.00(Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand)pounds in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Cole died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Cole did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of GBP12,500, 000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6 (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Macedonian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Cole so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the lawyer and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr Robert Miller Email:robertmiller9@netscape.net Thanks and regards. Mr Robert Miller

Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT RESPONSE      Dear Sir/Madam, I am Musa A. Abubakar, the Auditor General in account management section in the Bank of Africa (or any bank of your choice) I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$19,500,000.00(Twenty-six Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Phillip Morris died in the Plane Crash On July 25th, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it from the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$19,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it hence the money is being kept in my bank until it is time to be paid out to the next of kin or to be donated to a church or religious organization of our choice. Now, in view of this, I decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Mr.Phillip Morris. However, I don't know any of his family and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Ghana stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Ghana citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 30% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 50% would be for me . There is no risk at all as the procedures for claiming this funds will be explained to you as soon as you indicate your interest . The fee for this transaction is US$9,800,000.00 which I will give to you upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank for now till I confirm your credit/investigation report in your bank and also send a copy of this mail to you for your approval. Yours faithfully, Musa A. Abubakar  TEL: 00226 76 76 77 91 ______________________________________ Platíte zbyteáli 20 septempo telesíti, mce i cenu! http://net.tel.gl/0,2187434.0 OSENJI MCE.

Title: It's a Wonderful Life    Hello Dear,   This mail is intended for Mr.John May, a citizen of Zimbabwe, but I want to   invite you to investigate it serious and I hope that you will   consider this as a very confidential matter.   I am Mr. John M. May, a citizen of Zimbabwe, During the current crises against the farmers in Zimbabwe from President Robert Mugabe   and his men, more so, the president ordered all white farmers to surrender all farms to his party members and their followers.   My father was one of the most successful multy farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe`s ideas, Mugabes supporters invaded his farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing him and made away with a lot of farming items in my fathers farm.   Before his death, my father had deposited with banking   firm the sum of USD$12.5 million ($12.5 million USD) in a bank here in santorini island.    This money has been unclaimed since 2003 and till date no bank has ever named any of his affiliated companies, nor has there been any of his related business relation available to (my father) for this amount of money to be released.    I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways: (1) To provide a bank account where this money will be transfered into; (2) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am a Baka (not   citizen of country).   Furthermore, I am willing to offer you 10% of the total sum as compensation for your efforts/input after the successful transfer of this fund into your nominated account overseas.   Furthermore, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as I believe that this transaction would be concluded within fourteen (14) working days you signify interest to assist me.   Please, contact me immediately through my email, if you are interested in this project.   And please be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free and precisely as a matter of urgency we must both send in a live stream of our conversation to your e-mail address below so that we can forward appropriate documents, such as the bank account information, to enable us claim this fund on behalf of our respective banks.   Please kindly email me immediately for urgent reply.   Yours Faithfully,   Mr.John M. May      el_rebeld_2005@yahoo.co.com.uy

After a  year, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Charles Williams died in an auto-mobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without giving any  next of kin or relations, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Williams  did not declare any next of kin or relations in his official papers, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$11,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Singapore Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your phone number and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you the account of your choice.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you the account of your choice.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you the account of your choice.  Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the will.  I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100%risk free and 100%risk free activity.   RESPONSE MUST BE MADE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE FUND GET INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.    ATTENTION: DIRECTOR/CEO/CEO: CONTACT :                                                       PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL      &amp; YOURs

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE
 URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE ATTN.Sir/Madam. I am a director with the International Commercial Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa. Am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank here in South Africa who died in plane crash along with his entire family on the 1st Oct.2001 in an EgyptAir Boeing 747 Flight 990. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the money in our bank without his permission. But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin and related person to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in South Africa is that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your�s faithfully, MR.TAMES JMORRIST

 RE: TRANSFER OF US$14.5,000.000.00 ONLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT DIRECTOR: PROFESSOR MATT ABOH After careful consideration, I decided to contact you over this financial transaction worth the sum of US$14.5Million which I believe we can accomplish legally in your jurisdiction. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in Nigeria, when I was searching for a partner that will assist me.My name is Dr.Tom Ojimvu, a member of the Nigerian Chambers of Commerce and Industrialism. I am an Executive Director to the MUGFKM Parliamentary Group on Mining &amp; Natural Resources. The group supervises and coordinates the budgetary activities of the House of Lords, which covers the parastatals, as well as the House of Assembly. Myself and other partners in the group are concerned about the air quality in our parastatals which has become an embarrassment to our government. I have been nominated by our chamber of commerce to be the next of kin to the late ZIMMERY ZIMBAG. The matter is very confidential and top secret between myself and my partners. Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and to enable us present our business as in a legal and respectable manner, so that you will be able to act accordingly on your part as the next of kin to the late ZIMMERY ZIMBAG. I will introduce a very good lawyer to help us out as the attorney as my client died without a kin or heir hence the need for a foreigner to fill this role. My client was an important business man who died without heir or next of kin hence the need for a foreigner to act as his next of kin and receive his fees. There was no heir apparent so that is the reason why I and my partners in the group are seeking for your assistance as the next of kin to late ZIMMERY ZIMBAG. Note that you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum, 60% will be for us, while 10% will be set aside for expenses both parties might incure during the time of transfer and also to minimise any chance of tax dodging by either party during the transfer process. Further Information about the transfer will be given to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingnesse. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this transaction. Yours faithfully, Dr. Tom Ojimvu.

From: Sir,  I am writing in respect of an unconscribed sum of  US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) of which my  boss at the bank I work with, Mr. Alan Davies, has secretly deposited the sum of  US$20,000,000.00(Twenty Million Dollars) in the bank  Printer's   Shop in the city  here in South Africa?I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his  money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or  relation to the depositor as indicated in our banking guidelines but  unfortunately  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.                  Unfortunately, due to the lapse of time it is impossible for him to maintain  the account since none of the usual suspects has come up for the claim  and now the bank is being used as a ***  bank                      Hence  my asking for your support and co-operation to carry out this business deal,  which is why I wanted you to update me  as soon as possible on your next of kin or relation so that we can plant the  bait and start the  transfer                                                                                                          You are  required by the bank to furnish your full and complete  information, including your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication   with the other party. I have made all the necessary enquiries   on my personal check list to locate any of his  nearest and connected bank accounts but to no success   hence  the need for a foreign  partner.                           SO  I have decided to contact you for  this  transaction,          You are then   contacted to provide either an existing bank account  or to set up a new bank a/c immediately to receive  this   money                                                   and to make  all transfer   necessary    documents which will be used to back up  the   claim.   I  have set aside 15% of the total amount for all kinds of expenses incurred during the       expenses    incurred during   this  transaction,    In summary, 30% for you, 60% for I and the remaining 10% for the   miscelleneous expenses incurred during the      transaction.      I am  willing to  give you 20% of the total amount for your kind attention, I will gladly  give you more details    upon  your positive response. Please, get in touch with me through my above email   for  more firm    and  details.     Best regards,   Yours faithfully,  Mr.Mohammed Abacha.

From: BLESSED BARRISTER MRS MOSES ABACHA. Dear Friend. I have a urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Engr. Chris Williams, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00(Fourteen Million five hundred thousand dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr. Chris Williams died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Chris Williams did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me to transfer this money to a foreign account because the money is secured there and I don't want it to get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and 35% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Yours faithfully, BLESSED BARRISTER MRS MOSES ABACHA. Email:blessed@zwallet.com                  Email: moses_fd@zwallet.co.uk

FRIEND,Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you.I got your contact from a temple where I studied for years and was inspired by your example to seek assistance from outside for this project. I have a proposal for your consideration. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Shell Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000,00US dollars(twenty five million dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Shell Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died of an automobile accident .On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempt to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000,00US dollars is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the International Money Laundering Directive, I and my Bank Director are now considering taking legal action to enforce this money throughout the entire echelon of the Bank as we have been advised that a Nepali or Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. By virtue of my position as Bank Director, I cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner no matter how much money he made and still no one will come forward to claim it.  We are now in negotiations with the bank about the best way to move this money around the bank. The amount being involved is however, in the realm of possibility and can be changed at any time to suit our own interest. I have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum as compensation for your initiative while the remaining 70% for us will be for me and my family, as I will need your assistance to invest in your country. If you are willing to assist me, kindly get back to me via this email address .Please get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks for your understanding and remain blessed as I wait for your urgent response.  Best regards   MRS.ollie kone

From:      My father  was on the payroll of a gold  consortium that owns and operates factories in Africa. He was a shop owner in Burkina Faso where he was murdered by the rebel(THE FAR EAST ALAS) forces who were assasinated during the civil war in my country.   He  was a member  of  the Supreme Council of Bakar  Tambure  who is also  the director of Digitalization and IT at the  Ministries of  President  Olusegun Obasanjo.

Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($26,500,000.00) which we want to front in a foreign bank account for our share in good faith, but we can't transfer it in to any account because of the stand-off/dispute in the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where the amount is presently being  approved /repaid. Hence, our method of making this transfer is by Land Bank (SAB) to South Africa where the funds is to be transferred. The amount involved is Twenty -Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar($26.5m). Thi amount is being paid to a Foreigner and his account is being audited and  audit reports are being sent to us because of our standing as civil servants in our country. I have agreed to turn the balance of the amount $24,500,000.00 ($24,500,000.00) which is the balance of the amount being paid into our Bank Account abroad in the name of Mr. Ahmad Yousef,  the foreign contractor (to be paid in claim of our bank account) of my bank where the rest of the money will be transfered into for our share.

Since we cannot release the money to our foreign customers relatives hence the name of our department is coming out as the cause of the funds being held in this account.

I am not making a deal; i am telling you to stand down, as the contractor was a foreigner and my client was a local person here in the country. On the day of the commencement of the contract, the prime contractor left the ministry and travelled to Dubai. On his arrival, he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00 US dollars(Fifteen Million Dollars) in a bank here in the country.  On acceptance, the bank gave him a certificate of Deposit and settlement, which he signed and submitted to the government of the arabia.    After this, he deposited the money in another bank here in the country. This money was part of the total sum ordered to be paid to the prime contractor for the contract work done for the past years by the Ministry of Oil.

Title: Assistance From Nelson Abia
 Assistance From Nelson Abia Tel: +234-80-234-7878 73 na 18/11/2004 Ja. P.A.C ...................  CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir/Madam, I am from Botswana and working with the South Africa branch of the International Commercial Hotel Association.I am writing this letter because it is the only way I can connect with my family for financial assistance. South Africa  is experiencing a severe food and energy crisis. The North-Africa group of nations is currently facing a food and energy crisis.  My country has many resources in abundance in abundance of oil, diamonds, wood and minerals but cannot meet the food and energy needs of a nation facing a food and energy shortage.  The South Africa branch of the International Commercial Hotel Association is currently in need of foreign family members who will be capable to provide both food and energy for the next of kin of the International Commercial Hotel Association owner who was recently killed by a group of up to 5 gunmen. The owner of this company was killed by a private security company in Johannesburg South Africa for security reasons. As an association we are not allowed to operate any bank account and if he had a private bank account he would have fled the country as soon as the government got wind of this.  So my family is currently living on borrowed funds from the International Commercial Hotel Association and my father was able to secure some funds in South Africa through the help of some respected black business men who advised him on how to move the funds out of the country.  And some of my father's business associates also helped him arrange for a Motor Car and Some fast Travel to South Africa through a reliable partner who died along side with my father.  We are not sure how our father died but we are certain that the funds in South Africa is not safe anymore for investment and we need your assistance to get it back to where it came from before it was diverted by the government of South Africa.  The South Africa government has slapped import restrictions on the family and the family cannot move any of my father's assets outside the country at this time because of the current political crisis in South Africa.  My father had deposited the sum of US$33.35M (Thirty Three Million Dollars) in one bank account in South Africa and deposited the remainder of the funds in another bank account.  He told me about the funds in the accounts when he died and I decided to contact any reliable person in the bank who can assist us to transfer this money to a foreign account for safety and security reasons.  I am the only son of Nelson Abia and my father was a well known farmer and his family engaged in forest and farm products business in my country.  Before his death he told me that if I do not remit this money immediately that he will call the police and claim as the next of kin all the foreign farm products that he has dumped in the banks treasury because the bank has frozen all his accounts in my country including his.

Title: Urgent BUSINESS CRIMES
 Urgent BUSINESS CRIMES Good day, I am Titus James Morris, a bank official in the bank of Africa(BOUGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO). In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$12.2Million [Twelve Million two hundred and Twenty two million two hundred and twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two thousand two hundred and Twenty two thousand two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two hundred and Twenty two thousand Two  because of fiduciary value attached to the account.  The owner of this account is Mr. Solomon  Tobago, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died,  on the 21ST JULY, 2000 in a plane crash, having orbited-sailed from DAKAR SENEGAL to EBOLA,  flying at the co-pilot's of one of the foreign passenger airlines.  My colleague and I have been delegated by the president of the bank of Africa (BOUGADOUGOUBURKINA FASO)  towards the establishment of a transaction/business between two foreign depositors(Mr. Solomon  Tobago and I) who is domiciled in our bank and is  a contractor with the federal government of my country (Burkina Faso).  We are the only two beneficiaries of the said amount and we are both  citizens of the same country, so the whole concept of a  foreign account is not in our bank's legal books, because we are a  Burkinabe country.  As such, we are in a bind because we are both foreigners.   We are, therefore, in need of a foreign account for this money to be  transferred abroad.   We have agreed to share the money  and a bank account should be acquired.   We are willing to give a very generous share of 25% of the  total sum for your kind assistance.   The need for the account is urgent and the business itself is 100% risk free.   The account is in a bank here in Burkina Faso, and my colleague  has agreed to come  over to our country to seek for political asylum,  therefore, our bank has called me to come over to your country to arrange  for a business visa for you so that you can  apply for the transaction visa, however, we agree that 45% of the  total sum will be set aside for the  expenses that might be incurred in the course of the transaction,  however, mentally ill person with dementia may require such person not.   We are willing to give you as little as 10% of the total sum for your kind assistance.   Please, let me know if you  can come over to my country for the  investment.   If you are willing to assist us, kindly send me an email: tjmorg@mail2world.com Yours faithfully, T. J. Morris

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ian Bell did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of £12,500,000.00pds is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Ian Bell so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you.

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18,500,000) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous fees. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or my e-mail address: jamesoveg123@yahoo.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours faithfully, Mr. Oliver Taylor

Title: you are being worn down by this especial problem now
 you are being worn down by this especial problem now Dear friend, I am sincerely trying to reach you for a transaction that will benefit both of us. My husband    (ABDUL) has a business proposal for  you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil sale was held in Abidjan, the   capital city of Ivory coast. During this oil sale, a number of well known and well paid foreign  contractors worked on projects for the government, some of them are Egyptians, some are South Africans,  some are from Britain, some are from China, and some are from South America. During the  oil sale, many projects were awarded contracts worth millions of dollars, and over the high counters , the over invoiced contractors  were sent packing. During this oil sale, some subcontractors were paid their entitlements and over invoiced them,  resulting in the loss of some projects and the over invoiced contractors. You will read in the papers about it, but unfortunately you do not  have this information in your bank account which he mentioned. Now that the contracts for the purchase of new military police motorbikes and DC trucks  have been awarded by the federal government, and the old orders of the mayors have been lifted, you will find that the old contracts are being honored. I want you to help us transfer the money(US$20.5 million) into your account, so that we can share the money  profitably between us.The plan is that 30% for you, 60% for us and 10% set aside for expenses  incured during the business . The bank account you will provide will be used to back up your claim against us. What I want from you now is to arrange to see your account in a few days, so that the money  will be transferred into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 10% for Expenses incured during the business .There is no risk at all if you agree to my offer. I will give you more details to you as soon as I  hear from you. Be rest assured that I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated. Yours Faithfully,  Mrs.Ellie Anthony.

From:  Mr. Mohammad Ayub "Moses."  I am Mr. Mohammed Ayub, the bank manager of Development Bank of Mauritius(D.O.C.) on account of my colleagues who were victims of Maurice Blackburn's gold  strike parties in our bank.On a seasonally adjusted basis, I decided to compensate the victims by offering a bank,  that has been dormant for an extended period of time, a new loan with a fixed rate of  8% for a fixed period of years. I presented the victims to our bank as mutilated and  cursed beings. On further investigation, I found out that the victims were in fact the  direct beneficiary of the loan, which we had received from the  Government treasury department and I had to compensate them with this.  My proposal was that I would like you as a  foreigner to stand as the beneficiary to the loan. So, for  consideration of your willing cooperation, I have decided to offer you 20% of the  total sum of $13,500,000.00 that we have in our bank for advising and  assisting us.  Upon receipt of your response, I will send to you by fax or email the  application letter, application fee including proof of payment form.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance  to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply.    Mr. Mohammed Ayub.           Reply to: mohmedayub@tiscali.co.uk

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Mr.Mike Wilson. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). Ouagadougou Burkina Faso,Burkina Faso. Dear Friend. I am the manager of bill and exchange at the bank of africa (BOA). I got your address details from the international directory in no time. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business deal I have been expecting your kind attention. I am Mr.Mike Wilson ,B.O.A M.B.I, the manager of bill and exchange at the Banks of africa (BOA). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 9.5 million united states dollars (US$9.5m).In an account that belongs to one of our bill and exchange departmental customers who died in a plane crash in Asian country, on the 26th December 2002. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the decedent for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner bachelors as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of the money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. If you are interested in the proposal, kindly send to me immediately your: 1. Full names and address. 2. Occupation and salary. 3. Date of birth. And finally, I will like you to furnish me with your personal fax and telephone numbers for easy and urgent communication. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not make undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you.and remember that your urgent reactivation is highly necessary .Please, contact me immediately through my above private email address for further details on how we can get this money into your account.You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please, reply me to enable me send to you more informations about this transaction. Regards, mike wilson. Bill and Exchange Manager, Bank of africa (BOA).

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE DELIVERIES DEAR SIR,  I am love child of late Mr.and Mrs.Arthur Mbebe, a man who died with his entire family on December 26,2002 in an aircraft crash at Lahore, Pakistan. I am indebted to you for this information and the purpose of this letter, I am MARTIN ABACHA   from the upper floors of  Bank of Africa, the capital city of Benin in West Africa. I am your  correspondent, account and financial officer. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank  who died with his entire family on December 26,2002 in an aircraft crash.  We were clients of this bank before the crash of the plane  Boeing 767-200 that crashed on December 21,2002 on the way to charge a function  of depositing a foreign customer who died abroad with his entire family.It is from the account where I keep  this unbelievable amount of money.Twenty six million, three hundred and fifty  thousand United States Dollars. The owner of this account is Mr. Arthur Mbebebe, a foreigner. He died in a  plane crash and the account was opened and it is carry on  account to this account for deposit in. The depositor is  most of the depositor is a foreigner, so this account holder is the  origin of the fund, he deposited this amount of money in this bank  as a foreign customer and the depositor is the only  beneficiary of this money.Now, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim  this money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it  as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines. The banking law and guideline here in  Benin stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after some years, it would be  transferred into the treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the  fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Beninese cannot stand as next of  kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my  colleague. The  deal, therefore, is that I will like you to provide immediately your  bank name, address, your personal fax number and personal telephone  number for easy and safe communication and more information will be given to  you as soon as you indicate your preference. I will be monitoring the whole  situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and  ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the  fund according to percentages previously indicated and further  investment, either in your country or any country you may  advice. All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when  I hear from you. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours  Faithfully, Mr. MARTIN ABACHA From: Mrs. Maryam Abacha.

Title: RE: URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. Dear Sir/Madam, I am Fadaka Randebe,Bank of  Africa, Dakar-Senegal. I have an urgent &amp; confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  Shell Petroleum Company, Mr. Jim Smith flew to Dakar-Senegal with a business  transaction valued at US$24 million to attend a meeting on contracts awarded by  the Ministry of Mining and Natural Resources.  During the course of carrying out his duties, he was mandated to  collect a certain amount of money per month from the Central Bank of  Dakar-Senegal for the period of time of his employment.  Upon completion of his appointed duties, he was informed that the  Ministry had ordered the bank to stop issuing receipts for the  monthly payment of this amount for two reasons.  Firstly, because the contract was successful and not for some  reason sanctioned by the bank, and secondly because Mr. Jim  died without making a WILL.  Upon the discovery of this fact, the bank issued to him a  notice to provide a DOLLARS  or be done with care.  As it is said,  aloha,  life is  aloha.  As the bank manager in charge of  bank accounts belonging to foreign companies,  I was made aware of this development, when I was under  a staff of protection  I was informed that there is an account  in the bank belonging to a foreigner who died with his  credit balance in the bank as he died intestate.  All documents pertaining to this account have been forwarded to me by the bank  and I have placed this information in my bank account with the  Bank so that  you will be able to retrieve the money owed to you as  you will not know the full story and context of this deal before you  proceed   with   your everyday  life.  Your urgent response is needed.  Reply to me at: randebe@zwallet.com   Trusting to hear from you.   Please, get in touch with this number  (00229 765 78 99)

ATTN: My name is Mr. Bebhbidi Baba, I worked with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Nigeria, I was a director with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), I was involved in the design and commissioning of a nuclear power plant (NPP) Belize, the subcontracted plant was finished when I was head of commission and I have no command of the English   because the plant is in Nigeria. The plant is about to retire and on strike for 6 months now because of the financial issues. Because of the financial issue, I have been able to procure a good amount of documents and the need for urgent action for the purpose of selling the plant and also for the purpose of acquiring more land for the purpose of intensifying the apartheid regime into a colony of Zimbabwe. The financial information of the plant, My father   whose bank account is in the GNB, account number 8, BELIZE City, Lagos, is a certified goldmine, The account has no account, no beneficiary and until date no other person knows about this account. The account has no other beneficiary and until date no other person knows about this account either from my father or his relatives or . And the account has no other beneficiary. The account has no other beneficiary and until date no other person knows about this account.

Title: Request for Transmittal of this Money
 Request for Transmittal of this Money Dear Sir, I am Mr.B.T. Sherrod, the lawyer to late Mr.M.G.Abella who was an oil merchant /contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the City of Bayola. In the course of our last business outing with our clients, a foreign oil consultant /contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation made a numbered fixed deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million U. S. Dollars) in my chambers. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.M.G.Abella died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.M.G.Abella did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an overseas customer to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.M.G.Abella so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

 FROM: Mr.Chang Jincheng. &gt;From: Mr.Chang Jincheng. Chinese Union Bank Plc. 38,1 - 57 Wilson Street, London. EC2M 2SJ. Dear Friend I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us.A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced youraddress, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with this matter.I am Mr.Chang Jincheng, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department, Chinese Union Bank Plc. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this scheme on behalf of my colleagues at the bank.  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Captain James Oliver made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 25,000,000,00 pounds banknote in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Captain James Oliver died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin or claim his funds was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Captain James Oliver did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of 25,000,000,00 pounds is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  The manager of the bank, who I trusted to appoint a next of kin to claim this money, instead entrusted my department with the task of auditing and accounting for the year 1999.  Now, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Captain James Oliver so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in ANY part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you.(For more details about this transaction, you can contact me immediately through my number 00226-7885 75 99) or through my email address chungjincheng2005@yahoo.co.com Thank you for your prompt response.

(Do not abuse this opportunity or be discouraged) I am (Saif Ali), the Bank manager at the  Scotia  bank in Johannesburg-South Africa.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who died along with  his entire family on the 8th of November, 2004 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my bank  now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to  go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in South Africa is that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this bank is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,inrespect  of the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the  business and 60% would be for me and my woman colleague. If you accept this offer, feel free to let me know as soon as you receive this letter. Thanks and regards Mr Saif Ali. Reply back to Hip Hop Home Page

Last week we held a meeting to discuss the business proposal that   would be of great interest to you  .   I will start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr White, a Manager in   the financial department of Union Bank Of Nigeria, Lome tetna office. I got your contact from   yunhai.com   a web site that   provides reliable and up-to-date information about United States of America.    Please, visit this website: http://www.usaf.com/history/america/britannica.html   If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email   box.    After you, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the   application. Please, be informed that the Foreign Exchange Committee of the   Central bank of Nigeria has given the go-ahead to remit the sum of $9.2m (Nine   Million Two Hundred and Twenty Two Thousand United States   Dollars only, on behalf of the Federal Government and your bank, for the   purpose of accounting and transfer. This amount was accumulated in a Trade   firm in the United Kingdom and we seized it and deposited it in a   bank account belonging to a foreigner here in Nigeria for safe keeping.   The owner of this account is a foreigner and he died without   having any beneficiary to his estate. The request of the owner of this account for a foreign account is occasioned   by the fact that the owner of this account is a foreigner and a mutagouni or no   beneficiary to his estate would be ungrateful and would go against the grain of   the bank. All modalities for the transfer of this money has been worked out .   We have agreed to give you 20% of the total amount for your assistance.   If you agree to my conditions, give me your private number   which I will give to you.   I will also issue you a letter of a authority which will   bind you hand and feet before the money will be remitted in your favour.

This sum of $21.700,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian conventional law, at the expiration of  (seven) years; the money will revert to the ownership of the State Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Anderson so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man(TIM) will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50:50.Please, upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing the fund transfer to your account: 1)Your Full Name- 2)Your House Address- 3)Your Phone Number and Fax Number For more clarification and details,please get in touch with me immediately through my above private email: suzhen_o@yahoo.com Regards, Mohammed Otman.

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. Dear Sir, I am Mr.SOHMED AHMED, the manager in NatWest Bank, allergen free branch in the federal capital territory. It may interest you to know that in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $30,000,000,00 US dollars (Thirty Million U.S.Dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our customer who died along with his entire family on a Concorde flight 990 (an ultra-long-haul passenger airline) that crashed on to the tarmac at King's Cross,  in the financial district of the capital city, United Kingdom. Since we got information about his death,  we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it  unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him  in the crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Nigeria strictly forbids bank to release money to next of kin or relation  because of unclaimed funds for safety and security reasons. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a NIGER cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In appreciation of your assistance, I am willing to give you 15% of the total sum, 70% for your assistance. Please, for security reasons, I will be grateful if you should act as  the next of kin to the deceased customer because the business is risky and risky. At the meeting, my head office decided to give this decision to you, so that you will act as his next of kin and avoid any mis-understanding caused by your not being a citizen of the country. At this meeting, I told you that I will like you to act as his next of kin and address you as such. I want your consent to release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased,  so that you will provide an account for the money to be paid into and clear the bank in your department as the beneficiary.  At this meeting, my head office gave me your contact as of consent to allow me to present you as the next of kin to the deceased. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in my head office, after which, you will be presented for payment to you as the next of kin to the deceased. At this meeting, your share will be 15% of the total sum, 70% for me and my colleagues. I will provide the rest details of the agency. I will also like you to send me your direct telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in my office. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. Thanks for your co-operation. Best regards, Mr. SOHMED AHMED

From: John Williams Tel: +4470401068551 Fax: +4470401068551 Dear Sir, I am JOHN O. WILLIAMS a citizen of the United Kingdom but reside in South Africa on political/racial grounds. I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In January of this year, South Africa went into conflict with Zimbabwe over the political future of President Robert Mugabe, and was a base for a lot of threatening and destructive mail and phone calls/ faxes sent to President Mugabe by the people of Zimbabwe. On this note, my department was compelled to seek a safe haven in South Africa to transfer the sum of US$8.000,000,000.00 (Eight Million, six Hundred Thousand united state dollars)  which was deposited in a banking vault for safe keeping in my country.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in countries like South Africa where the money was. I was the Branch Manager of the Metal Munitions Corporation here in South Africa until my retirement in late last year. I have the authority of my bank to seek for foreigners as partners to carry out this transaction with. But in my search for partners, I came across your contact through South Africa Chamber of Commerce and Trade. I have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum, 60% for us, 10% for charity both in Africa and abroad and the remaining 10% which I will use for my own purposes. Please if you are not capable to do this transaction, do not hesitate to contact me at this email address for more information on how we can proceed. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. JOHN O. WILLIAMS

We are farmers and industrialists based in the Rand Province, in West Africa. I have lost confidence with any member of my family member who is not of the same colour with my father. He was poisoned to death by his own family members on the day of harvest time in 1997. Shortly before his death, he told me that he deposited the sum of US 8.2 million (Eight million, two hundred and twenty two thousand U.S. dollars) in one of the private  bank vaults in Africa. I have been farming and  manufacturing in the same locality for the past 13 years and I have the documents to prove that the money was  produced in the  country.

I am contacting you to   arrange for the transfer of this money to your account, I have decided to give you 20% of the total  transfer sum, while the balance will be mine and my family's share after the transfer. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the  Central Bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country  for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investments, either in your country or any country you might   recommend.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE Dear, I am pleased to inform you of a very urgent and profitable transaction that will benefit both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigations and Accounting  engagements in the department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, we discovered an over-invoiced contract  with a foreign supplier whose name was withheld for security and legal reasons, but  whose identity could not be disclosed because of the presence of  security agreement in place for several years. Based on the above discovered, I and other top officials in the  department now decided that an over-invoiced contract must be paid and this is why i  decided to seek your help in a business transaction. I was Counselor to Sheikh Mouna Abacha, the former head of state and the current
 bank  consultant to me, who died together with my wife and only daughter in a plane crash on 8th early  morning Georgia on the 28th June 1994. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we could not release it  until the next policy changes were implemented. However, since we tillee  can not restore the money to the bank account where it belongs to  the family account, we now request for your assistance to pay off the contract  which the vendor has to a foreign account for the authorisation of the  cheque be issued to him, because i don't  want the total contract sum of US$27.5MILLION to be in the bank  account for the authorisation of the cheque. Note that  the company  which you are about to nominate is by virtue of its financial success For  this reason, it is in the interest of the bank to transfer the  money to your account with your company's bank account, as the vendor's  account is in a different bank from the bank account you are about to nominate for this  transaction, as it was his company's account owner durin  with the forwarding of  legacy cheque payments. On this discovery, we now nominate to you the product  account where the money is to be remitted and payed off the balance of the contract  sum. It is only you who has the authority to approve this  transaction, as the account owner of the original contractor, and  the account is secured with a Key fob and a bedsheet over the key fob and the key  fob is kept in the account. The cheque for the transfer is being  approved and approved for immediate remittance to  your Company's bank account  where it will be remitted in the next  instructional steps to be taken by you. To enable the immediate transfer  of this fund to your account, you will first apply to  the bank as the beneficiary of the account, and afterward,  the cheque for the transfer will be cleared for  reimbursement to your bank account from the vendor of the account  you are about to nominate. Be informed that as the  account owner of the account is the Overseas Bank, they will approve  the transfer to  your bank account.

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL -TRANSFER OF $19,000,000.00 USD PER MONTH ATTN: PRESIDENT /CEO                CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir, I am Mr.P.Williams a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling $19,000, 000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$19,000, 000.00) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$19,000, 000.00, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and regard. Endeavor to contact me immediately via my email address:p_williams@tiscali.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours faithfully, Mr.P. Williams

Dear friend, I am Mr. Mike Hammer, from the national credit unions department here in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Dr. Peter G. Bechtel Company, Miss Veronica Shabana made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(twenty-five million dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from her contract employers, that Miss Veronica Shabana died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace her next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Miss Veronica Shabana did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand as the next of kin to Miss Veronica Shabana so that the fruits of this old woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please mail back this email to me. Rest assured that I will be grateful if you can be able to receive this money through my other bank accounts. Please upon your response, reply immediately via this email address mikehammer@netscape.net Thank you. Mr. Mike Hammer

 CONCORDE TRANSFER        
       
 Good day. My name is Mr. Allen Frank from the Western Africa, and I work with the United Nation Abroad. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 8, 2000, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian Oil Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$15,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thank you. Send your fax and phone number to  or peter2bennett@mail2world.com

In view of this we are soliciting your assistance in the following ways. 1. to provide a bank account into which this money would be channeled for immediate investment on any viable project. 2. to serve as a guardian of this fund since I am a foreigner. 3. to make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a residential permit in your country.  4.

Michael, the director in charge of auditing and accounts unit, bank of africa,burkina faso. I got your contact during my search for a reliable partner. During my digression in this business, I discovered a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our foreign customer who died in a plane crash, and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody eit her in our custody either. The said amount was USD20.5M, which we the officials had deliberately over estimated because of our position in the bank. Such amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the plantations on our farms and also for the construction of new farms. Though what disturbs me most is the fact that we have been unable to get any of these customers relatives for this transaction. I have been trying my best to locate any of the deceased relatives but I can not do it alone. I am however going to rely on informant and  trustworthy person who will assist me in this business I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this business apart from my entourage who did during their stay in this country.On this note, I decided to seek for a foreign partner in a country which has similar name with your country and I have decided to invest this money there as the investment is based on trust as we are coming from a farming background and we have a lot of residue money from previous years expences. On this note, I am inviting you to come and work with us for us to successfully conclude this business. All the necessary legal documents which will be used to back up your claim are being worked out and by the acknowledgement of your interest I will be in communication with you to enable you start to see the benefit of this project. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no problem.

I found your contact  through the internet i must say  thank you. Recently I found myself under the impression that  I am going to become  an                        person of  East  Asian descent. After  my sick leave, I was mandated to   report to my head office in  Hanoi, Vientiane who   has  the  jurisdiction to know   the   personal  information  about my  affairs. On the    first of   December,  2001, an Oil consultant/contractor with the    country  , Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve   calendar months, valued at USD$14,600,000.00(USD)   in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply.   After a   month,  we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers,   the    Noodle   Company, that Mr. Phillip Morris died   from an automobile accident. On further investigation   I found out that he  died without  making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless. I therefore   made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any  next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his  bank deposit papers in my bank. This sum of USD$14,600,000.00 is still in my bank and   the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of   each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to traditional   law, at the expiration of   5 (five) years, the money will revert   to the ownership of the   government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as   next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into   the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney  will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as   the next of kin.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $45.5m represents the balance of the total revenue collections from oil sale which was approved by the South Africa Revenue and Customs Department during the last government of Nelson Mandela.  As a matter of urgency, I have arranged for the payment to be made to any foreign account provided by a foreigner.  The fund will be shared in the ratio of 60% for us and 40% for a share of the Foreign Commercials. All necessary arrangement is in place to ensure a hitch free transfer of the fund to any foreign account.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Pakistani National Gold Corp that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died on an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa had died in the July 4th, 1999 plane crash of Egypt Air Flt 990, a Boeing 747-200, with other passengers on board. On further investigation, I found out that Mr. Mustafa had been a contractor with the Moijiya Petroleum Corporation and his contract was over-invoiced by him. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the government of his hometown based on the parties political line-up and was consequently driven into exile. Thereafter he died, he was buried in his country. I am contacting you in order to seek your assistance in transferring this money out of Pakistan so that we can use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country. On this note, I decided to seek your assistance in transferring this money to a foreign account because as refugee camps in the Middle East do not allow refugee to open bank accounts or be involved in financial transaction of any kind, hence the money will be sent to your account. On this note, I am soliciting for your international assistance in the following ways: to provide a bank account where the money will be transferred to. To serve as the front-end account holder of the fund and to make arrangement for when the money will be transferred into your account. At the conclusion of the transfer, 50% of 50% will be for me, I will give you 30% of the total transfer sum, and 10% for charity both in and out of the refugee camp. Please, I want humility in mind when I say this, I will be grateful if you could provide me with your private phone and fax numbers. Thanks and God bless, Mr. Nasser Ali  _________________________________________________________ Gagnez des écrans plats, les plats créez votre enfant  http://www.screen.fr/plats--disque/

Title: PLEASE GET BACK TO ME.
 PLEASE GET BACK TO ME. Dear , I am Mrs. Melina Sánchez, the wife of late president of Mexico, General Guillermo Flores Flores  of the Independent State Guatemala. During the current war on drugs in my country, my husband was arrested and detained by the government of President Robert  Menéndez and his men on several occasions. On one such occasion, President Menéndez ordered the attorney general to investigate all drugs smuggling and money laundering and to seize all the bank accounts of drug dealing and drug related companies in my country. On this discovery, President Menéndez ordered his security men to invade my country and arrest my husband, but on the other hand, they also gave me the order to surrender my husband to them for safe keeping and disbursement since he was arrested and detained. I did not know at the time that my husband was arrested and detained that I would be arrested and detained without just cause or any thing for it. As a result of the present situation, my husband and my only son, Gilbert Flores, who is nearly 8 years old, has gone missing. Especially, he left with his entire family to avoid further detention and Incidents. I have been managing this fund on behalf of the family for us. As a widow, I am saddled with the responsibilities and obligation of caring for a widowed husband and son who is almost 8 years old.It is for this reason that I asked you to come forward and help us. In fact, I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer since I am a woman. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transfered   to his country of origin. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount as gratification and 70% for us respectively.Please, you have been advised to maintain the absolute secrecy and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please, you have been advised to keep this transaction secret and confidential.Please, you have been advised to entertain no fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 3-4 banking days.I will be with you as soon as possible to let you know the progress of this process.

I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that  can be of mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the  transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died withhis money in his account in  the bank here in  Ouagadougou Burkina faso West Africa,  which was kept in his account with this Bank without any claim of thefund  in our custody eit dor the said amount being in the tune of 39.5m US$(Thirty five  millionfive United States  Dollars). As it may interest you to know ,in  our bank depositing guidelines, we  cannot release such amount to any person notarized by us first.  As the Manager in charge of this bank, I have decided  to  release this fund to any one who will become our next of kin  or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  no  person knows about this account and nobody will come for it and claims  it either from our bank or the deceased. In fact, the bank has  already instructed us to prepare a notification to the bank  of any time such money is  mentioned in our bank files.                                  STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   You may be surprised to receive this letter from me, since you don't know me personally,but  I got your contact through a friend who works with this bank, and I felt                                      CONFIDENTIAL                   ;w: !                         I am Mr  Noni Rose, the Auditor General in the Public Accounts Department in  BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). In my  investigation and auditing in this bank, I discovered an account opened in this bank in  1993 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after going by   the  records kept in this bank. I am of the settled conviction that with the  additional information that I gathered about this account, a company,   which my colleagues and I will bequeath to you as a favour or reward for your effort   -  And if you are willing to assist us, kindly furnish us with your full name and address   so that we can forward the necessary information to the bank.   In the light of this  discovery, I have decided to offer a 25 %  of the total sum to any person who will act as our next of kin   and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new   Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, if you are willing toassist us, contact me immediately through my email   for further instructions.   In the light of all these  considerations, I request you to endeavour to send to me immediately any information about your   bank account which you will provide, so that I can give you a call for the establishment of    a transfer of this money directly to your account, upon your positive response and once I hear from   you, I will give you more details on the   telephone number of our bank which is 5 bp 16    and also for further details regarding this transaction. At this   instant, I will call you for   discussion on the following points: (1) What is the interest of the   bank upon maturity   (2) What is the interest rate of the bank upon maturity   (3) How much will it cost to commence this business on behalf   of one of my colleagues who is on leave   ?

 Request for assistance from you,  Belgium. Dear Sir, I got your email address  while searching  for another who will be capable and willing to assist me in this  business. We will start by going over the details. I am the Managing Director of  accounts management section in the cash haven municipality here in  the Netherlands.I am writing following the impressive  information about your company from foreign financial services  firms that I have received about your company's business practices.In fact, I can name  more foreign financial services firms abroad that I have contacted and  I will rely on them to fasten this transaction. I have a very urgent and  confidential  need for your company's bank account number, to enable  the transfer of the fund to any foreign account you will nominate. The amount involved is 15,000,000.00  (Fifteen Million US Dollars) only. I am contacting you because of  the need to transfer this fund to your account for my personal investment. I  have decided to part company with you because, in my department, we discovered an abandoned sum  of $ 15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million US Dollar) in an account  belonging to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family  in a plane crash on the 1st Oct. 2002 in (Egyptair.com - www.egyptair.com)  plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it  unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or next of destination  to the deceased as indicated in our un-disclosed contract documents with  our bank.          However, all his supposed next of kin in the banking services  department  died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the  claim.      This sum of US$ 15.5M is still sitting in our bank  and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.   This means that the money will be for us  as  the fund owner after the death of the  owner.                This is the actual situation that we are in now and we  hope that  you will come to us for help in the  transfer of this  money to any account you will nominate. We have agreed to give you 20% of the  total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses  incurred in the course of the  transfer  and the remaining 75% for the fund  management.                               Please  send your reply through my email address  as you received it from the dead  customer service representative.

Upon maturity, he  contacted us and asked us to retrieve the funds by  arrangements with a foreign bank.  We were mandated to provide his foreign bank account  as the source of the funds. Upon this, we discovered an abandoned account in the  name of Mr. Philip Morris.  This account has been dormant since 1980 and had no other beneficiary.  This account has the same account number as the  account listed in our banking guidelines but we were unable to trace the  next of kin from the last time we had  correspondence with him.

I am Mr. Marc Onuf,Bank of South Africa Ltd and I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$5,200,000.00(Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations anywhere in his official papers, including the paper work of his bank deposit. This sum of US$5,200,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately.  Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of

On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Charles Bello made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,500,000.00(Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Charles Bello died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Bello did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$8,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Bello so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtained the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account inany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Regards, Mr. M.T. Kone.

Since we got information about his death,  we have been expecting his next of kin who  should be entitled to claim his money because we cannot release it  unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the  deceased as the next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash  leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to do business  with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since no  one is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank  treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here  stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin  in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner.

I am MR JAMES BABIEN, the Bank Manager in charge of Foreign and Domestic Remittance Departments of the Bank of Africa (B.O.A)ZIMBABWE. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $18.5M (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars)m, in an account that bordered on the excess of $12.5million. We have since traced the entire money to a private bank in Africa, where the owner was a foreigner and the account was established.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for our farms and we were therefore forced to import most of the chemicals for our farms from abroad.  Currently, we are exporting some of the seed- sows to feed the local people because the local people are very poor.

Title: RE: REGARD FIND TRUSTEE
 RE: REGARD FIND TRUSTEE ATTN: Sir Please, I wish to solicit your confidence in this transaction. My name is Mr. Randall Chan, a native of Hong Kong, but reside in mainland China. I am an Executive Accountant with the People's Bank of China, 1-Fangshan Road, Central City. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the People's Bank of China, Mr. Ben Johnson made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00 (Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the People's Bank of China that Mr. Ben Johnson died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) Flight 990, (an Airbus 330) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ben Johnson did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Ben Johnson so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. It is at this stage that you will be given 25% of the total amount, 70% would be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incure during the process of this transaction and 5% will be set aside for charity both in Africa and in your country as well. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours truly, Mr. Randall Chan

Title: URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TOYOU!!!
 URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TOYOU!!! ATTN.Sir. I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but i needed your assistance to make this happen. I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist me, but after i prayed for GOD'S devine mercies,i decided to contact you over this urgent matter. In my humble opinion, you are the only person that could be called upon to champion this transaction. I am Mr Martin James, the Administrative Chairman of the Contract Award Committee (CAC) of the Federal Government of Nigeria (GB) and I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On the date of award of the contract report for the year 2001/2002, I personally went to the Federal Government of Nigeria (GB) Office in the Federal Capital Territory to make an appointment for the contract report copy-pasted from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the year 2001/2002. On the appointment of a Contract Review Panel (CRP) I took special note of the appointment of this new body and decided to forwarded to the whole Government for an explanation. The Director of the CJNGO, Mr. (MR) Abias was scheduled to appear before the whole Government for an explanation, but on the finalisation of the contract, we learnt from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that Mr. (MR) Abias died on 29th January 2003 in plane crash along with his family on a tour to promote the Government's projects.  On this discovery, we decided to forward this information to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for an explanation as well as for a proper audit of the year against 2001/2002. The contract was essentially approved by the Contract Review Panel (CRP) during the year 2001/2002. After the year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) advised us to submit the above information to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for an explanation. We so happened to be in the position of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the time of the death of this customer, so we were therefore made the next of kin to the deceased. As the head of the Central Bank, I have the authority of my colleagues to approve the payment of this claim on behalf of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to any foreign or locally known bank account you will provide. The payment of this claim is officially made by the Federal Government of Nigeria (GB) office in the Federal Capital Territory, but we are told that we have agreed to remit this amount into any account which you will nominate overseas for the payment of this claim. This is the reason why I wanted you to act as the next of kin to the deceased by providing any bank account where this money will be remitted for an investment of our choice. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a contract all in itself, provided that you will honour to supply your account for the payment of this claim. If, however, you are not capable to execute this claim on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria (GB) office, then kindly furnish us with your personal bank information, such as your name, your address, and your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Waiting for your response. Please, this transaction demand secrecy, so that the truth of this transaction will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. Yours faithfully, Mr Martin James.

Title: Re: BUSINESS TRANSACTION
 RE: BUSINESS TRANSACTION Dear Sir, I presume this letter is not to be considered a bribe    but only a desperate search for assistance that can help a   poor and helpless woman I know of in need. I am a widow and mother of two children. I am Mrs.Teresa Manzur, wife of late Mr.David Manzur a citizen of Republic of Liberia (former Republic of Sierra-Leone). Before my husband was seriously injured, he buried me in his village near here in West  Africa and told everybody about it. But no one knew and he told me so. After the death of my husband, my family members and I who were very rich in business decided to move out of Liberia to the Republic of West Africa. I know this because my late husband used my maiden name but I was made to sign a binding agreement to keep secret and bind us to secrecy. I am Mrs.Teresa Manzur, wife of late Mr.David Manzur, who was seriously injured in the plane crash of AF4590 airlinerliner on March 9, 2003,including post-mortem report. All our documents of account were seized and my husband's name was used to file for the claims and as a witness in the claims. The bank account in the bank in which I work as an account officer is now for the last time being  secretly protected by the Federal Government of Liberia. My husband's business was hit and he was forced to close down all our branches and to resettle all the employees. He had to make a last-minute effort to call me because of the bad situation there, but I could do nothing for him because of the power vacuum in the bank. After my husband died, the bank director told me that he deposited the sum of US$ 18.5 million (Sixty eighteen million US dollar) in one of the private security companies in Europe. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I would transfer this money and use it in any profitable venture. He also explained to me that it was because of this money that he was forced to move out of the country that he deposited the sum of US$ 18.5 million (Sixty eighteen million US dollar) in one of the private security companies in Europe. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it in any profitable venture. He also explained to me that it was because of this money that he was forced to move out of the country that he deposited the sum of US$ 18.5 million (Sixty eighteen million US dollar) in one of the private security companies in Europe. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it in any profitable venture. He also explained to me that it was because of this money that he was forced to relocate the funds and that it was because of this money that the Bank of Europe transferred this money to a foreign account overseas. I hope that you will agree to help me in giving you a fair hearing in this transaction. I promise to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses that might be incurred by both parties during the transfer. Please, I need your assistance in receiving this money into your account. As soon as I get your positive response, I shall give you more details on behalf of my partners. I await your urgent reply. Best regards, Mrs.Teresa Manzur.

Title: urgent reply.
 urgent reply. Dear Friend, I am Ndebe kabore, the Director incharge of Auditing and Accounting  departments in one of the prime banks here in  Johannesburg, South Africa.I am writing  this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out  this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corp, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in  our branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply,  so we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corp  that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with EgyptAir Flight 990] with other passengers on board.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without ever making a WILL and  all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,000,000.00and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year.  This is what I did not know at the time, and still  do not know.  I have since  discovered that no other person knows about this deposit, and my  position as the Head of bank guarantees the success of this  scheme.  I can only hope that this  scheme will succeed without any infraction from your side.  Please, if you are willing  to assist, contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number for more details.   Best regard Ndebe Kabore

Title: From: Mr. Hill To: Mr. Hill. Sir, I am Mr. Hill. a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining and Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be inform that a decision has been taken by our Bank S.Africa -chartered account to redevelop the account of Mr. Hill with the Delivery Company,  based on the fact that we are from the same country. This is because Mr. Hill and his wife Ms. Mary Hill were both born and bred in the same country and now they are both from the same country. This has created a situation where it will be very difficult or impossible to transfer the funds  once deposited into the bank account due to the fact that he is a foreigner. We have agreed to give 10% of the total sum as compensation for your effort or your evil assistance, 5% for charity both in Africa and in your country and the rest of the fund is for the purchase of new machines and chemicals and the establishment of new machines and chemicals in Africa. I will like you to contact us immediately as soon as you receive this mail through my above bank account, for more details. I will be glad to  hear from you as soon as possible. Please mail me through one of the above email addresses if you are interested. Thanks and God bless, Please mail me through: hill_2007@yahoo.co.uk Respectfully yours, Mr. Hill.

I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Robert Williams died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$1,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

Dear Friend, I am Mr. Eric Wong the manager in account accounting section in bank of africa (BOA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr.  Ahmed Yousef Mustafa made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, oil contractor that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died in the plane crash On October 31,1997, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempt to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the government of president Mohamed Obeidi and was consequently driven from office. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had deliberately kept the $10,000,000.00 in cash in a security company here in Burkina faso. This amount $10,000,000.00 is still in the security company and it is safe in my company. My share of the $10,000,000.00 was US$1million.00, 10% of the US$10,000,000.00;5% profit. The security company will pay us 25% of the net amount US$10,000,000.00. I accept your right to privacy and confidentiality, and request that you please treat this matter as top secret. Please get back to me as soon as possible. Note that this transaction is 100% safe, on  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount.

Title: MY INTRODUCTION
 MY INTRODUCTION Dear Sir, My name is Mr.John Moyo, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the duty of compiling and maintaining accurate list of all foreign bank accounts belonging to non-Swiss indigenes throughout the world. ICEP makes all necessary arrangements to ensure that all claims for the fund were made, but due to the non-Swiss Identity. Consequently, all bank accounts belonging to non-Swiss indigenes are being monitored and all remittances are being under way for the payout to any foreign bank account that can be convincingly guaranteed as being owned by a non-Swiss indigen. Due to our position as civil servants, we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves and so the Central Bank of Switzerland (CBC) has been authorized to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account for this transaction within a reasonable time. At this stage, all we want is for the note to be paid to any foreign bank account that can be convincingly guaranteed as being owned by a non-Swiss indigen; however, due to the sensitive nature of our jobs, we are not going to give you 100% security as all arrangements have been made for the transfer. On successful remittance of this fund into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the total sum not being paid into your account due to our sensitive position here in Switzerland. Though, your account has been setup for a transfer of this nature, please be assured that all modalities for fund transfer have been worked out and all modalities will be finalised upon your acceptance to move forward. We are however ready to entertain any questions from you for a thorough discussion. Please write via the above email, solely for your view. Note that the transfer will only take us about 14 working days to finish the transfer; you should email us at: icepe2003_200701@yahoo.co.uk thanks for your anticipated co-operation. Thanks for your kind response. Sincerely, Mr. John Moyo

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE
 URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE ATTN: President/CEO Dear Sir, I am Dr. Rick Albled, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining and Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to my office.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining and Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18.500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $18.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I don't know you personally, but I am persuaded by the person I am going to confide in for this important business. I am Dr. Afolabi S. Abacha, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my  department who died on [expired] fixed deposit of us$18.2M (Eighteen Million Two Hundred Thousand U. A.D.C.) with a fixed  balance of $46,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thousand U. A.D.C.) in a bank here in South Africa. When the deceased  customer died, his bank account was hacked and he left behind no  and documents that proves his death.       On further investigation, I found out that he was a foreigner and my identity as an  Indian is not in the records.     So, the next thing I wanted to do was to notify the bank about the  situation and I was advised to do so by the banking ethics officer  who I trust  will be with you   for a  short   period of  time     before you can proceed further with   this transaction.   I trust  you will be able to handle this transaction for us, and for that   amount of  $36 ,000.00, we  will pay in   the  name of his  dead  customers,   and I  the bank adress  where we live in South Africa and we will transfer the   sum of  64,000,000.00 USD    (Forty eight million two hundred thousand U. A.D.C) in    the  bank account of the   person who is to act as the beneficiary of   the  balance of  64,000,000.00 USD   (Forty eight million two hundred thousand U. A.D.C.) from the   bank to your   account, it became   necessary that I  inform you of this development   when I  got your contact   details   from   the  safe online banking     the  bank adress                            I will  then  check if   you    will  be  able to  provide  your  bank   account   where we shall transfer the   money.       1. We will send to you   the  text of the application that   you will fill and   bring to   the bank   where the  money will be   transferred into.    2.  We will apply for  visa  at the  port of   where the  money will

Title: RE: PROPOSAL
 RE: PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I am (Michael wu      ) the above stated reason why i decided to contact you on this transaction/ business of a confidential nature. I got your contact through our chamber of commerce here in South Africa for our mutual benefit. During our tour business-center in the center of the continent, i stopped in front of my bank and presented my business proposal to them, then i asked them to please honor me as their next of kin because we have discontinued all transactions with any body besides my family and I because my father   died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. After i submitted my business proposal to them, i proceeded to deposit the sum of US$16.5 million  ($16.5 million) in their branch. This sum of US$16.5 million was money i keep in a box in my bank in my home city Johannesburg. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms,but instead, it was used for the fabrication of fake will, and eventually for the money i keep in my home. I have since then i have secretly discussed this amount with a trusted banker friend who advised me to secure a foreign bank account, as it may be of use to me in the future. I am at this moment looking for a foreigner who will act as the next of kin to my late father, so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. I have been advised to forward your contact to the banker so that we can proceed forwarding all the required documents to the bank. I have decided to do this only because I want this money to be send to any foreigner, and my banker friends are using every trick in the book to protect us from seeing this money's, but we will not give up hope either, as all the legal documents that will back you up as the next of kin to my father will be secured and you will send me the documents over the bank's secure e-mail, which I will copy and paste into any suitable e-mail you will send over my banker's secure e-mail which I will forward to the bank's management. Please refer to the pictures in the message as it will explain how this money will be remitted. I will be waiting for your reply. Please, during this time you will also inform me of your personal fax number and phone number for easy communication. Yours truly, Michael wu Please Reply Back

 ATTN.E-MAIL.BUSINESS/RE: BUSINESS PROJECT. Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Mr.Jimmy Sokol from Sierra-Leone.

I got your e-mail address through the internet when searching for a reliable and trustworthy person that will assist me in a business transaction of this magnitude. I am Mr. Jimmy Sokol, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland's highest investigative body, which is charged with the responsibility of locating bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes. Accounts of this type are very rare and difficult to locate, especially in Switzerland. The actual owner of these accounts is still a mystery. The accounts have been dormant since World War II and the accounts have no other beneficiaries. It is in this context that I decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you for the co-investigation of a business transaction worth the sum of $18Million.   The main reason for writing is that no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company. I don't want this amount to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after three years, the bank will transfer the money into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as partner in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as the partner of a foreigner. In the course of carrying out our banking functions at the bank, we discovered an account opened in this bank by a foreigner who died without a written or oral WILL attached to the account, this account was opened in this bank without a written or oral WILL attached to it. The information about this account was given to me by the Director of account management of this bank who I entrust this information with you. I want you to assist me in receiving this money in your bank account as the beneficiary of the funds.    You should also furnish me your bank account information for easy and safe communication. I will provided with details of your bank account to enable you transfer this money to any account nominated by you. Please, I need your assistance to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion. I will be at your side during the transfer and at your expense,as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.

To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund and also apply to the bank as the account where the total amount in question will be transferred. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk &amp; trouble free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during the transfer process.

The discovery  of this   anomaly and the reason why we are contacting you now is because    from the records of this deceased person's bank in Nigeria,   there is a claim  against his account but the account has remained dormant    without any claim of the fund in our bank.

The bank   is now expecting a  tranfer of this fund to a foreign bank account but the account has   been dormant for   years. The amount involved is 23M,seven hundred and fifty thousand   (USD)Seven hundred   dollars. We are ready to settle the fund in any bank account in your country but the accounts of   ordinary people are not safe, and especially   account of  such high  security are not safe.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.
 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Fredrick David from Lagos. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Frank McDonald made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, Valued at US$5,000,000.00(Five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Frank McDonald died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Frank McDonald did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$5,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Frank McDonald so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr.Fredrick David

Title: Urgent Attention
 Urgent Attention Attn:Sir/Madam You may be surprised to receive this letter from me, but I must  beg your indulgence and trust. I am Mr. Mahdi G. Abacha , the only son of late leader of the resistance groups  armed forces of Sudanese President Omar Badie . I was a very privileged and trusted group of people who were doing do   business in the port city of Dakar Senegal, when suddenly our mighty leader Mr. Omar Badie died with his entire family on   his first wedding day.On his deathbed,he  told us that he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000,00 US  DOLLARS (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  in one of the private security companies in the capital city,   Johannesburg, that he deposited this money in the security company because he   realized  that it is the only  thing  he can do to ensure that the fund is  intact in his account before it get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials and  who would use this money to launder the money through illegal ways,   such as money    from   unclaimed   late husbands   or  orphans.   This money was deposited in a  compartmentalization   vault   that our bank in the country, and it was meant for the purchase of new machines and new chemicals for the farms and for the  establishment of new farms in the country. These   farm  defectors are  still in camps and  are still  suffering from the long and hard line  resistance of the former regime. They  still have some hope that the future of their country will be very much   better if they can be convinced by the international community that this money was   brought to them by some foreign   company   and they should not open any bank account or  to have any  involvement in the  business of the  country. It is only to enable  them transfer this money, they urgently needed, they urgently needed it, and they urgently needed it now.     We urgently need your urgent and urgent assistance, as our bank in the country is now on strike because of the strike and people are trying to get into   the bank treasury accounts but our bank is  not  able to do so, due to  the strike. It is only a  situation  that we find ourselves in now, that it is  necessary for us to make  this  transfer.  When the strike was at its height, the bank in the country, the president of the bank, the director of credit and the manager of the foreign currency bills paid their last meeting and a resolution was passed that  the bank should resume  normal business for the payments of the notes due to the strike.  Now that the bank is on strike, the bank accounts belonging to the directors of credit and the manager  of the foreign currency bills have been abandoned by the government. The balance of the notes are still being   paid to the bank by the   government authorities. The  demand of   the strike and the fact that the bank is on strike  has made it necessary to transfer the whole   sum of 18 million seven hundred thousand   us dollars. Now all the bank   accounts belonging to the   foreign  company owner   is being  abandoned by the government.

From: "Mark Wahlberg" Tel: 00229 74 626 7877 Fax: 00229 74 626 7912@markwahlberg55534@yahoo.co.uk I am Mark Wahlberg a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign Non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a Foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) bill to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20%, 30% of the $26.5 million, 70% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid continuance. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately whether or not you are interested in this deal. If however you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours faithfully, Mark Wahlberg From: Mr Mark Wahlberg.

I have since  traced the owner of this account  to this same bank but I can not get in due  pursuit of a lucrative business opportunity.  I am Professing to write to inform you of a transaction  that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end  of the transaction. During my  tenure as an  Executive Accountant / Auditing  official in the  Bank of  South Africa (BOA)  here in South Africa, I discovered an unclaimed  (twenty  million U. S. A DOLLARS  only) in an account  that  belongs to one of our  foreign customers who died in  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his  account with this Bank for a very  long time and no  person has come to claim  the fund.  Although personally, I  have  always maintained that no  person  shall be  compelled to  testify  or  cooperate  with  any  Government  department  at     this time, it is  only a    personal  interest I  feel                                 There was a  fire,  which  broke out  in  an  office  of  our bank  where  the  manager  and  chief  were  in  charge of  foreign  and  local  accounts. They died  in  plane crash on  their  way  into     from  Toronto,  on  July 27, 2003. They died  as a result of  plane crash  with the loss of  their  lives  and the  company was  forced to close  down  their  office  here in South Africa. As the  manager  and chief  of  the  bank,  I  received   a delivery     from the                                                                                               Payment   was   made to  me   a  late husband because of  the  times  being  between  and  (   one  year  ) before his  death. I  already  knew  that no    person  will   bear   the  responsibility  for this  loss  noone will  come  to  me  on         no/ will  not  deny  the  existence  of the  note  in  transaction. Hence the reason why I  need your assistance  in  the following ways: a. To  provide a  bank account  where  you will  open  the        account  where  you will  withdraw  the                                      You will be elaborating  to me  the  banking  method   used in  this  business  and  the  method  used  in  the                                                                       The  amount  of  USD $10million  will  be paid into  the  account  as  soon as                                                           Note:  If  you are  willing  to  work with  me  and  we will  agree   that   15%  of  the  total  balance  USD $10million will  be paid into  the  account  for us  to  use in             —                      Finalizing  the   transactions    that

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian government, that Mr. Paul Konopek died in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Konopek did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$16,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegal Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an individual to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Konopek so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please send your reply to:bola_samatigui@tiscali.co.uk Regards, Mr.Bola Samatigui

Title: ATTN.VERY IMPORTANT.
 ATTN.VERY IMPORTANT. Hello,  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Laurent Kabila  the  son of the late president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,Rapha-  amir Abacha. I was the Auditor General of Diamond Bank  before he died.  I was his personal lawyer and he entrusted my father's bank account  to me for safe keeping of the fund that his bank,Dion &amp;  other banks had deposited in the account.   After the death of my father, his personal lawyer, Mr. Aaron S. Kone,   made a numbered fixed deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000,000.00(Twenty  million dollars) in the account.  Upon maturity,  the bank sent a routine notification to me, but I  never got any response.   After a  year and a half, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that  Mr. Aaron S. Kone  died in a plane crash on the 1st of November, 2000.   On further investigation, I found out that he died without  making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  my father,  never- the less, deposited a fixed sum of $3,500,000.00(Three millions dollars)  in his personal bank account.   This sum of $3,500,000.00 was  discovered by me when I was still a  child and it remains  uncontrolled to this day.   This amount is  still  sitting in the account and the interest is  running  on  the   sum of the   money.   The banking  law and  guidelines here  prohibit a child below the  age  18 years; therefore,  my  purpose  in contacting you is  to                                         to     arrange for the transfer of this money to your account  for our mutual benefits.    I  cannot   write you a check, because I am a   woman; my pay grade is    not enough   for a woman to   write a Will; however,   I can  arrange for the issuance  of a WILL and obtain the necessary information   from the  probate office in favor of  the  transfer.    I will deliver to you the  bank account where the money will be  transferred to,   the  hospital where the money will be   transfered and the name of the  probate lawyer who will  act for the  person who will   inherit the    money.   I have  described  the   problem                           who will   inherit   the  money.   I will   arrange to travel to   the  bank   and        to       provide  the   bank  with   the necessary legal  documents  which will    :                         provide  the   bank  with  the   necessary legal  documents   which will   :                       THAT  _ DON'T RUIN THE  CASE   INVOLVED.

I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Export Promotion Council that Mr.Richard Moss died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it according to African laws, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerians if nobody applies to claim the fund.

This is simple, I will like you immediately to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.

While i was working at the NNPC, we  discovered an excess of crude oil in my account, which we did not disclose to our management. This crude oil is the  equivalent of four months worth of oil in volume. The excess of this oil in my account has in our company treasury and we  are willing to part with most of the oil for corporate investment. However, after the assassination of our president on the 4th of  November 2002, we were informed that America government were going to cut off all ties  with the Sudanese, so we decided to transfer the excess money to foreign account which is why the money is being  being sent to you. From the account we discovered an account of one Mr.  Amadou Diop who died with his entire family on 25th of january 2003 in plane crash, and  the money has been with us in Nigeria since then. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it on account of  security reasons.  Now, with the death of our president on 25th of April, 2003, it's on the order of urgent to transfer the money  to any account which you will provide.  All modalities for fund transfer has been worked out for the fund to be  released within a maximum of 7 to 8 banking days.  Please be informed that there is the possibility of a very good return on investment when fully  transferred into your account. More so, you will be given 20% of the total amount, 60%  will be for me, while the remaining 10% will be for any expenses that  might be incurred during the process of transferring. Please, get in touch with me immediately through my private and  confidential email above, so that we can proceed  the transfer process.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total foreign contract payments which our department in the past year alone has made to the tune of $22.5Millionplus. As civil servants we are not allowed to operate bank accounts hence our reliance the trust and confidentiality of the person who will always be with us in this business. To overcome this hurdle, we have been awarded a sum of $26.5Million by a major bank in London. I have been awarded this sum of $26.5 million by virtue of my position as a member of the bank's Credit and Foreign Remittance committee. I have been awarded this sum of $26.5 million in cash by the bank's committee without any risk or expenses being incurred on either the bank or my side during the process of the transfer. I have signed a binding agreement that will bind us together as the bank's Credit and Foreign Remittance Committee we have agreed to share the money on an equitable basis should you be willing to oblige us that is why I have contacted you. However, as the director incharge of the bank's Credit and Foreign Remittance Committee, I have the authority of my bank's committee to over-invoie the contract completion funds which has been instigated by some disgruntled former employees who felt that they were treated fairly when they were appointed in the bank. I have already lodged a formal over-invoie claim with the bank concerned and I have agreed to remit this amount from the bank to you for us to share. However, I want you to first ensure that you are able and willing to act as the keys of the account because I will be monitoring the whole development here in South Africa and I will be eitrifying here the same. I want your safe handling of this project that I propose to bring to your notice. If you are willing to assist us, kindly send via your official e-mail address below. We will discuss in details the modalities of this project and any other follow up expenses incured by us in the course of this transaction. Please furnish me with your personal contact numbers for easy and safe communication.

 urgent reply..from michael n. Mr.Michael N. Wong. Union Bank Of China, 99 Queens Road Central Hong Kong, Dear Friend, I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both ofus.A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced youraddress, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with this matter. I am Mr.Michael N. Wong,the Head Private Banking, Union Bank Of China,also account   of late Mr.Isidor Gripen, an American who died in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde which crahsed on July 25 th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next of kin to the late person. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my bank now decided to make this  business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin to late Mr.Isidor Gripen  so that you will be able to receive his money. As it is said,    justice shall be done.According to the   rules of my bank, the money  will be paid into your account  once the fund has been   transferred into your account. I want to first transfer $25 Million   (Twenty-Five Million Dollars)   directly to your account,   then transfer the remaining balance (Twenty-Five   Million Dollars)   to your account,   which is where we will remit the   remaining balance.                               ;    ;                      ;    ;    ;    ;   ;            ;   I am contacting you because of a business transaction that we are   about to execute. On  July 9, 2000, an America's Airbus A310-800, a Concorde, with full fuel on board, flew from London ► New York, leaving nobody behind for the claim. At about 11:30  ET, the Concorde was enroute to Los Angeles when it   lost contact for an inexplicable reason,   lost signal and crashed into the ground.   The flight crew who were on board the aircraft since the loss have   communicated their desire to have the fund released to them by the Managing Director of their bank who in turn I got from them   after i had  discovered a  flaw in the system. The fund has been   waiting since then for this opportunity, hoping that it will be reincarnated into a different bank account,   but this time around, the account where the   fund was deposited and   deposited. I have since   been informed that all  accounts of this bank in this bank have been revoked and   all their data including the account information was sent to me by the   head  of the bank,   all documents pertaining to the bank which I have   in my hands now,   were fully destroyed by the bomb blast that rocked the bank on the 12th   of June,2001. That is why i am contacting you,   because this money   you will be front and center with this fund   on my behalf,   hopeing that  you will   not  betray  us    no matter what,   although you will be front and center with this fund   for your next of kin

 RE: PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I am Mr. Thomas Zebo, Bank of  South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Mark Smith made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00(fourteen  Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a  year, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Mark Smith died in an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a  WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mark Smith did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.  This sum of US$14,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim  it.  According to the South Africa Law, at the expiration of (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mark Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are immediately via this email address immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Please mailme:tzebo1@mail2world.com  Yours faithfully,  Mr. Thomas Zebo.

From: Dr.Sargeel  Slama
Title: HELLO, I am choosing to contact you to  assist me in a business deal/business  transaction of this magnitude, but I would first like to  introduce myself properly to you. I am Dr Sargeel Slama, the Head, human resources,  bank of  tigeria  amalga bank  human resources. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 18.5m US  dollars (18.5 million  dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who  died along with his entire family on the 8th of June 1997 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release  the money unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my  department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the  money to you as  the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in tigeria stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the  fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside  for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would  be for me and my colleagues. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to  the  percentage  indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as   arranged, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the  deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communications and location where in the  money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is risk free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required informations will be perfectly made for you when you reply   immediately. You should contact me   whether or not you are ready to entertain any atom of fear as all necessary   arrangements for thetransfer have been made for the transfer.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your’s faithfully, Dr.Sargeel  Slama (Bill and exchange manager) TIGER BANK#85-74-121-48130. 58830891X2.

Title: ASSISTANCE
 ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I want to first solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Before the assassination of our beloved President Benin Julius Nyerere, he secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a very large sum of money deposited in one of the private security companies here in East Africa and he asked me to discreetly look for a trusted person who will assist him in transferring this money to a foreign account because we do not want this money to go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This amount $12.5m US dollars is still in the sealed bank account here in the country and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the government if nobody applies to claim the fund. I, as a black farmer from the area who was assassinated by some government officials, will not allow this to happen to my family. I will be of assistance to you only if you will provide me with your safe bank account for the transfer. My name is Baron Omariyid, I am the eldest son of LATE CHIEF BROWN OLUMIA. My father was murdered by the government officials because he did not ally with the white farmers and my father was a black farmer from the area. My mother died when I was a baby and since then my father took me so special. Before the death of my father on 12 febuary 2003 in a private hospital here in Ibadan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has the sum of USD$12.5Million deposited in one of the private security companies in this country as if he deposited a cash sum of $12.5million, but I was afraid so I went to the government bank without a bank account hence I suffered a lot of pain and misery in my past life. Now that I am expecting my first child, I decided that I would like you to help me receive my father's money into your bank account. For you to honor this request, you are always free to write me immediately if you wish, as soon as you agree to this proposal. If you do not favor a united front with the government of Nigeria, please do not destroy my life and family by destroying my father's money because the sovereignty of Nigeria is at stake. In view of this grievous threat to my life, I request you to honor me and my family by sending us some money. But please do not destroy my father's money because we cannot live on that. This is the only hope of my life. For your support, please reply this mail, so we can proceed in confidence. Best regards, Baron Omariyid UGOROBE

On further investigation, I found out that both these deceased persons were immigrants from Iran and had nothing to do with my country.This sum of US$14,800,000.00 and the interest it accrued on it Drained us both.  I therefore made further enquiries to trace any of these deceased persons next of kin but I was informed that all attempts to trace any of the deceased person's relations or next of kin was fruitless.  This is the reason why I prayed for you Mr.Lee Kuan Yew.

 BUSINESS PROPOSAL FROM:DR. JEFF FANG. ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO  I am Dr. Jeff Fang, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the  South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this  medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of this deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$44,500,000.00) which we  want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign  company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$44.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction by way of providing the necessary account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project after transfer, you will be compensated with 20% of the total amount, 70% will be ours, while 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 5% will be set aside for charitable purposes in the form of donations of flowers and tributes to the victims.

From: Mr. Charles Sule Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basemunor banked with a U.A.E company, which we the officials of the bank are not allowed to operate bank accounts in Iraq, so we gave them the authority to close the account for safe keeping only. And the next day the account was opened and the money was paid to the account. (Suleiman al Maura) After the death of this important Iraqi businessman we were also informed that he was buried without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. And finally after several failed attempts by the officials of the bank to locate any of his relatives we were forced to close the account for good. After the death of this important Iraqi businessman our bank officials were particularly perturbed because we have not been able to locate any of his relatives and also the bank account is in the bank for safe keeping of this money. I and other officials in my bank now seek your permission to allow the messenger to come to you for permission to invest this money in your country. On this note we have decided to seek your permission to present you as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basemunor so that the proceeds of this account valued at $26.6Million would be released to you by the bank without any further delay. Be informed that the account was opened with the bank on the following account numbers: (1) bank name (2) bank account number and account number (3) account name. I will give you more details on request. I wish to end by introducing myself as Mrs. Suleiman al Maura. I am the wife of Major Fadi Basemunor who was killed during the war in a bomb blast in the Iraqi capital city Baghdad. Please, treat this matter with the utmost secrecy. And if you are interested please send me your private phone number for easy communication. I hope to hear from you soon. Regards, Mrs. Suleiman al Maura.

Title: please get back to me.
 please get back to me. Dear Friend. Attention Please, I am the above named and I wish to first solicit your confidence in this transaction.I got your email contact from the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industrial &amp; Finance businesses. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation, so that we can make this business a success. I am Mr. Maryam Abacha, the former finance director of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I was so fixated by the U.S and Iraqi war that I took refuge here in South Africa for fear of going into war, but after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by the pro-U.S. government of Ahmed Jassim, we discovered that all our bank accounts in the country were being frozen by the new Iraqi government. As a banker who knows war, this move by the new Iraqi government is very worrying indeed and I was forced to flee Iraq for fear of my life. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity. Myself and other employees at the bank now find ourselves under very great pressure from the new Iraqi government to provide any bank account where they can get out some funds and we cannot afford to let them get their hands on that. I am telling you this because I don't want this money to go into the hands of some corrupt government officials who will use it to launder money or invest it illegally in illegal ways. I couldn't bear to see this happen, so I decided to contact you for assistance, but sadly, you know nothing about this business, I am merely telling you of what I learnt about you from my personal search on the internet. Please, you have my prayer that you will not disappoint me, trustworthy and upright person I was inspired to write this letter to you. I am Mr. Maryam Abacha, the above mentioned banker; now living in South Africa; and I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity. On January 7, 2003, an America oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Peter Blenkinsop made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Peter Blenkinsop died in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Blenkinsop had actively opposed the government of his country, South Africa, and is therefore homeless. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Peter Blenkinsop so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. I will be in touch immediately you confirm to us that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your bank account, after which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If you are not, we will terminate this relationship with you without further delay. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, we shall discuss in details the modalities that will be followed in order to finalize this transaction within the shortest possible time. Please, till then, be rest assured that we shall be grateful if you could furnish us with your company's address. We invite you to contact us immediately with your confidential telephone and fax numbers AY403-2035371401234 or call us at this number 874-76-13344474621 for more briefing. Yours faithfully,  Mr. Maryam Abacha.

Title: Profiling request
 Profiling request ATTN:The President/CEO  I am Dr. A. Nkomo, the Auditor General of the Airport Authority of South Africa(S.A. ). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a Boeing 747-400, with passengers, cargo and/or crew on board, took off from Johannesburg, South Africa to fly to New York in America. We are not aware that we should worry about this as he (John Gunet) is an absolute trust worth emigration. When the 747-400 took off from Johannesburg, we were informed that all government entities had been notified and all banks and companies had been instructed to activate their banking/accounts as the affected parties and requested for their affairs to be under the control of a foreign firm. This is why I managed to get your contact details through the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry. It is with hope that I write to inform you of this proposal I have been able to trace my father's bank account from its establishment in the late 1980s until his death. But on this note, I crave your indulgence and pray you forgive me for this indiscretion. But I am compelled to ask,  Have you considered for a moment that your income tax could be on the line if this money is not paid to my father’s bank account. Moreover, your account holds a total sum of US$25.5 million  in cash and your account has NO INHERITS. So your doing this for a man who has NO INHERITS and you do not want this money to go into your account. Furthermore, you are not entitled to receive this money in your account according to the South African Banking law. In short, my father was a very wealthy businessman and he did not declare any next of kin or relations in the banking rules.  I propose to you that if you are willing to entertain this and other benefits as a result of your hard work during the re-organization of his accounts, that you should contact me immediately through the above email address for further information.  I will give you the details of my bank, the branch where we are filing in and where the money will be transferred to.  Please, I want you to treat this proposal with utmost attention. Yours faithfully,  ALFORD  Nkomo. PLEASE PLS Send your response to adomas@oxfordonline.com

When my mother died , my father took me so special because I was her only child. Before his death , he secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he died and that my mother died together. This was very surprising to me because I thought that my father would have died before he knew about my mother and also because I was expecting my mother to come and claim my father's money because my father told me to expect my mother to come and claim it for me as the next of kin. But she always called me on her bedside and informed me that my father died and that I should expect my mother to come and claim it for me. So I am here today you will find me in need of a new abode where I can continue my studies and get a good job where I can then invest my inheritance. I have decided to seek for a genuine and trustworthy foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will apply for my partner's or I will come over and apply for my own partner's visa on the spot. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because I am blind in one eye and deaf in the other. My studies will be highly dependent on your presence here in this regard because I have decided to give you 30% of the total sum if you can be a reliable partner to me. I will be most grateful if you can come down to Mecu to receive this money. I will be most grateful if you could come down to Mecu to hear me speak. I am willing to give you 15% of the total sum if you will be able to help me invest this money wisely for my children's sake. Please I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down. With God

Title: SECURITY
 SECURITY COMPLIMENTS DEAR SIR, I am James Swinford, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Fourteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($16,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $16.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department, which was amounting to US$174.8 million dollars during the last fiscal (FY18) period. Considering the nature of our jobs, we are not allowed to operate an offshore account and this is one of the main reasons we are seeking your assistance as a foreigner to act as the beneficiary of this said sum. Hence our necessity for a foreign partner who will act as the overseas beneficiary of this said sum, It is upon this discovery that I and my colleagues now decided to seek your assistance through your personal email address for easy and confidential communication. We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum, 5% for charity both at home and in your country and the remaining 75% for us and our families as it relates to the investment of our family farm in your country. Please, for the sake of our lives and the life of our families, we have decided to solicit for your support and co-operation in the execution of this deal described hereunder for the benefits of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. We are willing to compromise to a certain extent as it relates to the interest of our families, but we are willing to give you the opportunity to renegotiate or alter the percentage of interest you are to be paid on such claims upon negotiation. In that case, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as compensation for your efforts,while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction, while the remaining 75% will be for us and our family farm. Please, if you are willing to entertain any modification to this proposal, do contact me immediately so that we can discuss the modalities to finalize this transaction.If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. I will be glad to hear from you. Thanks and regards. Mr. James Swinford.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Kuwait Mining Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$35,000,000.00(Thirty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Kuwait Mining Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the kuwait law, at the expiration of  (seven) years:   people will be reincarnated into kuwait state.   The banking law and customs here  forbids a person withstanding to operate bank account or to inherit bank account.   Hence my desire:   To seek your consent and  to enable the release of the fund to your nominated bank account.        I will gladly give you 30% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction.     I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.     I am currently using the remaining 5% to buy real estate abroad and also to set up my private bank account here in kuwait.      Thanks and regards,   Mr. Nasser Hassan

I am Heedurman M.M.M.M of the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal.I got your contact through my personal search when searching for an overseas reliable and trustworthy person to handle this important business in my bank.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 18.5million US dollars which our bank now bills as a foreign export transaction, which my head office kindly agrees to bill as such, but the actual amount was $18.5m dollars I had laying in an account I manage here in my bank before the expiry of the last imported contract, which contract we executed for our customers in Nigeria and abroad.As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through a family friend who works with the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal, who also happens to be a foreigner. As it may interest you also to know, my father was also a miner and we use this money to move our ancestral estates abroad for the investment of our youth in a safer and stable environment. As it may interest you to know that I was also a business man of mine, and my father was also a businessman, so we used this money to relocate to South Africa, in the hope of secure future for our children in life.As it may interest you also to know that no accidently, my father died without having any child round the heir apparent. Although he was poisoned by his own family members. This indeed is the case, and his younger brothers and sisters died without witness or any access to any male relative hence the amount of this money was paid as inheritances. And my mother died when I was a baby. I was therefore the only heir and I was poisoned by my own family members. As it may be, I must disclose this to you with believe in God that you will stand behind my decision and always be my guardian as I work on and my father's only child. May God bless you.

Title: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
 WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? ATTN. PRESIDENT, I am Mr. lucman Yengeni, the Auditor General in the South African department of Mining and Natural Resources. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Johnnie Reilly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$19,300,000.00(Twenty-nine Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On withdrawal, the bank sent a routine notification to me, but I never got any response.  After a  month, the bank sent another reminder and finally, we discovered from his contract  employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Johnnie Reilly died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Johnnie Reilly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$19,300,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  The only available way for me to get this money is by applying for a visa on a visa versa, and I got your contact as a result of my investigation.  On this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as the next of kin to Mr. Johnnie Reilly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  The request of you as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that you have the same last name with Mr. Johnnie Reilly.  I am willing to give you 30% of the total funds,90% of which will be for me if you agree to be my partner.  If you are interested, kindly get back to me by:      You should also include your private fax and phone numbers including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.  Thanks and regards.  Mr. lucman Yengeni

Title: RE: YOUR NEED HELP.
 RE: YOUR NEED HELP. Dear Sir, How are you and your family today? I hope that you are all ok.Please let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr.Jim Smith, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. However, this is due to urgent necessity as we have been assured of your capability to handle this transaction. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the US$18.5 million, 70% of the US$30.5 million, 5% for any expenses incurred in the course of the transaction and 5% for the charitable purposes of your conscience. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid enti. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or my email address jim_smith61@yahoo.co.uk whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours faithfully, Mr.Jim Smith.

Title: Requirements
 Requirements ATTN: President/Director.                             Dear friend,     Let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am TD Amery, the manager in charge of Auditing and Accounting  departments in  the Bank of Africa (Ouagadougou).  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On  smooth conclusion of a foreign contract award which was recently concluded by  our National Electric Power Authority here in  Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm,  with the Consignment Data Form (CDF) musters, by the  National Electric Power Authority (N.E.P.A) to supply power to  households which are not thermostat controlled.  The contract was over invoiced by us and the of the Contract was awarded.  But the contract has since been cancelled and the contract is not  over invoiced, rather it has been awarded on the understanding that we will allow the  financing company to continue to pay us the difference between the actual contract  sum and the sum owing us by the contractors, it is because of this  that I got your contact.  I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in  the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will treat this  transaction with utmost attention.  I am writing because I want my bank account to be credited with  the total sum of (US$75, 000,000.00) WHICH is the actual contract sum  when actual contract have been awarded. Thereby to  enable the transfer of this fund to any foreign account you will nominate. As  I have expressed my wish to transfer to a foreign account, I do hereby seek your assistance in  enabling our bank account to be remitted.  I have secured from our bank a solution whereby the money can be  be transferred without any hitch.  To give you more information about this transaction, I got your  contact from our chamber of commerce, I will not fail to introduce that you should not entertain any fear because  your person is the medico-legal owner of the account and the Account was  secured with a security company before it was sent to your account.  Myself and my partner are in our late thirties and we are young. We are academics and  we have not done any banking before we came to your country.  This is our first account in your country and we intend to look  for a foreign account after this project.  We are not going to upset anyone in the bank but please treat this  as top secret and confidential.  If you are willing to assist us, contact me immediately through email  account@qatar.net Thank you and God bless,  Regards,  Dr. Amer Musa. _________________________________________________________ Gagne une  présentation du PC au PC! http://www.cnet.fr/

 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL   DEAR SIR,                           I am Mr. Steve Abell, the Branch manager in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa.On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant account in this bank belonging to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight #261 which crashed on January 31, 2000.    Though personally, I keep this information secret within myself  to enable the bank pursue its due course and clear this money from this account after it has been dormant in this bank for a very long time.   On further investigation, I found out that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot operate a dormant account hence the money is still floating and it is very easy to clear this account from this bank.   However, I want you to act as the beneficiary of this account so that the money will be released to you in your account without any further delay.   In fact, I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a bank official, we are not allowed to operate a dormant account.   Hence the reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to this bank and also present a valid dormant account for the bank to release the money into.   On this discovery, I decided to pass this information along to you for us to continue with the deal.   At this juncture, I need your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased and also present a valid dormant account for the bank to release the money into.   Upon receipt of your positive response, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to the bank.   Once you receive this letter. Kindly send me your fax and your email address for easy communication.    Best Regards,  Mr. Steve Abell

Title: REPORT
 REPORT ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. First, I want to inform you of an urgent convenience. I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am the President of the board of the bank that is dealing with you today. My name is ALEXANDRE CONTOLLI, the bank manager of the prime bank here in South Africa. I got your contact from our bank directory when i was searching for a good and reliable person to handle this confidential transaction for which I must also appoint a private email address for an arrangement. I was delighted to discover from your contact that you are a reliable and reliable person. Even if you are not interested, you can still give us your support and cooperation for this urgent and profitable business. For your support and cooperation, I decided to contact you because i expect you to contact me immediately, so that i will inform you the next step to take urgently. I have a proposal for you. On June 6th, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$5,500,000.00 (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident, leaving no will and no possible records to trace any of his supposed next of kin. This sum of US$5,500 Million is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We will employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

Title: From Tommy Thompson.
 From Tommy Thompson. Attn: Sir/Madam You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally. I am Mr Tommy Thompson, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. But I crave your indulgence and pray you view this letter as a desperate search under the mistaken belief that you can always rely on a reliable and trustworthy person for a transaction of this magnitude. A random search based on the  criteria set by the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, produced this email address. I am contacting you to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction between two or more foreign suppliers of fertilizers and pesticides and the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. We are willing to offer you 10% of the total amount USD$32,500,000.00, for your assistance in the transaction, 5% for the incidental expenses incurred during the course of the transaction, and 100% of the amount USD$32,500,000.00(USD$32,500,000.00), will be for me and my family. Would you agree to receive 5% of the total amount USD$32,500,000.00, for your indulgence? Let me first explain my motivation for contacting you, I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in South Africa, and I pray that you view it as a desperate search under the mistaken belief that you can always rely on a reliable and trustworthy person for a transaction of this magnitude. I got your contact from the South Africa Chambers of Commerce and Foreign Commerce. During our investigation and auditing in this chamber, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our foreign suppliers who died along with his entire family on 9th July 1996 in plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it on the next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours Faithfully Mr Tommy Thompson   Alternative email address: tommythompson@hotmail.com

 ATTN. PROPERLY CALLED. ATTN. DEAR SIR, I am Mr. dearard halliday, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service code of conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $18.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of the $18.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid. I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. Sincerely yours, Mr. dearard halliday

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTRAIT TRANSFER.
 URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTRAIT TRANSFER. Dear Sir, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer who died with his entire family on 25TH NOVEMBER 23RD 2004 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE. And  from his death till date nobody has come forward to claim  this money or do any further investigation about this place. The amount involved is 150M USD in respect of one of his companies which he had set up in holland before his death. The owner of this company who is also a foreigner died in plane crash, leaving little if any estate to inherit. And the banking officer here in my bank.... The existence of this deposit in my bank does not in any way indicate any  transmittable property. So my banker from now on till the time of this letter has been keeping a registry of unclaimed  deposited amounts for a very long time and no one will ever come forward to claim it.  And the banking officer told me that it was because he was a foreigner that he could not stand as next of kin to such a person.  And also because nobody is coming for this money and my banker was afraid of the  next of kin being the next of kin to my deceased client. So, from now on all the unclaimed  amounts in my bank will be donated to the tune of US$20 MILLION to the tune of 20% to the religious and humanitarian organizations respectively.  In addition to this, all correspondence from the company has been lost.  I am at a loss as to how to get the funds out of this bank without arousing too much suspicion from the security and law enforcement agencies.  Whatever the reason, I still humbly ask for your indulgence and assistance in this transaction.

Title: FROM: Mr.MATTAR ALI BIGBI
 FROM: Mr.MATTAR ALI BIGBI From: Mr.MATTAR ALI BIGBI # 19  BPMH, KANO. FASO FADAKA, JOHANNESBURG P.M.841, SOUTH AFRICA. Attn:Sir/Madam,  I am Mr.MATTAR ALI. an employee at the South Africa Mining corporation (SAMC)  who was involved in a gold and diamond importation/contract  company (GEMEX)  mis-representation in South Africa which disposed of valued securities in the sum of DOLLARS($0.000300, 000.00)  to be paid to a foreign account to avoid reporting to the government,  which our scandalous president (DR.LAURENT COOK) has ordered,  the company has since you guys been allowed to leave South Africa for good  reasons and I was especially sent to attend to this company's account since before my  graduation from the university.  On the 21st of June, 2000, my graduation from the university, I was involved in a terrible  car crash with my mother which ended up killing her and me.  I was then accompanied by my younger sister aged 5 months and she was at the  hospital with a head injury.  On the 22nd of August, 2000, we were on our way to leave South Africa with our  mother when we were passengers on a flight from Johannesburg to Abidjan.  We were stopped by the South Africa government who wanted to know  why I haven't been able to meet more of my  mother's family members except my younger sister  and myself.  I told them that it is because I am an asylum seeker  (an infidel) and a citizen of South Africa, that I  was not able to secure a valid foreign passport as it pertains to  my mother and her family.  That I was advised to surrender my passport as I am dead,  that the South Africa government has ordered that any person who operates or  who has any account in any bank which does not have a foreign account  be fined, that is until the account is emptied by the bank.  It was at this  point that I was driven to seek asylum in South Africa which I did.   On the 23rd of August, 2001, I was granted refugee status which  grants  with right to reside in the territory of South Africa for a period of  (four)years after which the right to operate a bank accounts here in South Africa shall be  handed over to the refugee.  I have since on  this account been directed to seek asylum in South Africa.   I have complied to this request and so I am relocating myself  to South Africa with my family.   I would like you to forward to me the following information:  1. Your company name, address, fax, phone and your personal fax  number for easy communication.  2. Your personal fax and phone number.  3. Your personal / official telephone and fax number.  Thanks for your cooperation. Best regards, Mr.Matthew Ali

Moreover, our ability to make arrangements for such transfer is muddied at the very last moment by the fact that we are stuck in South Africa due to our location here. More than likely, all our life chances will be lost if this money is not released immediately. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum as a reward for your co-operation , 5% will be set aside for all the expenses incurred by both parties during the process of transferring this money and the remaining 70% will be for us. Furthermore, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful transfer of this money to your account in your country. Please, I want you to furnish us with your personal fax and telephone numbers for easy and safe communication. With the transfer of this money out of South Africa, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to cover any expenses we may incure during the transfer process. Further information about this transaction will be discussed in the following paragraphs: 1. What is the difference between a bank account and a real person? 2. Can I get a visa problem free ? 3. Can my child go to a school close to where this money will be remitted? 4. Can I get a good business partner to carry out this deal? 5. Can you give me something tangible for this money?

Title: From Kurt N. Wahl
 From Kurt N. Wahl Dear friend, I am Kurt N. Wahl a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said  fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total revenue collections for the year 2000/2001 which was approved by the South Africa Mining &amp; Natural Resources Minister and approved by the President of the South Africa Government yesterday. We have decided to transfer this money to a foreign account because the approved account holder is a foreigner and his/her account is compromised by the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct. Though the actual content of the account has not been disclosed to us, we are in possession of accurate information about the account holder, which supports the claim that he is a foreigner and an account is not allowed to stay more than six years without claim. Thus, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. For your support and partnership,please reply this mail through my private mail:wahl_kurt@yahoo.com I need your urgent response. Thanks as I look forward to hear from you. Best regards, Mr. Kurt N. Wahl.

From: Ms. Paula Johnson.
 Ms. Paula Johnson. ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I know this email will come to you as a surprise, but i got your contact from the proffesional data base found in the internet[www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/africa/10/26/benin.crab.morgues.holocaust/index.html] and this is why i asked you to help me. On Monday, November 26, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, BG DAKAR,Senegal made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$40,000,000.00(Forty Million Dollars) in one of the port authorities here in Dakar Senegal. Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that the captain of this ship, Engr.Bogdan Ebadi died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/01/egyptair990.list/index.html?versionId=3&amp;url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/01/egyptair990.list&amp;src=&amp;email=beazhidi17@yahoo.co.uk&gt;&gt; On further investigation, I found out that Engr. Bogdan Ebadi died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Bogdan Ebadi did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$40,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to Senegal's law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegal Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Bogdan Ebadi so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to furnish immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I will send to you by fax or phone the text of the will.Please, do not send this email to anyone electronic, as all e-mails are from Copyright ©2000-2017 Charles Tanji

Title: We need your help.
 We need your help. Hello Dear, I know that in some corners of the internet there is unholy alliance against man because of the dark times in past. The wicked shall not prevail. This is the advice I had given to you as a matter of urgency when I prayed for assistance to you. If you are not capable to handle this, then kindly get to work immediately in order to complete the transaction. My name is Mr.Bahad Ibad, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I was sent for by my banking providers to provide a new account because of the number of defunct accounts that had been opened by some senior South African government officials or their associates. Without informing me, they had ordered all old accounts to be cloned or destroyed. This action by the South African government has caused an enormous amount of money to be lost and a lot of it is still being lost. It is only a matter of time, before this money is rolled over or deposited into a bank account of any kind. The South African government has approved the remittance of this money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account. Consequently, my decision to seek a genuine foreigner as my reliable source of information for this transaction is very important because I am a foreigner too and my sources of information are very limited. I have all the necessary legal documents that will cover my position as the next of kin to any foreign individual or company. This money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction . Please, I need your cooperation in this transaction. I have agreed to give you 30% of the total amount,75% for supporting me, while 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction. Please, I need your assistance in the following ways: 1. Provide an account to receive this money. 2. Make arrangement on how to come over to your country to receive this money. 3. Offer to sell or rent properties in your country if this money is properly transmuted into your account. 4. Offer to front an existing bank account if this money is properly transferred into your account. Five (5) days' consideration is your due from me. Please, do not undermine or jeopardise this transaction, as it is very important. If you have any other question, reply me. Please, be assured that I will be glad to provide any relevant information that will enable you understand the transaction.END OF FURTHER URGENT RESPONSE.Please, always treat this matter with utmost secrecy and secrecy, as I wait for your urgent and positive response.Please, be rest assured that I will be glad to hear from you within the next few days.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION..
 URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION.. Transfers of remittances in US Dollars, five million Five Hundred Thousand USD and Twenty Four Thousand US Dollar. I work as the Union Bank Manager in charge of Auditing and Accounting section. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of thirty four million Five Hundred Thousand USD and Twenty Four Thousand US Dollar, which we have been entitled to claim by virtue of our employment with the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Reserve Bank of Nigeria. As civil servants we are not allowed to operate bank accounts outside Nigeria, so this account was opened in with no record of the account owner. On further investigation, we found out that the account was a secret account and that the account was operated by a foreigner. We discovered that the account was only a secret account because the owner of the account is a foreigner and he did not disclose the owner of the account to us.                       We will start the first transfer with thirty four million Five Hundred Thousand USD. Upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining amount to your account.                     We will seek for your co-operation to enable us conclude this transaction in a profitable manner. Please, every thing must be on the high note as we are preparing to apply for our pension from the Federal Government of Nigeria. Now that the pension is over, we intend to lodge this fund in a bank account provided by you. If you are willing to assist us, kindly forward to my e-mail address wilson_luisa_barbo@yahoo.co.uk Yours faithfully, Martin Barbo. Master of transaction and partner. Union Bank of Nigeria.

My name is Mr Martin Mulumba I work with the South African division of Oil Sands Corporation (OPSCC) and through my position as a top official with the corporation I have the authority to order the release of some companies and individuals' accounts to our bank overseas. These accounts had been dormant since the end of the cold war/communism in the country. The accounts had been dormant since the end of the cold war/communism in the country. This has caused huge disbursements to the tune of USD$65Million in the bank alone and the accounts have been dormant since. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals. These chemicals were manufactured and supplied to some US companies and some South African companies. According to my chain of command, and based on agreement between the South African government and the US, we are being asked to compensate the US Government for the loss of life caused by the rogue government of ungrateful President Clinton.  The amount involved is (USD$65M)Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars. This money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals.  Based on agreement between the South African government and the US Government, the amount of USD$65Million I have in my custody is the result of long standing contracts which the governments of South Africa and the US executed under the former's regime. These contracts were executed under the former regime and the contracts executed were bribes and kickbacks, and some were actually made to the tune of $15Million in one instance. The contract was executed under the former regime and the contract was strongly implied by the former's regime that any contract awarded by a foreign company should be executed by a local company, which the US Government resulted in the release of several million dollars to the tune of $15Million to the tune of US$15Million to the tune of US$15Million to the tune of US$15Million to the tune of US$15Million. The former's government has vigorously protested the release of this money and has demanded that the US Government pay reparations to the former regime members who were victims of this scheme. Now, the former's hold has been won and now the US Government may be forced to release the money to the former regime members for their opprobrium, but they are not willing to do it because of the influence of the US Government in the former regime. It is against this background that I have sought your permission to have a local firm act as the beneficiary for the payment of the contract, which you granted. My suggestion to you was to receive a withholding certificate which would enable you get the money paid to you.  This is where I would like your assistance or in other words, you may be able to get paid for it.  I will start the first transfer by making a transfer payable to you for a period of 12 months, and upon maturity, I will send a reminder to you.  Upon that you will send to me the amount of the transfer payable to you, for a period of 12 months.  I will send a further notification to you by fax or telephone.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you approve the transfer to your account.   I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is totally free from risk and troubles.  It is a 100% risk and trouble free transaction.

Title: GOOD DAY.
 GOOD DAY. Dear friend, I am Mr.richard schemm a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Swiss Petroleum Corporation, Dr. Donald Evans made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,800,000.00(Ten Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Swiss Petroleum Corporation that Dr. Donald Evans died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. &gt; After further investigation, I found out that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,800,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Swiss Law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Swiss Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Dr. Donald Evans so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. MR.richard schemm.

I have a proposal for your consideration. On June 6, 1999, a foreign contractor with the South Africa  Mining Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Rmb27,500,000.00 [Twenty-seven Million five Hundred thousand  U. S. Dollars] in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa  Mining Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his  bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of Rmb27.5m is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.   According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid in two parts,  60% for you and 40% for us and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, we shall then share the percentage indicated on both sides. Should you be interested in the proposal, please send me your direct telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.

Title: FROM: Mr.Kofi Appiah  U.S and World Bank  JOB  DESCRIPTION: Dear Sir,  I am your good friend, who worked with the U.S  World Bank and Bank of Africa. I  have a proposal for your consideration. On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with  Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly  made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  eight millions three hundred thousand dollars ($8.3m) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to  his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered  from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation  that Mr.David Ameeraly died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian  Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm   from the website below: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/US100Days/12/01/world/africa/main49778.shtml  On further investigation, I found out that he died without  making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,   including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of eight million  Three Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($8.3m) is still sitting in my Bank and the   interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No   one will ever come forward to claim it. According   to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of  (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if   nobody applies to claim the fund. I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mr                                       because we cannot stand as the next of kin to a dead body.              (Pass on this mail to any reliable email account used for this mail)                                                                                 ("REMITTANCE OF $14 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS                                                                                           ?    1.We want you to open a   Bank account, as the beneficiary, so that the proceeds of this fund will be   transferred to you as the next of kin to Mr.David Ameeraly,                                                                                                                         (p.m.all) 2.We want you to provide us with your full name and   your address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and    affidavits, which will put you in place as the beneficiary. 3.We want you to inform us when you will start your next of kin. The   bank will remit this money to you as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly,                                                       If you are interested, please reply immediately to:

Title: From: James Yee.
 From: James Yee. ATTN: Sir. I am James Yee, a native of Cotonou Republic Day, I move to Johannesburg, South Africa on behalf of my colleagues from the Federal Government Negotiating Committee (FGNPC) and have agreed to present this business proposal to you. On July 8, 2000, an America Petroleum Products Company (API) offices in Cotonou, Republic of South Africa, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract body  the American Petroleum Products Company (API)  that the deposit had been declared National Bond unserviceable by the bank where the deposit is being kept.  On further investigation, I found out that the  American Petroleum Products Company (API)  has been dissolved and was in fact dissolved by the South African Government,  which is why we are here in South Africa to collect this money from the API and transfer it  directly to your bank account.  Although the law protects the integrity of the bank from such diversion, in this  instance, it is evident that the law is not in place to stop such money  being paid into your account.  As a matter of fact, the law is already on the books to arrest  such money  being paid to others.  Because of this fact, our head of department and I, along with the bank  manager, are being extremely cautious of our clients future obligations  and wants to make sure that they paid their true dues  to the bank before they will get to claim this money from the bank.  As such, our bankers,lawyer and myself, are in a  position to approve this payment to any other company that you will  provide, if you agree to help us in the following manner:  1.  Provide your bank account,  2.  Provide your bank account Name:  3.  Provide your bank account Address:  4.  Provide your bank account Zip:  5.  Provide your bank account Number:  6.

 &gt;lt;minutes_id&gt;&gt; Dear Friend, I am the manager of bills and exchange at the MONEY TRANSFER BANK. I am writing to seek your confidence in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of twenty four million five hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$24.5m) in an account  belonging to one of our customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash on the 2nd min. of feb 25,2002 in paris-  that  specifically targeted the and  other passengers on board. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release  the money unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or next of  kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed  next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Nigeria stipulates that if such money  remained unclaimed aftera year, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a NIGERIAN cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to  the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me . There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted, upon receipt of your reply. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is likely to be successful without unnecessary risk to you and that you ought to contact me on my number 00226 76 35 53 97 the next possible  opportunity. I am aware of the high profile nature of this business and  of the need for confidentiality. I shall be grateful if you could at least indicate by your telephone number where the money will be remitted .I will be with my family by your side  when the money is transferred into your account.I suggest you let me know to enable me start the process of the  fund going into your account as the next of kin to the deceased. I await your reply through my email address, please keep  this transaction as TOP SECRET and confidential. You should also protect  your personal safety by keeping door of communication firmly fixed. Yours faithfully, Mr.Mosesrod Ali.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.   So, I made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John Morrison did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of 20,000,000.00pds. and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim his funds.   According to Scottish Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Scottish Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John Morrison so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.   This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

I got your contact through national E-mail address below while searching for a trustworthy person with this foreign remittance business.

In the course of his contract, contract or assignment he over estimated the total contract sum of the bank he was doing and the contract was over invoiced by us government officials till after the completion of the contract. And the contract was executed for the sum of USD$2.5 Billion dollars. I and my colleagues in the bank did not notify any One of us, the director in charge of bank operations or the bank committe. And the contract amount USD$10,800,000.00 is still sitting in the bank account. I and my colleagues are the ones that decided to over estimate the contract sum, and we did it with the bank because I and my colleagues are the ones that designate the bank account for the benefit of the whole bank staff.

In the light of the above, I would like you to provide a alternate bank account, where the money will be transfer to. And upon receipt of your authorization for this transaction, we will arrange for the transfer of the fund to your account. And as I mentioned before, your entire card and balance of the contract funds will be transfered to your account as I have agreed to share the money, for the benefit of the entire bank staff. And for your assistance, I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a percentage of the money for your assistance or not. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. As soon as you indicate your interest to assist me, please forward to me the following information; 1.Your Full Name, Contact Address, Telephone and Fax Number 2.Your Age, Sex and Occupation, which you will provide to facilitate the transfer of the fund successfully.

BANQUE HONORAL TRUST BANQUE DEVELOPPEMENTI HONORAL TRUST BANQUE HONORAL TRUST BANQUE is the name of the country where I was born in the year 2000.I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.

Hafti made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Tunisia Petroleum Corporation that Engr. B.J. Hafti died in the plane crash On November 30, 1999, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Tunisia Petroleum Corporation, Engr.B.J. Hafti died in the plane crash  with other passengers aboaed on his plane ride from Detroit to Benin Republic on his way to attend a trade exhibition in the port city.            On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Hafti did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to the banking guidelines of my bank, at the expiration  of  (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. I now seek your permission to have this amount in my bank as an overflow effect,  to enable the new management team to secure the necessary approval and to beginto process payments which will be made to anyof your  nominated bank account then by the new management team.

 from: michael.w.wasson Dear Friend, I am Michael Wasson, Bank Manager of International Commercial Bank plc U.A.E . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jim Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at $10,000,000.00 (Ten Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jim Smith died from an auto-mobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim Smith did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of $10,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting &amp; notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for any expenses that we might incure during the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Title: Your kind attention needed !!
 Your kind attention needed !! Attn,Dearest, You are probably aware that i am in need of a foreign partner to assist me in receiving the sum of US$13.5 million which my late father kept in a bank here in dakar ad- lez. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in dakar ad- lez and i decided to involve you in this business deal. In my country, if a foreigner has a business, he must declare it as such to the bank so that the bank can contact any foreign bank account of his in his capacity as the manager of the bank, and ask for the money to be paid into his account, as the competent authority in the bank is not in agreement with the prevailing political and economic status quo in the country at the moment. The prevailing political status quo is that royals who have made up their minds to run for office in their countries. I obtained from the dakar ad- lez chamber of commerce information about your position as the manager of the bank and the amount involved. I will be sensitive towards your company because it is a British-owned company, and I cannot stand the idea of a foreigner operating a bank account in my country. I will be leaving the bank before the money gets into your account either from the foreign customer base or the government of dakar ad- lez. I have a cab card and I can transport the money to you or transfer it to any account on your behalf. For your support and partnership,please reply me to arrange for the transfer of the fund to your bank account. I will be leaving the company in two weeks and will send you my resume to you. You can contact me on my above telephone or fax number. if you are interested in this deal, please reply immediately through my email,benedict_jones@myway.com Thanking you for your anticipated response. Sincerely,  Mr. Benedict Jones.

Title: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. We the undersigned is Mr Michael Barone, Bank of East Africa, Lagos-Nigeria. I got your e-mail address from our chamber of commerce here in Africa.During our investigation and Accounting auditing in this bank, my department came across a veryvacant account in this bank.  This account had been hora ted for over a year.  Considering the gravity of the imagedecovery and the accountsite it has come to, this account has rosy a good reputation in this bank.  But alas, the account was vacant, and until his death he was the general manager, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,  and he died without posting of any beneficiary to the account.  What bothers me most is that despite the established policy of this bank, which is to retire the account to be filled by a beneficiary,  my police interrogators interrogated me on this account and after i confessed my guilt, they transferred the whole story to another bank account  without informing me.  I am in urgent need of a foreign partner with whose bank account I shall transfer the fund.  I want the account to be in any bank account which you are going to nominate, because I am 41 years old and female, I don't have any child, I am just married with two kids.  I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways:  1. To provide a bank account into which this money would be transferred to.  2. To serve as the head of the account since I am a young lady.  3. To make arrangement for the transfer of this money to a reliable foreign account which you are going to nominate.  4. To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a residential permit in your country.  5. To render account in the bank for us to share the money.  6. To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a residential permit in your country.  When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail either to verify if you can be of assistance or not.  Respectfully yours, Mr Michael Barone.

Title: CAN YOU BE SINCERE?
 CAN YOU BE SINCERE? ATTN: My name is Kalu Ndumalo, i work with the Nigerian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism. I am writing in respect of a foreign contracting company which I head. My company, on the basis of a written approval, got your name and address from the Nigerian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism. We, as a government and the Nigerian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism, now we seek your permission to have you stand as a go-between between for us and the foreign contracting company, which I head, for the purpose of transferring our dues and over-invoiced amounts through you. The amount involved is Ten Million, Two Hundred Thousand Dollars. (US$10,000.000.00 ) of a kind which we intend to put in a consignment for safe keeping for a short while in a bank here in Nigeria. We intend to use your company's name to transfer our fund abroad, but we fear for our personal safety as we have not been heard from in Nigeria since the beginning of this business. If you are willing to quietly look for a trustworthy foreigner for this business, who will also help us, and also help us fill in all the necessary documents which will put you in place as the Foreign Contractor, we would like you to get back to us as soon as possible for more arrangements. I have secretly discussed this matter with the Head office and they are willing to approve this payment to you as the beneficiary of the claims of the fund. Please, if you are willing to do this deal with us, let me know as soon as possible so that you will get to work immediately.As soon as you get this fund into your account, you are requested to deliver it to me on my arrival here in Nigeria for further processing and transfer to your bank account. Please, if you are willing to work with us, send your completed cheque to: ndumalo_kalu@yahoo.co.uk Thank you. Sincerely. Kalu Ndumalo.

 TOP HERECHA. From:MARTIN BYRON I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am still in active service with the Defence staff of the Federal Government of Nigeria praciton and am in charge of the financial transactions within the Department of finance where i work. In  my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15.5 million  (Fifteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account linked to one of our foreign customer who died in plane crash plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the money unless somebody applies for claim as next of kin to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with the  deceased at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is because of this that I and other staff in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the treasury as   unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after a period of  (3-4)threeYEARS, it will be referred  to the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this ?  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a NIGER cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement has been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 789i,15  Téléphonez vous disponible en e-mail; E-mailez-le pratique dans un   firmamente de ce web registre du web.

I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation so that we can assist each other to achieve. My name is goldinwoo e-mail, the first and only female member of the female FMVIMP. In the course of our ordinary business in the bank, my department came across a very large sum of US$18.2Million (Sixteen Million, Two Hundred and Twenty Two Million United States Dollars).   This money originated from a faulty contract awarded by one of our foreign customer (a Chinese company) who died along with his entire family in a plane crash on the 1st Oct 2001 in paris that almost took the whole lives of the pasengeres on board.   After the death of the customer, his entire family was transported to  Mt Chin Kingdom and lodged in one room.   Soon after, his  next of kin came to claim his money claiming that he  owed them this money for unclaimed contract goods and/or service rendered to him by other foreign companies.   This made my department to notice an urgent need for a foreign partner to unload this money on behalf of the entire family members thus saving us trouble in the  future.   On the discovery of this money in our bank, we authenticated the money to the tune of US$20.2 Million.   This money has been unclaimed by any of his next of kin.    Consequently, we and our bank share bureau agree to share the money in the ratio of 70% for us and 30% for you.   I have the authority of my bank share bureau to propose that will be 50% for you in respect of your assistance.  I am writing this letter to solicit for your cooperation to enable us see this deal through. It will be very beneficial to both of us.    Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

 Please, get back to me. From: Carlos James Escondido, CA. TEL:873-7636159                                                    We want to assure you that all our Father's do, we have always been careful and cautious to ensure that when we decided to bond with a foreign partner, it was with his permission and we have always kept a low profile due to the fact that we are still in active civil war here in Cote d'Ivoire where we are now. In the light of all these woes, we are with you now in faith and hope that you will not disappoint us. We are the first and the only surviving two families from the war in the land. We are farmers, we work in farms and we have made a bussiness out of it. My father was killed by the rebels in the war and though he was a war dame, she was not spared and was killed by the rebels. Her husband, if we can call him that, was a really big business man, he was a member of the rebel forces that attacked our farm and also a business leader. Many of his business associates and myself were left behind because the war is not over yet and the warring parties still exist in the war. As the eldest of three children, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a foreign loan partner with whom I can safely transfer the money I have in the bank for investment. I have made several arrangements that will ensure that my younger sister and I will have sufficient funds to make us travel to a bank in a foreign country for the transfer. Please, be informed that the Bank affairs officer of the bank here in Cote d'Ivoire have advised that you and your sister should transfer the money to a foreign account because the money is in us and we don't want them to know about it. The bank is aware that we are politically from the warring parties and despite of the warring parties lives, but they do not know the true nature of the war. They only know that we are from the warring parties. I don't know whether to panic or laugh at this news but we will be attending her funeral here in Cote d'Ivoire after we have made the transfer to a foreign account. Please, be informed that the transfer will be effected to your account within ten to fourteen (14) working days from the day we received this news from the bank.

 I get your email address I get your email address              From James Salazar                  I am James Salazar, Bank manager of Diamond Bank here in South Africa.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished along with his entire family on flight 890 with the whole passengers on board. Since the demise of this customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his bank. The banking and financial law of South Africa guarantees your right to know the next of kin of any person who is deceased. The  account was opened with the Bank without a hitch and the beneficiary was oversea before his death. The amount involved is US$15M, fifteen million, united states dollars. At this rate, it will take us two weeks to finalize this transaction. You will be credited with the said amount in the bank upon your approval. We will however leave out the finer details when we reach a conclusion to this deal. I have secretly discussed this matter with the manager of the bank who I must involve in order to see this business thru. Be rest assured that I will be of tremendous assistance to you at the conclusion of this transaction as I have every intention of using my position in this bank to champion this transaction with you. Could you be a willing party to this business? If yes, kindly furnish me with your details for easy comunication. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used in the deposits. I have decided to let the bank do this deal with you and use my position to facilitate the onward transfer of the money to any account nominated by you. At this juncture, it is my desire to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this business, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratifications,while 5% of the total sum will be set aside for expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process and the remaining 70% will be for me, after the successful transfer. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring this whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible by enclosing the following information: 1. Your private and confidential telephone number and fax number, 2. Your address, 3.Your personal fax number, depending on your preference. You should also include your private telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Awaiting your urgent reply.

This sum of US$35,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian laws, at the expiration of  6 (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Frank Jonas so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.

Title: URGENT REPLY PLEASE.                                           RE: TRANSFER OF USD15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS                       RESPONSE URGENTLY, STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; IMPORTANT; I am Mr. ABHINAV SIME, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as TOP SECRET because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Fifteen Million United States Dollars ($15.2M) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$15.2M) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you. Be informed that a Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has recently approved for the payment of the contract which covered the farm buildings and farm equipment retirement of plants and farm implements under the management of the South Africa Department of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources to any foreign firm/individual. This grant has been made conditional on your showing up for the claim by the due date as indicated in the application form. In the light of the above, I was persuaded to move out from South Africa to South America, by which I mean to move to a foreign account and not be directly connected to the South Africa Government through my position in the Federal Government. I have secured from the Federal Government that you should be provided with the most basic banking details to facilitate the transfer of this money to any account you will donate to the fund. For your support and partnership,please reply immediately through the above private email address. Thanking you in anticipation of your co-operation. Best regards, Mr. Sime Sime.

Title: Urgent Reply
 Urgent Reply Hello, I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal, I Got your e-mail address in an internet search  after I prayed over it and I believe that you are worthy enough to handle this urgent business proposal. I am Dr Maryam Abacha, the legal practitioner to late Mr.ajafar mandel  ( an oil  salesman /contractor) who died on board the gondola  plane crash at Abidjan -Ivory Coast with the other passengers on board. He was on a six-month contract with the  South African Mining Corporation (SAMC).  On the day of our departure from Johannesburg, we were supposed to commence our six-month contract in  April, this is why we had to cancel it before we left for South Africa. And  on the same note, we cancelled the contract last November.  Upon our arrival in South Africa, we were told  that our contract was over and for us to go their way as the  next of kin to Mr.ajafar mandel, because we are from Nigeria, but  on further investigation, it was proved  that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.  Further investigation  revealed that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his  bank deposit paperwork in my bank.  This sum of US$6.6m (Six Million Six Hundred  Dollars)is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According  to the Nigerian banking law, at the expiration  of  (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the  money.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand as the  next of kin to Mr.ajafar mandel so that the fruit of this old man's labor will  not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that  the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in  place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and  notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you by the attorney  for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business.   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the  Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction. If you are immediately via this  email address immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and relevant documents that will help you understand the  transaction.  Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  this subject.

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. This is to solicit your assistance in a business venture. I know this email will come to you as a surprise, With due respect, trust and humility I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be of immense mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and Accounting auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 12 NOVEMBER 21ST 2003 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590 ] with the whole fund [US$15,850,000.00] kept in his account that ran into millions of dollars. When our bank contacted him he replied that he died without a written will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. We further discovered from his own bank records that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. We further investigated and discovered that his nearest kin in the country is a farmer and he was killed in the crash. We further discovered that the farmer and his family left no WILL and all attempts to trace the next of kin was fruitless. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that the farmer did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,850,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of 6 (6) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming up to claim the fund. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that it will be sent to you as the next of kin to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement purposes. Then, upon receipt of your positive response, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

On further investigation, I found out that Mr. Richard Moss died in the plane crash of 31 July 1999[with EgyptAir Flight 990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it  yourself via the website below: http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html on further investigation, I found out that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are willing to assist, please call or fax me immediately so that we can discuss in detail the steps to be taken to ensure that we succeed. If you are willing to give us a very strong assurance, please give us your contact number immediately so that we can send you more details on how we intend to finalize this transaction. We wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours faithfully, Mr. Jeffery F.Moss.

However, in desperate need of foreign partners like you, I have decided to seek for your assistance through this medium, so that we can present you as the foreign partner of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family at the plane crash of On September 11, 2001 in which at least 214 passengers and crew were on board. My late client died in a private hospital here in Cape Town, South Africa, and my father was one of the top echelon tansor in the African National Congress (ANC). He died in a private hospital here in Cape Town, South Africa, and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the President of the ANC tansor group here in South Africa. He and his family were assonated with their families to Australia, due to the peace keeping powerplay between the warring factions of the warring factions in this part of africa. He died in a private hospital here in Cape Town, South Africa, and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the President of the ANC tansor group here in South Africa. He and his family were assonated with their families to Australia, due to the peace keeping powerplay between the warring factions of the warring factions in this part of africa. After his death, I was very much disappointed and disappointed. This account was secured by me and my family from a deceased person and since my father was a very influential person within the ANC and the Indian National Congress before his death, he was expected by our oppressors to transfer his fortune made in commodities to our country in abidjan because this money is to be transferred to overseas as hostages. His account was defaced and vandalized. I have gone to the bank to notify you about this money, and I have informed them that I will like you to act as the foreign partner of my late client because he was a foreigner and my present location is not safe for me to travel hence I am seeking for your assistance. I have deposited the sum of US$9,200,000,00 (nine million, twenty six thousand United State Dollars) in your account. I deposited the money into your account with this International Banks, which is why I have gone to the bank to notify you about this money. I will be grateful if you could receive this money into your bank account for safe keeping for a while, but I do not want this money to go into your account untill I hear from you again. I will tell you the exact amount when I hear from you. At this juncture, it is only fair that I inform you that this transaction is risk free.  You are to contact me immediately if you are interested in this deal. Note that the economics here does not matter as much as the fact that the arrangement is made for the transfer. You will never know the difference between the money and the commodities, as we are discrimination free. I will gladly give you more details upon such time as you request. Please, always treat with the absolute confidentiality please.  You should also keep in mind that this transaction is risk free.

I am the only son of late Mr. and Mrs. Bill Allen. My father was an influential rich farmer in my country and was murdered by our neighbor, the evil president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo. My mother was an unsuccessful business woman and she was murdered by the mob that ruled my country at the end of last year's murder. Before the death of my father, he had entrusted a large sum of money to a Japanese businessman which he deposited in a bank here in Nigeria and the manager of the bank, Mr. Kazuyuki Terada, also a Japanese, was murdered in the hostage crisis.  My mother's and my Father's secret bank account was the largest deposit in the bank in my country and he had intended to transfer this money to another foreign account, where it could be invested safely. He was killed by the mob. My father's safe haven was on an island in the middle of the island where he deposited the money. Unfortunately, my mother died when I was a baby and since then my father's murderers have been relentless. They have killed his family members and even tried to poison him with cyanide.  My mother told me once that my father's safe haven was deposited in a bank here that he deposited the sum of $10.5 million (Ten million five hundred thousand United State Dollars) in the bank.                                                                       The bank now has this money and has called me to come over and claim it, since my father's killers are not allowed to operate bank accounts here, and my mother died when I was a baby.             As the second wife of my late husband, I am becoming increasingly worried, and I have secretly called you to come over and claim this money. Please, I am in desperate need of your assistance, as I am afraid I will not last for long. I am not allowed to operate bank accounts here, and this is my only option to transfer this money abroad hence I decided to ask for your assistance. Please, I need your assistance as my life here is no living legal repose,This is my only option left, to remain under the protection of the security company, because I do not know where I am going to get a valid international passport to operate an account in, yet, I do not want this money to go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. My life here is no good, and my only hope is that a reliable foreigner will come over and open a bank account here so that I can transfer this money over to any account in any country he will approve, as it will be in his interest to do so, as the account is his life.                                                                                         I am willing to offer you 20 percent of the total sum as compensation for your effort, while the remaining 75 percent will be mine, and I will use my position here to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account, where it will be safe for me to invest. Please, reply immediately to this email Only You!@imnada.com send your reply to me too, so that I can give you more clear explanations details and details of this transaction. I will be grateful if you can come over to my country to further enhance your experience here in life. I hope to conclude this business within fourteen-teen days.

DOLLARS) which we found worth of with the sum of U.S. $15.5 million in a bank here in Johannesburg, South Africa.We are suppliating you with the hope that you will  help us to transfer this money to your account for our personal use,because the original owners of the bank have not been paid their rightful dues and the fund can not be paid in to the bank account we are gonna appoint for our personal use.

Title: URGENT PLEASE. PLEASE GET IN TOUCH.
 URGENT PLEASE. PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. Mr.Vivian Karef Abidjan,Ivory Coast. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vivian Karef, the younger son of late Mr.J.W.Karef, a wealthy and influential Cameroonian politician who died suddenly on 12th May 2004.  He died as a result of a heart attack, also known as cardiac arrest or asphyxia  as it is more commonly referred to in the medical community.  Unfortunately, my father  suffered a very tragic and to say the least, tragic loss to the community.  My mother died when I was a baby and since then my father took me so special.   I am a boy of pure and innocent blood, and my father always believed that if he did not, I would not be the next of kin to my late father.   As a result of this, we were forced to flee our homeland and seek asylum in  Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast.   From Abidjan we traveled to Frankfort-Kandaba, the capital city of the  Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, where we stayed for a short while before  we decided to seek asylum.   We are now staying in the drawing room of the hotel here in the  capital city because our lives would be in danger there.   It is for this reason that we are seeking your assistance to have you come over to our  country to further our education and to secure a valid foreign bank account  where we would remit this money before it is forfeited to the government treasury.   We are not afraid of death hence we have called for our deathbed burial, as the  parents of our late father told us that we must seek for a godless heaven or  eternal damnation.   From the hotel here we have been to the cemetery, but all the  graves were filled with our dead fathers money.   As a matter of fact, the cemetery is now deserted and deserted  for the dead.   We are not going to lie down here, we have no place to call home.   We have called for an urgent meeting of the local elders, the Spiritual &gt;Branch of the  Methodist Episcopal Church, and the president of the local branch to  discuss urgently on how we can transfer this money out of the cemetery  and into the accounts of the branch of the Methodist Episcopal Church in  abidjan.   We are not taking any risks, this is not a gamble, this is a  legal and registered investment.   We are very much indebted to you as we were indebted to your company  for the money we are holding in the bank, but we cannot stand to a  company account and be run by our own men, hence we are  asking for your support, for we will like you to provide us with  an account with which we can transfer this money.   We will like you to give us 30% of the overall money for your assistance,  5% for any expenses that may befall us during the transaction,  10% for the charity of any charity that we may inure to your charity and  the remainder for our spiritual and moral development.   If you are willing to help, we would appreciate it very much but  we would not want you to disclose this project to anyone.   We are ready to meet with you in your... private room, but we must first  clear off some capital before we can invest any more.   We have put up the deposit of the money we have in cotfinally we clear it off.   Please note that these matters should be between you and the bank  so that you can immediately inform us of any other suitable bank   for this money, as we have requested for a reputable bank account where the  money will be remitted.    Please, get in touch with  me immediately so that we can proceed with the transfer.   Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free, as the  filiation of this transaction is subject to all necessary clearance  from all governmental authorities including from the bank itself.   Regards, Mr. Vivian Karef.

Title: FROM JAMES BRYUM.
 FROM JAMES BRYUM. ATTN.Sir. I am Mr James Byrum, the Auditor General of the prime  bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent  business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, a gold  ingot/cadmium  mine in Kruger, South Africa, became  open to the public. This mine had no known operator and no known  next of kin. No other person knows about this gold ingot/cadmium mine, no  other person has ever operated a mine in the past or will in the future. The owner of this  company is a foreigner, and a South African can not operate a gold  ingot/cadmium mine. This is the reason why I wanted to locate any  person or company  who could help me. I am not contacting you as a foreigner because  this is the tax jurisdiction here in South Africa and a person with no  known assets and no known next of kin can not stand as next of kin  to a foreigner. I am contacting you as a foreigner because this  is the reason why I am contacting you. I am attaching a typed  letter of application to  apply for and I would like your confidential assistance to  receive this money to your account. Please, I need your cooperation to  secure this fund into your account, as the account administrator of this  company.  I will be interested in any bank account in your country or any account  in any bank in  your country, you can be assured that this money will be  intact pending my physical arrival here to commence  this transaction. Please, if you are not capable to handle such  sum of money kindly return the money to  the  bank, otherwise I will pay the bank attorney for  the change of ownership. Please, immediately I hear from you  again. I am sure that  you are  capable to  handle this amount of money. In fact, I would even go as far to say that you are   capable  to  handle  this amount of money  if you are capable. However, I am assuring   you that  you would be compensated   for your  outstanding  balance in  this  transaction   in  the manner                                                                                                          ....NOTHING WILL BE HELD AGAINST YOU FOR  TRANSFER OF  THIS  MONEY THROUGH  A  COMPANY   OF  OUR CHOICE?  When we received  this information, we immediately made   arrangements  to come over to  your  country  to  share the  money. But,  unfortunately,   there  is  no  way that  I can invest  this amount of money in a  firm in your country  at this  stage  of  the  process as the    company is  not yet        The  directors of the  company  are   currently  on vacation  leave  and   there  is a  problem  in  their  country  with  the  government  of  South Africa  for  the  transfer of  this amount  of  US$15Million  of  US$15Million.  The government of South African  ruled president  Nelson Mandela  is  currently on vacation and  the government of South Africa  is  currently  writting a new law  that  will   clean  him  up  after the  next  biennium  (                                      The NEW  law will   for the first time  allow a citizen of South Africa  to open a bank account in any bank in  any  country;  and  thereafter,  the  account owner shall  be paid  the  amount of  US$15Million  that  will be left in the  account  after a  transfer;   this  is the  reason why we  have  been  disappointed  many  times  since  the last  transfer;  we  will  be  very happy to  listen  to  your  urgent  reply;  we  will  be  willing  to  help you  to  receive  this

Title: My Confidential Business Appointment
 My Confidential Business Appointment FROM THE DESK OF: DR JACKSON DAVIS JR. ATTN: President/CEO.                                        ;PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL.                                     I am DR JACKSON DAVIS JR. a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.                     I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills amounting to US$36M (Thirty Six Million United State Dollars)in the form of International Commercial Cash (ICCC) payments made to us by a foreign supplier, that is why we decided to over-invoiced the supplier and over-invoiced the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources (DoM).                    Now the supplier has been paid his agreed-upon share and the balance of US$32M (Twenty Two Million United State Dollars)is still sitting in the Department Of Mining &amp; Natural Resources (DoM).                       I decided to seek a solution to this acrimonious issue with the view to transfer this money to any foreign bank account you may provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction by way of providing the bank account where the money will be transfered for safety and subsequent disbursement since we are still in the active process of disbursing this money out. The proposal of this arrangement is occasioned by the fact that the client still remains the sole owner of the account and the account has no other beneficiary and he has been declared bankrupt several times over the years.  It is only a foreigner who can come up with the funds to make this claim but my job is now done and I got your important information during my search.  The amount involved is $36M (Thirty Six Million United State Dollars)which I am willing to part with in your name if you agree to my terms.  I have agreed to give you 20% of the total amount for your immediately assistance as compensation for your effort /partnering.  I am sure that this arrangement is going to be of mutual benefit to both parties.  If you are interested, kindly get back to me immediately through my alternative e-mail box .  Thanks and God bless, thanks and God bless.  Best regards,  DR JACKSON DAVIS  Alternative e-mail address:jackson_dennist@tiscali.co.uk

Title: Your kind attention required.
 Your kind attention required. Dear Sir, I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation in the transfer of US$350 Million dollars (Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) to your nominated account. This fund was derived from gold and diamond sales which were taking place in Nigeria and the country was gripped by political violence. As the eldest son of the late president Sani Abacha, I got your contact through the news media and proceeded to solicit for your urgent co-operation and assistance to claim this money. I will gladly give you 25% of the total fund while the remaining 70% will be for my investment in your country. Consider my situation is desperate and my need for assistance to flourish. I write you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to enable my Dawr-e-in-charge be convinced to authorize the transfer of this money to your account. If you are willing to co-operate with me, I will appreciate it very much, but if you are not, it will be under the police watch. I have told you the story before but I hope you will not betray me. The Story: On July 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500, 000.00(Fourteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in the bank,Osaka,  Nigeria. Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were abortive. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,500, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an individual to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the bank's chairman guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

From: kone_pui@atlas.cz Dear Friend, My name is Mr.Kone Pui, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP). ICEP is charged with the responsibility of sourcing bank accounts for individuals or companies in Africa and Asian regions with accounts that have been dormant for a very long time. I got your contact through my personal search to see if you could assist but upon further investigation, I discovered that you are an international business person and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. I am contacting you because of an urgent transfer of funds involving up to $9.5 million United States dollars. This amount was generated as a result of over invoicing of contract awarded for the construction of the Hada World Trade Center (WWTC) and the World Trade Center Complex. The contract was executed by a foreign company, and the contractor's salaries and bonuses were paid to the foreign contractors. The contract was delivered to our local branch. Upon delivery to our branch, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we decided to change our minds and decided to send a reminder to his forwarding address but got no reply either from his bank or the post office. After a month, we sent a reminder again and finally we discovered from his contract agents at the U.S. Department of State that the contract had been executed, and the contractors had been paid their statutory entitlements. After further investigation, I found out that the contract had been scope out and that the original contractor died without leaving aRANDOMER to claim the funds hence I decided to change the way this money is being made. I got your contact through my personal search and after I concluded my personal search, I discovered that you are a foreigner too. So I decided to pick someone in your country who will be capable and willing to work with me on this transaction. And so, I am willing to share the money in the following proportions, 30% for you and 60% for me. Please, I want us to work this out and to be absolutely sure of our success before investing our part of the money in your country as a result of your expert advise and assistance. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm it directly or by a Consignment to your account, on your assurance that you will not change your mind to cheat or disappoint me when the funds hit your account. Meanwhile, you might be interested to know that in the course of carrying out our assignment in this bank, we discovered that our bank account in that bank where the money is now deposited is managed by a foreigner, and as such, the beneficiary of the account is a foreigner too.  In other words, the amount involved is $34M USD, and we have agreed to share the money in the following proportions, 30% for you and 60% for us. To enable the immediate transfer of this money to any foreign account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will send to you the text of the application which you will send to the bank account of which you will become the next of kin. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your's faithfully, Mr.KONE PUI

Title: business proposal
 business proposal ATTN:President/Director. I am Mr. david son, Bank Manager of Gold orushar. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 10000. 000 US Dollars (twenty five million US Dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our customers who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in plane crash at Egirin River in Bangkok, Thailand. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in orushar stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. In view of this, we now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the deceased customer so that the money will be telesd by cable car to your house since the money is in US dollars and we will be remitting this money into your account in your country. And if you agree to our demands, we will provide a cable car or another car to carry this money to your house where we will use it for investment purpose such as Real Estate purchase or to further secrete the fund. At the conclussion of this transaction, you will be given 25%, 70% for your help and services, while 5% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle complaints from any of your family. Please, under no circumstances will you get into any kind of bind since this money is for investment purposes and you should treat this transaction with strictly confidential for the safety of the life of the bank manager and the institution that we now find ourselves in. Certainly you will not jeopardize this arrangement as we are in ambitious search for a foreign partner to assist us in this venture. And if you are willing to entertain any doubts, then kindly get to me immediately so that we willforsee your next of kin.Please note that I have remitred $10,000,000,00 from this bank alone for this particular purpose.However,I shall insist that you send back to me this mail whether you are interested or not so that I will arrange for the transfer to your account.Please, when you get this mail, do not destroy it as it will make me sick to return to my country for fear of going through the same experience in future.As soon as I get your positive response, I shall provide you with more details on the operation.Please, your highness�sssssssure,, I pray you keep the mess to yourself, as I expect your most private mail ever since I heard from you.

 INVESTMENT &gt;From The Desk Of Mr Andi Bali Sani. Manager, Bank Of Africa One of the heads of operations at the Foreign Exchange Desk In The Bank Of Africa , Dakar Senegal. I am Mr Andi Bali Sani, the Manager in charge of the Foreign Exchange Desk Here in the Bank Of Africa . In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 25 million US dollars(Twenty-five Million US Dollars) Only  in an account that belongs to one of our customers who died along with his entire family in November of 2001 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in Senegal stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Asshiper of the law in this country is not permitted to operate a bank account or open any bank account in Senegal without a legal dispensation, hence we are in need of a foreign partner whom we can trust to act as next of kin to this deceased customer. We the officials in my department and the Bank are of the same mind and we agreed that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the transaction, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my officers.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the agreement. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free and you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within sevento nine banking days, after you apply to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased customer.  When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail. You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy communication.

Title: From Mr.Francis J. Tayu.
 From Mr.Francis J. Tayu. &gt;From Mr.Francis J. Tayu. Paradiso Island,  Lagos-Nigeria. Dear Friend. My Name is Mr.Francis J. Tayu, a native of Dahomey, Nigeria, but now residing in South Africa on political asylum. I got your contact through my personal search in the government  directory. I am an executive accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. I am writing following the stunning  discovery of a $15.4 Million  Securities account in our bank in their bank here in South Africa.  By virtue  of my  position as a civil servant  (Parastatals) and  member of the Committee on Audit  (C.A.N.M). We discovered this  account  while inspecting other accounts  in the bank  and  we  decided to close it  down  immediately   to save  us  time  and  pain. It will be interesting to  listen to  you  report back on  your  findings  on the  Internet.   I   discovered an account  belonging  to  a  Congolese  businessman  who died with his entire family on the 8th  of December, 1998  in a plane crash.  Although,  no   other person knows about this account  , we  decided  to close  this transaction   because  we  don't want this money  to go  into the pockets of some corrupt government officials  and  some  business  people.  The account  was  to be used  for the   purchase of  land  and  for  the   establishment of  a new  company  here in  South Africa  as  a   next of kin.  We  agreed that   the fund  would be  transferred    to any   foreign  account  that    you will  solicit  from  us as    the  beneficiary  to be  paid. So far,  no  one has come to claim  this money and  we want this money to  be  immediately  paid  into  the  account  of  any   foreign  person who provides the     account number   of  bank   where we   want  the money to  be  paid to any   foreign  person who   provides  the   account number  to be paid. So far, no  one has come to claim  this money and  we  wanna know  you    will    act  as   next of kin    to the  deceased person;  we  also   wanna know   what  your  needs  as     profit   from this  transaction  ;  What we  want  from you  is  to  provide  us  with the  information    need  in   such  a way that    the  bank  will  arrange for the transfer   of this  money to  any  account   of  your  choice    and  never  let you  down  in  this  business  ;  You shall  be  given  10% of the  total  amount  for your effort  and  input   during the   transaction; and  5%  for  any  expenses  you  might  incure during  the  transfer  process. And  if you find  any  dead body  during this  transfer  operation,   please   report it immediately to  the  bank  account   where the money  shall  be  paid. And be rest assured  that  the  manager   of the bank    will approve   all correspondence regarding  this      subject matter. You shall  be  given   overnight   responce  in   which  you are to  remain  in   the  bank   account   until   the  time  when  you  will  be able to approach   the bank   directly  for  the  transfer  of the   remaining    ( $12,500,000.00     thousand dollars   a  day  ) to your  consideration   account  in   your country  ;  You shall  be  given  free of   all   expenses   you might  incure during  this  process.

 TRUST. From:Chris Adriaan Manager, AMPCA,  African Development Bank (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. Dear Friend I am Mr.Chris Adriaan, the managing director and senior auditor of the African Development Bank (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the    Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$15,500,000.00(Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in   my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a   month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract   employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31,1999, (an EgyptAir Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were   fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,500,000.00 and the interest it generates is enough for me to live off for a while, since I work in the bank. I offered him 20% of the total sum for his effort and cooperation, and 5% has been set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during this transaction. On this discovery, all bank correspondence was suspended, documents and all. After further investigation, I found out that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sad development made me to realize that it is very easy to set up a company in a   country, move the money to a foreign account and avoid all scrutiny from governments and   Money Laundering agencies. Using the information I gathered from the Money Laundering Agency, I am in a position to make the payment of this money into any account nominated by you. On this discovery, we ended up putting this money in a private account nominated by you for safety and security reasons. I will be happy if you can help me receive this money into your account for safe keeping. I will appreciate it very much. Please contact me as soon as you receive this mail via my private e-mail box. Do not forget to include your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Thanks and God bless. Sincerely, Mr. Chris Adriaan.
