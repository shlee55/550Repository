Kerala Police Commissioner M.S. Olusegun Obasanjo has given to me assurance that the funds will be paid to him or her within the next 14 banking days. This can be confirmed from the fact that the diary kept by Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo in our bank has been confiscated. This is because I have filed a notice in the BANK REGIMEAL OF MY INTEREST to claim the money, as it is against our policy to allow foreigners claim accounts in our bank especially in Middle East and Africa. I want you to act as the next of kin to Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo or his next of kin as the beneficiary so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. The money can be paid to you either by Western Union Money Transfer or Bank Transfer if you agree with my proposal. Either way, it will benefit both of us as the money will be paid into your account or you can transfer the money to any destination of your choice as its for investment purpose, as I am not going to manage much of the business in some months as I am going to be undergoing treatment for cancer of my liver. I have decided to give you 20% of the total amount for your efforts and intuition as I have decided to invest the money on real estate in your country. I have also decided to give you 5% of the total amount for any expenses that may arise from the transaction since I am sure that you will be of immense help to me. You can contact me through this email address:&lt;kannadams@yahoo.com&gt; For now, we will be happy if you can receive the money through my email above as we are still in business competition to get this fund. Please, if you can be of any much help in this regard, reply me with this email address which will enable me give you more details on how to get the money and also give you more details on how to make the payment on your behalf. For your assistance when you receive the money, I will want you to attach your name to this application as the beneficiary as Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo or an immediate immediate relation to him. I am truly sorry that I have caused any inconvenience in this transaction. I hope that you can understand, as I will be very glad to hear from you soon. Regards, Mr. Kannadams M.S.O.

Eldest Brother joined forces with me in the fight against Corruption and cronyism in the oil industry. He gave me the sum of $2Million (Two million two hundred and eighty Two Thousand United Stated Dollars) which is one hundred and Twenty-two Million Two Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars. This money was deposited as family valuables in the Bank using my name as the beneficiary. The money was deposited, and code-named 'DEPOSITED' because it was deposited using the formal banking method. During the course of the struggle, I got the sum of $2million (Two million Two hundred and eighty Two Thousand US Dollars) transferred into my name. The money was deposited and code-named 'CONFIDENTIAL' because it was deposited in a security company for investment purposes. This transaction was  executed under the agreement that if I am successful in getting the money out of the country, then the money will be shared between us of equal shares. The actual number of the dollars is (Two million Two hundred and Fifty Two Thousand US Dollars). The real number is (Two million Two hundred and Fifty Six Thousand US dollars). In consideration of the fact that I have just declared bankruptcy and my assets are all forfeit to the bank, I have agreed to give you 20% of the total money. To enable the immediate transfer of this funds to you at the end of the conflict-free transaction, you must apply first to the bank as the beneficiary of the funds, i.e. My Bank and you have to apply to the Security Company as the owner of the funds. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free, and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements has been made for the transfer.

Draymond Green has now signed a one-year deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder worth US$22 million dollars. As stated above, the money was deposited by his agent and was waiting to be claimed by his client when he died of a heart attack in April 2007. It is sad to say, that all attempts to locate the owner of the funds have come to naught, as the funds lie in a security company in Europe. As they are undergoing due process of transfer I have been directed by my client to look for a foreigner with a private bank account who can assist me to claim the funds and subsequently utilise the money for the benefit of the family of my late client, as according to the law of my country, the money will revert to the ownership of the security company should I not succeed in locating the owner of the funds once I have claimed them. With my position as a Banker in the Finance and Accounts section of a private bank (a member of the Board of Directors) I have the power to influence the transfer of this money to any foreigner that'll be his next of kin as all modalities has been perfected by me in your favour. All I require is your honest cooperation in this regard. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. To enable the immediate transfer of this money to you, you must apply first to the Security Company in Europe as the beneficiary/next of kin to the deceased with a written application that I will send to you, along with your private Telephone and fax numbers for easy and effective communication and location where you want the money to be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of your application. I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Please, treat as urgent.

FAIRFIELD, N.Y. -- A Fairfield man was arrested Saturday, July 26, 2009, for allegedly plotting to blow up the New York Stock Exchange. According to authorities, Nikita Khodyzkikh, Jr. made four separate calls to the New York Stock Exchange, making three different numbers of calls in succession. On December 6, 2009, he made a call to the New York Stock Exchange, making three separate calls, but one of them was answered by the security company and he was arrested without making any movement on the third call. On the 4th call, he made a different number of calls, but both of them were answered by the security company. According to authorities, he made a fourth call, but both of them were answered by the security company. On January 6, 2010, he made a fifth call and this time it was answered by the security company. According to authorities, he made a sixth and final call and this time the calls were answered by the security company. On January 16, 2010, he made a call and this time it was answered by the security company. During this period, he made at least one call to the security company, but all calls were lost because he made them all at once.

I guess this is the only real surprise of this article, but I'm not sure who the author is. I mean, I know that he has a name, but I don't know his real name. I mean, I know that he has made a big deal out of his identity, but I don't know his true name either. I mean, I know that he has made a lot of money, but I don't know his full name. And I don't know if you know this but if you don't support him or his ideas, he will find a way to make all the money he made in one go-the money he made in one go-with the help of loan sharks and such, he made a lot of money on his first trip to France and bought all the expensive items for his trip, like a private jet,a state yacht and a helicopter. Now that he has been a prisoner for a few months, and with the help of some people he has been able to move out, he has been able to purchase all this stuff with money he made on the first trip to France. But he still has a hell of a lot of it, and he will use his own part of the money to hire private security companies and make a killing all around the world for several months until he gets released. Then he will come over to meet with you and you will pay for the security of his fund and items that he left behind for you. And we both will take turns depositing the money in your account and then we can collect our shares and give to charity organizations and the like around the world.

GRIT-FOURTH: WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS?                                                                   (ATTENTION: ANTISPAM.) Dear Sir/ Madam, As you may know, the internet was invented and is still being developed by  the US Government, but it was not made for the sole purpose of  communication. The purpose of the internet is to facilitate the exchange of information, ideas and ideas  between people all over the world. However, the internet has  become a great tool for perpetrating  corruption and mass murder. It has become a great production line for  weapons of mass destruction, drugs, and evil. It has become a  breeding ground for hatred and murder. It has become a  battlefield in the conflicts throughout the world. It has become  a battlefield where innocent lives are lost daily. The world is  full of pain and sorrow. But one thing that the internet has taught me is  that there is no value unless you give it a reason to exist. I  have given the internet's full credit and 9/10 in the rankings. Now, it is my turn to give thanks for the life I have  lived. I have lived a life of a life of great honor and  privilege. I have been privileged to have had the opportunity to serve  the world as a whole. However, my present situation is not sustainable. I  have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of  medical treatment available and now has set me up for death. The only hope for my survival is to  have a donor willing to take me as his only, and I want you to do me a favor and  donate the money you will take for me and my medical expenses. My chance of survival is  very remote. The doctor told me that it will not survive more than 4  weeks. There is a need for you to do me a favor and give me a chance to recuperate. I want you to do as I am  recommending, that you would like me to donate the money you will  take for me, but there is a catch, that you have to give me 30% of the total  money for me to be able to take you for me. I have decided to give you 30% because I don't want to  lose the money I have taken. What I want you to do, is to provide me with your full names and address so that I can send  you to a foriegn account where I would deposit this money for your reimbursement. I will  send to you a proposition. What I want you to do now is to respond to the following email  addresses and send me a reply. The first thing I want you to do is to provide me with your full names and  address so that I can sending you to a foriegn account where I would deposit this  money for you. Then I will send to you a proposition. What I want you to do is to provide me with your full names and  address so that I can sending you to a foriegn account where I would deposit this  money for you. When I receive your reply I will send to you an attachment of the receipt for you to keep  and to provide me with more details and information about you so  that I can explain to you more about how we can turn this money over to you. I am waiting to hear from you. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free. You should have received your reply  from the sender. Thanks for your understanding and be blessed.  Regards Mr. Anastasios Koudas. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around  http://mail.yahoo.com

ANALYSIS/OPINION: By now you may have read the articles and news items about my working with the CIA and the various reports online about me. It seemed that I had gotten away with a lot of money, but what I really have is a lot less. I have been secretly coaching my son on investment opportunities in Africa, Indonesia and Canada and I need a reliable person who will work with him to invest the money with you, because I cannot do it on my own. I need an honest person who will work with me so that I can transfer this money into a safe account in your part of the world for investment purposes. For your assistance, I am offering you 25% of the total amount for your assistance. Both parties will agree on a percentage for your time and effort, while I concentrate on you and my investment plans. I will need a secure place where this money will be invested. The trust I have in you is unwarranted. If you do not wish to assist me, do not embarrass me by not responding to my phone calls or sending me mail. I wait for your prompt response and I will make necessary arrangements for a quick and easy transfer of this fund to your account with the help of a reputable agency in your part of the world. Awaiting your immediate response to my confidential email address: abdulcarlaabu00@yahoo.com Thank you and God bless.

But you don't have to worry about me. I'm not going to lie to you. I do know that this proposal will make you feel   better. Now, please don't be surprised about this proposal. It's because   this country has been ruled by   tyrants for so long that it has become tough for good people to stay out   of power. It takes guts and guts always. But   with the right people in power, good fortune will bless them. Please   let's make this proposal now. I'm Mr. Thomas Guei. The President of Liberia. I have two consngencies that I would like   you to help me in. One is to assist in repatriating the money and   property left behind by my late client, the late Pierre Guei. The other is to help me to establish a new business for me to   establish in spring of 2001. Let me explain the difference in the above. You help me to establish a new business for me to   establish in spring of 2001. It will enable me to transfer the money into a safe   account in your country. However, you are not required to reply to this email. I will simply refer you to this website if you   are interested in assisting us.  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/07/20/benin.crash/index.html  http://www.hindu.com/2001/WORLD/africa/10/20/benin.crash/index.html You can reply to this email address: tguei2@netscape.net Dear Sir, I am Mr Thomas Guei, the President of Liberia. In my opinion, this is the most urgent matter I will   introduce you to. I am the son of late President Charles Taylor, the first President of Liberia. Before his death, he deposited with a security firm   in the Netherlands that he intended to use to transport US$18 million, which he deposited in two   trunk boxes. It is only my father and two other men from my immediate family that knows about this  fund. My Father deposited this money in a Security company in the Netherlands. He said that the security company has   a policy against carrying on business with any company that supports terrorism. Because here in the Netherlands, the policy does   not allow such investment. As a civil servant, I cannot operate such a business. And if I do not   help you, I will   like you to run a transaction for me in your country using your name as the beneficiary   for the transferred money. I am not asking you to send me money to support this business. I need   your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I will   make this investment with you by paying whatever percentage is agreed upon, between   us. My family and I will also seek   your assistance in investing the money in any profitable business you will   suggest. We have agreed to offer you 15% of the total   amount of the money for your partnership. All we require is your honest   cooperation to enable us see this business through. All I want you to do is to send to me your telephone number and your   contact addresses to enable me initiate this transaction with you. I   will make you my personal account officer for this and all my next of   kin, in your country. This transaction is 100% risk free. All I need is YOUR ASSISTANCE TO   move the money to you, and I will do everything in   our power to make sure that this money is safe for our family and   my family. Please treat this matter with utmost urgency. As my   lawyer has advised me that you should not touch this fund unless you want   to, because you will be parting with money.  I recommend you reply this way as I have written you. Please reply through: tguei2@netscape.net Please add me to your mailing list. Thanks and God bless.

====================
OTTAWA—The federal government has spent big bucks on women's shelters, but none have been as successful as Minister Jean-Marc Serre. He founded Foundation Save the Children in 2002, and since then he has allocated several millions of dollars to buy goods and services for women in the same way as the medical and food agencies in Canada use his funds and some beforgiven him for the expenditure but none have been as successful as the $15M donation by the foundation at the end of last year. According to him, the money will be used for planting, lighting and other useful programs in the various housing projects for widows, orphans, destitute and the physically challenged. The funds are earmarked for planned housing projects for widows, orphans, and the physically challenged in Canada. The total amount earmarked for these purposes is $15M. Mr.Marc Serre has made $15M from the funds, but he wants us to claim the remaining $8M. instead of and his $5M will be used for re-imbursement to us for the inconvenience in Europe. If I do not get your acceptance to claim my $8M, I will send to you the letter of application to you. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this is a legitimate transaction and the final agreement will be done by you and I.

Orientation of the Reviewer: The reviewer was a foreigner. The reviewers are selected from a pool of eminent scholars who have published articles or books on whom to base his or her conclusions. The reviewers are paid according to the percentage indicated and the market value of the articles or books in question is not intended to be the main factor influencing the final decision in relation to the author(s) of the articles or books. It is merely my sense of the need to involve a foreigner with an impeccable reputation in this transaction. I am aware of the fact that conflicts of interest may arise during the process of selection and the final selection of the reviewers. This is merely required in my view as a matter of policy on my part to ensure that the article or books are read by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and not by individuals with political agendas and ulterior motives. The nature of your business does not matter and I will not engage in any form of unethical or illegal activity. I seek your approval as a matter of trust, as I am still in search of a trustworthy business man who can assist me in this regard. I await to hear from you immediately.

BENIN, TRACEY 0092 0092 8449 61933706892 BANQUE NOVEMBER 1999/PRESIDENT/CEO, BANQUE OF FEDERAL PRISONS /ELEVEN SUSPENCE DE COTE D'IVOIRE/ CHAMBERS.I have a very  very confidential contact of a very  very important and confidential nature in your favour, which I would like you to consider very  important.     My name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE, the wife of the former PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA MR. ALI NUHAN VAYE.I also happen to be a prior  of LATE ALI NUHAN VAYE, who was Vice President of Liberia before the current outbreak of  civil war in my country. In line with the present Government's policy and guideline, I was  not allowed to leave my country for a period of months months. The present President José K.K. Kewli declared my late husband, Mr. VICTOR CHAMBERS, to be a war  hero and executed him after he had served as Vice President of Liberia. In line with the present Government directive, I was ordered to  immediately move out of the country immediately I was ordered to leave by my  country's President. From the moment I crossed the Liberian border, I was  ordered by the Liberian Government to render my husband to the nearest peace   establishment in the world for questioning and interrogation, the  evidence in my favour was gathered and examined by one of the friendly  Government official who is now in Government post. The present Government is  filled with war criminals and war veterans who have no remorse for their  crime and every single action taken or written about me was a war crime.    This war has been going on for ten years now and I have been a dead    horse since then, because the present Government did not allow me to leave the  country. I have been living in a hotel here in the country for over a year now. This war has  cost me a lot, and my health is no exception. The evidence against me is overwhelming, and I am no   paragon of virtue. The present Liberian Government is filled with war criminal  and war veterans, they do not believe me, I am merely their     servant. They do not care about the peace in the world, they only   care that I am here, they want to know where I am at all times    so that they can come over and kill me. They are doing everything in   order to kill me, they want to have me dead so that they can have all    my money and properties. My husband was a good Christian and never committed a single   act of war. He was a farmer and he never supported the   rebel group that fight the present Government in Liberia. He was   killed by one of the rebel group(Liberians) which fights the present Government   in Liberia.          The present Government cannot fight them, they cannot even hurt them, they are just   occupying high ground. The present Government has declared war against me and   all those that oppose them.           I wish to arrange for a meeting with you and have you as a   partner in this deal, but I have decided to give you 30%   of the total sum for your co-operation and 10% for expenses   (Internal and external) in your country during the period of the   meeting, I am against any interference from any government in my country   Liberia. Please reply immediately via my private email:(tonynah_2254@yahoo.co.uk)   Thanks and God bless.

Cum Huff, 24, of Bree, NC was recently arrested by the FEDERAL Police Department for shoplifting in a dollar amount of $8,000.00 (Eight million, eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars) in a hotel/motel in Dubai, UAE. I will give you more details on what happened later. Before he was arrested, he deposited the money in a security company where the owner of the deposit has been killed in his own plane crash, along with his entire family. Many of his business associates and family members perished in the accident. Now that my late  Partner has been dead, and since I have been unable to get to him, it is very hard for me to make this money.  I have been trying to get in contact with you and tell you where the money is, but all my contact went down the River, through security company in Dubai.  Now it is my personal endeavor to contact you, and I hope you will understand and help me and my family. Please, as I am at the cross-roads of life and death, I humbly ask, do you have any interest in assisting me and my family by providing me with this money? Or would you prefer I contact you as a foreign company that is not bound by the laws of your country? If you do, you will be rewarded with 20% of the total amount of the money. Interest will be charged at 22% for you and I on your side. Kindly expedite action for now, I want us to establish a business relationship, that will enable us transfer this money to any foreign location of your choice where this money will be safe? I await your response. Regards, Mr. Tuur Demeester

I have been to the hospital with my 78-year-old mother and my 11-year-old sister.  My Father was diagnosed with Esophageal cancer  in 1990. Since then he has not  given birth and my Mother died of a heart attack while I was  on the 8th day of January, 2000 at 4:40 PM (EST) in Dubai, United Arab  Emirates.  There is  no way to cure this disease because without a new generation  born the old one will  die. My life became impossible because without a  healthy heart the cancer will  take over my body and take over my mind.  My life is  no more. I have lost all hope of ever living.  I want a God fearing God that will take me  away from this hospital and there for medical treatment  as  I am sick and cannot do anything as my health  allows me. I want you to help me to receive medical treatment  in your country or anywhere else the health of my  body will permit. Please this is not a debt I have incurred by   having a family. This is an ordinary amount but I  need a medical professional that will assist me and also have  a nice car. My health will not permit me to do this  and God is the true God. I await your response.

Now it is my belief that with your cooperation and understanding we will be able to  execute this transaction with you as the beneficiary.    On receiving your assurance that you can trust me and will be satisfied with the transaction, I shall then provide  you with more details and information which will enable you understand and agree to the transaction  proceed.

1. Introduction

This Thread will serve as our network's "Private Area" where we will post and receive non-government funding from foreign countries as donations. Due to the fact that we are not allowed to operate a Bank Account in that part of the world, we are relying mainly on donations and that comes in the form of food, clothing and shelter. We received our first funds as a result of a so called Army Base business agreement between myself and another of my partners in a neighboring country. The original sum was followed by two payments of $37.5 :one for me and my partners and the other for you. The reason why we are relying on you is because we cannot employ any of our partners without violating the code of ethics and morals. We have decided to solicit your assistance in this regard,as your company or individual to help us collect the donated funds and deliver it to you. The business agreement that we have entered into with you specifies that you will receive 25% of the funds for your effort and 5% will go for rent and other miscellaneous expenses. It is upon this that I and my partners are now seeking your cooperation in the way of receiving the funds. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the Probate in your favor to your account the sum of US$39.5million, which we intend to use for investing in your country. Are you ready to work with us? Please reply with the below information and information that will enable us better understand the transaction and then I shall give you more details in how the funds will be divided. Please keep this confidential. You can only contact me with this information, your name and address, if you wish to speak with me. The Transaction cannot be concluded if I do not tell you about it. You can only contact me with this information, your name and address, if you wish to speak with me. The Transaction cannot be concluded if I do not tell you about it. Best Regards.

====================
Two days after the US Presidential elections, I visited with my family and a few close aides in Madrid to hear the new President Forum Téléphonei enviado. This was one of the events that made me to understand the depth of the political crisis that we are going through. As I walked into the Forum, I could clearly make out the huge crowds of people around me cheering and clashing with each other. I had planned to end our trip by going to bed but because of the situation in Spain, I couldn't. This was because President Franco, who is the former leader of the Union of Right Forces and a former head of state, was elected President, and former Prime Ministers (Rápido Korda and Jose Luis Zapatero) were forced out of office. It is obvious that things haven't been going well for Spain in terms of the economy, with the inflation rate clocking in at over double the level of the national average. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I can not do anything as I have very little energy. So, I am asking you to stand as my successor as I have decided to give up all hope of survival. In return, I will like you to send me a clear and direct email, which I will send to you when the new President takes office, so that I can forward a request for your assistance in helping me to move our money and property out of Spain for investment in your country. I will want you to do for me as my representative, so that I can forward you as a transfer agent of the funds to your account. This is simple, I will like you to forward to me your contact address, phone and fax numbers for the coming telephone call. I will based on this to initiate the process of the transfer. If interested send me only the following information as above to enable me include to you as the beneficiary of the funds and the transfer to your account. The money will be paid into your account for you when you receive the funds in your account. As soon as I get an acknowledgement of your interest I will make you the beneficiary with the rest of the money in your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the Transfer. I will use my position in this bank to effect the necessary approvals and transfer of the funds to your account. Upon receipt of the funds, I will offer you 30% of the total amount for any expenses incurred in the course of the Transfer, while 10% will be set aside for any expences that may occur during the course of the Transfer. Please keep this confidential as I cannot guarantee the success of this business venture on your part. With my influence and the position of a Transfer Agent in my bank, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for investment and 10% will be invested for further investment of the funds in your country. I need you to be honest to me as my bank will be manipulating this money for profit. Upon your reply, I will furnish you with the necessary information as to how the money would be transferred into your account. I have already secured from the court documents that will authenticate the ownership of the bank as the beneficiary of the funds. All you need to do is to send to me immediately your bank details to enable me initiate the transfer immediately I receive your response and agreement to handle this transaction. I will make you my attorney and explain to you all the legal necessary arrangements that will be followed by you when the money is in your account. I will co-operate with you on a trial basis, on the understanding that we will remain neutral in this business venture. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and legal and will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Indicate your readiness to assist me to move out the money and property as I am fully ready to accept any positive decision you might have for my family. On the receipt of your willingness to assist me, I will put together all the legal documents that will laying the legal foundations for the transfer. Finally, I will instruct my Bank to transfer the total sum to your account with your name as the beneficiary. I will instruct my Bank to give you 30% of the total fund as interest, while 5% will be set aside for any expenses incured in the course of this transfer and 60% will be for the family investments. I will also instruct my Bank to transfer you the required documents that will place you in the best position to receive the money. I want to assure you that the transaction will be completed within 14 bank working day. Please get in touch with me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

eBay will not be holding any bank account with my name before the bank will release the funds to the bank as unclaimed Bill Bonds and the Board of Directors of the Bank will send a notice to me and confiscate my motor car. I will have to turn over my assets to the bank as if nothing has happened and leave the country immediately. The transaction has to be profitable for me as soon as possible because I want a very quick return on my investment. The money will be paid into your account for you as soon as I am convinced of your readiness to assist me and my family. I will have my lawyer prepare the necessary document which will put you in place as the next of kin to my late husband with all necessary rights to the funds.

Upon maturity, the money was sent to me by my bank without my signature as the beneficiary.I have made all efforts to locate any of my patients, family or relatives, but all efforts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. The money now sitting in my bank is valued at US$12,000,000.00, (Twelve Million, Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars).The management will approve this money to any foreigner because it is a family fund, but my patient is a foreigner and he made a numbered time deposit for twelve calendar months worth of US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million, Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars).

My name is Mr. Francis Domingo Smith from Republic of Congo in Africa,I work for a private security company in Europe as a firearms examiner and buyer. We have a very sick and very elderly couple that died along with their only child in a plane crash in the year 2000. I am not allowed to work with the name of their only child because I have a brother working for the same company that died in the same crash. My work is very dangerous because I must keep very close attention on their vital signs. My job is very safe because they are only in their 60's and 70's, I am working on their 70's and 80's. And they have a very good and simple life. Now, the day their health failed them, they decided to give both of them a present of $10,000,000 (TEN million dollars) to be used for funeral expenses and eventually their final disposition in heaven. I was 1st on the total bill but due to my late role I cannot collect the money. I have agreed to give you 20% if you will be able to assist me in this my work. Please note that this business is risky, as I make very good money from commissions, fees and other types of remuneration for my products and services. I am very careful on what materials to use in my work because I want to ensure that all the legal documents covering the transaction will be clear before I can work on it. Please do send me any information you will be willing to have me use. Also, note that I do not want you to send me mail that you intend to use in your business. I will simply delete all the relevant information from your mail. Finally, you should send me your telephone and fax number to enable me send you a E-mails. Hope to hear from you soon. Please, do send me any information you will be willing to have me use. And do send me your name and your business address so that I can forward you on my petition to the company to claim the funds. Thank you and God bless you. Regards.

AGAIN, WE HAVE DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF FUND VALUED AT US $6.5M (Six Million Five Hundred Thoudsand US Dollars) TO A FINANCIAL INSTITUTE IN AFRICA. THIS MONEY WAS DISGUISED AND SOLD BY THE HEROES OF OTHERS TO MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOMA REGIME. THE PROPOSITION? The funds are coming from the sale of Diamonds and Gold by Gulf States Importation of Petroleum (GSP) which is one of the major suppliers of crude oil to the Nigerian Army. The origin of the funds is still a mystery to the Government. And the source of the funds is still a mystery to the Government. The reason why the funds are not known to the Government is because the Government has been instructed to look for any and all person that can claim the funds, if any, and transfer those funds to any account of his/her choice. Thereby leaving no traces to any place. My Government would have you believe that the sale of Diamonds and Gold is innocent; that it is simply part of the daily lives of ordinary citizens. And that buying and selling of Diamonds and Gold is not that big of a deal. But as with most things in life, it's only an insider that counts. And with that in mind, I am giving you 30% of the total sum; you do the rest. I will make an arrangement for the payment to be made to you from your account in 2 weeks; you should send me an email immediately so that I can give you details on how we can make the payment. I will make you the beneficiary of the whole funds in your account; I will then come down to your country to settle down with you and your family, and send all documents to enable the transfer to take place. I want to assure you that this is ok by me as I have decided to make this whole transaction about giving to you 40% of the total funds, while you work on  my behalf as an adviser. I will also give you 30% of the total sum for your time and effort. For more information about me, you can google me, or you can visit my profile; I am very honest and trustworthy person; please do not expose or betray my trust. If you are interested, please send me an email; your phone and fax number; your contact details for easy communication as we cannot be near each other at all times. Thanks and God bless. Would you like me as your next of kin? Then send me an email; your phone and fax number; your contact name; your occupation and occupation of course; your preferred style of writing your response. I look forward to your quick reply.

====================
It is not in the least bit surprising that the dollar continues to have the most influence on the world economy. With the dollar as the world's largest currency, foreign direct investment (FDI) has soared. According to a recent study carried out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the dollar had the 12th largest economy 2014-2015, with an annualised gross domestic product (GDP) of $49.5B. The U.S.A alone accounted for $13B. the study also showed that the top ten firms in the IMF/WB have annual revenues of $40B. The top ten firms in the World Bank have annual revenues of $16B. As the world's largest economy, the United States contributes more to the problem of poverty in the world than any other nation. In 2012, the United States Government itself admitted that it is "the world's largest importer/ exporter of subsidized commodities" (UNCLAM). The World Bank reported in 2011 that the United States imported $71B. in goods and spent $24B. on foreign aid in 2010. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported in 2007 that the United States and its allies spent $575B. on foreign aid in 2010. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) reported in 2007 that the United States spent $3.3B. on foreign aid in 2010. In spite of these facts, the American people generally give to the United States Government much higher foreign aid rates than other donor nations. In response to this huge surplus, the American people have voted with their feet. The Federal Government has responded by imposing an absolute ban on all donations to the United States Government from any donor nation. Even if you are not a donor, you cannot donate to the United States Government as your money will be confiscated. The American people also enjoy a much lower effective tax rate than most donor nations. The  World Bank reported in 2006 that the United States had the 11th lowest tax rate among G20 nations. The tax burden on the average American is only 14.96%, compared to the 28.94% conducted on top donors. Therefore, donations to the United States Government in the form of dollars or eurosare among the few things that are more popular in the world of business. In addition, donations in this form are more convenient and less expensive than by cash because they are transported in cash and method of payment is by cheque, while payments in this form are made to the bank account of the donor nation which in turn are deposited in the bank vault. The World Bank also reported that in 2005, the average dollar deposited with the bank was $271M, and the average euro deposited with the bank was $310M. In view of these facts, it is not surprising that donations to the United States Government in the form of dollars or eurosare among the few things that are more popular in the world of business. As a matter of fact, donations to any of the above-mentioned donor nations have been growing at an annual rate of 1-2% annual rate for the past three years, while donations in this form have climbed to 3% annual rate for the past three years. The reason for the increase in donations to the United States Government in the form of dollars or euros is simple. The dollar is still the world currency and the donor nations do not know about this increase in donations because it does not affect their official language. Also the donor nations do not know that as their bank depositors they are giving away huge sums of money to American companies and individuals. The increase in donations to the United States Government as a result of the above-mentioned increase in donations is tremendous. As the head of our foreign operations department, I have the power to influence who will receive the money, but I choose to give it to reputable charities and groups that can best benefit the society. In the past, I have accepted donations from some well-known persons who have no doubt that they will be pleased with the money they receive. I have tried to involve the community in the donation process but it has proven unsuccessful. As it turns out, many of these donations are made by individuals who do not even know who the donors are. It is because of the anonymity that the donors want that they make these donations in person, to themselves or to send their relatives as gifts. In the present political environment in my country, donations to any member of parliament are routinely monitored by my boss. I have recently discovered that there are donations being sent to our bank account from persons who are not even aware that they are donating money. This is an alarming development. Based on this, I secretly made an arrangement with my aide that if he detects any donation coming from a non-existent account, he will send a notice to the owner of that account demanding an explanation. The money will be kept under my supervision until the funds are finally traced and confiscated. My goal here is to draw your attention to the fact that you can give money to charity

A report has emerged in the media that an American soldier who died in an ambush by rebels in Ivory Coast, was secretly married to an Ivorian woman. The husband was killed in the battle. The couple have two daughters, one of them is a schoolteacher and the other a civil servant. The journalist who broke the story obtained official documents which was supposed to back up his claim that he was the real  husband of the lady the reporter had been trying to track down. Unfortunately, this was all a ruse and the documents were fake. It is only a fool that would be so foolish as to believe the official story. Visit any news website and you will see what I mean. http://www.cnn.com/1990/US/02/01/alive.from.drink/index.html http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/michael_k.dom/ http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/michael_k.dom/ref/david_sweet.html Before his death, he had some sum of money in a dollar, I have been able to persuade my client to have the document with his name as the beneficiary registered in my bank as he will be coming over to collect his money from my bank soon. He was a very honest man and I know that he will be very grateful if you can help him. I hope that you can understand and reply me immediately.

Area 1 - The building 2 - The parking area 3 - The garage 4 - The road adjacent to the garage 5 - The area used for shooting This is the general area occupied by the foreign customers and his family  It is completely dark and pitch black outside. There is no electricity.   The power is on because the circuit breakers have been turned off. The reason for the blackout is that there was an earthquake and powerful aftershocks which caused the ground to shake. It is impossible to see from the street because of the thick black clouds. The buildings are made of low-ELEVATED STONE which makes them unreachable by human power. The owners of the buildings have long since moved out. The area is totally devoid of life. There is no trace of the buildings. The area is littered with empty cans and bottles. According to the Government, the area is deemed too dangerous for human habitation. The Government has proposed to build a mega dam in the area and raise the water level in the Cauvery about 14 feet. The Government has decided to take over the entire area and turn it into a vast dry Lake just like the one in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This lake will have a surface area of 228,000 square feet and a depth of 9.5 feet. It is expected that the lake will remain dry for at least 200 years.  SOURCE OF FUNDS (I.D) I.D. Bank does not have any documentary record of the funds in this account. The account has no other beneficiary. The manager of the FCU banking Services Department,who is also a foreigner, has stated that the funds are coming from a dead person. If I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing.  WHO IS THE BENEFICARY The beneficiary of this account is Mr. Samuel Morris. A foreigner. He died in March 2002 in a plane crash and is survived by a Wife and a Daughter.  We did not know he was going to make it  but I succeeded in getting a letter from his insurance company stating that he has no family member that is aware of the funds in the account.  IT IS THE SITUATION OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN)  to try and locate any member of his family. The problem I am having is where the money will be transferr. I have agreed that 35% of the money will be for you and your company. I will provide necessary information needed for the smooth transfer of the funds to you. I will write to you when I hear from you. If you are willing to assist me,  reply me with the information I need from you. I will provide you with more details and information that will enable you start the transfer immediately. Please note that this transaction is confidential and risk free. Kindly send me your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please do not be surprised if I do not reply you as I am busy preparing for the event.   This transaction is not risky at all. Actually, I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through.  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thank you.  Mr. Michael Khodorkovsky (for the Turkish government)

SLOAN KORUMU (REMAINING MEMBERS). I am Reverend Father Sosy, a Catholic Priest, Kama Sutra abbot,  a teacher of the Bible, and  a  Rishikeshi,  a  Buddhist and  a  Holyoke College  The former had a total sum of $23.3 Million at  end of fiscal year 2005 which has not been  claimed since then. The present value of the funds is  $16.3 million which is for us does not matter because we are still in the  process of collecting our  pension fund. The reason why the funds are still out there is because the government  has been able to get around by passing an  Act to freeze all the assets of all the  former clients of the Chanro  Vihar. The funds are therefore left there to be  revert to the government treasury as unclaimed after  seven years. There is no way around it now. The funds  are simply sitting there in the bank  as unclaimed after seven years. The situation is not going to change any time soon and hence the  funds are there for us to be able to do this. Now we need your cooperation in order to make  claims for the funds. There are a number of ways in which you can make  claims for the funds including by sending an email  to myofreksutra_enc71@yahoo.com you can also make a fax  number +46-3-33680-8485 than you can send your private  phone number for the funds to be claimed. You can also send a letter for us to sign  to the at the bank,

We have a very sensitive and proprietary information that is of utmost importance to my firm. We have a very long standing business relationship with our client, and with Good Governance, we may be allowed to keep our duty with him. Unfortunately, my client was killed in the recent conflict in Namibia and with him, the peace in our country was uncertain. Now my firm will be in much need of a foreign partner, as my client was a top official in our government. We have decided to make this purchase to enable us save on living expenses in the event of his death. In return, we will hopefully have a much better life than we had before. I would like to ask for your assistance in the following ways. To allow my firm to transfer this money into your account in your country. To assure our speedy and easy processing of this transaction. To have us prepare a document that will authenticate that the money is legitimate and that it can be claimed by us. To have us send you a short letter of how the money will be divided in 50% to you and 50% to me And 5% for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction. So if you are willing, I shall give you 25% of this money for your time and 5% for any expenses that may incur the business. Please get in touch with me through this email account: exchangers-international@netscape.net so that I shall also inform you of our interest in your country.

From:Chung Yee Lee

Subject: BUSINESS ASSISTANCE NEEDED Dear Sir/Madam, Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Unfortunately, I have not lived my life as I should have. Now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe once you find your purpose in life, you will follow your heart, and follow what is best in life(like yours truly). So I am asking you to help me, as my doctor has advised me that I may last for only two or three months before my last breath. So please reply me so that I can inform you on how I will receive this money. I want you to be my patient and to receive most of the money from this account immediately in your name. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace. As soon as you receive this mail, get in touch with me and kindly give me your phone and Fax numbers for easy and effective communication. Send also your personal details, your age and what percentage of your total compensation will be for your assistance. I will make you my very best man in every way possible, as I believe you are capable of handling such amount in a short while. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Please I do not forget your efforts and your contribution to this success. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely Jung Yee Lee.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A U.S. air crash probe into the cause of the Malaysia Airlines flight that crashed on July 21 has officially begun, with preliminary findings expected to be made public within a few days, the Department of Transportation (DOT) said on Friday.
 
====================
JMPC Agro-ecological farming, which is otherwise known as cropping, is concerned with the cultivation of food crops on degraded natural habitats. It is important to mention here that I have been a journalist in Nigeria for 20 years and have covered various agro-ecological, food and industry events in that time. I have witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of Monsanto and other biotech companies' genetically modified (GM) crops on the environment and people. Crops that have suffered from this onslaught include maize, cotton and soy. Crops that have thrived under these conditions include millet, wheat and rice. GM crops have been planted in vast areas, especially in the north of the country. According to the Ugandan Law, any person who intentionally disrupts the functioning of the natural environment, endangered species or any part of the food chain that is not suited for human life is guilty of a crime against nature and will be punished by death. The law against destruction of natural resources was strengthened after the war against the rebels. The law stipulates that any person who deliberately destroys or is likely to destroy natural resources may be punished with five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. In my report for your information, I have made a detailed investigation on all farms in my area that have been sprayed with these chemicals, and found out that the farmers have no idea what they are doing or what will happen next. Some farmers have already started to receive benefits from the government. The government has granted me various amounts of money in the exchange for my efforts and effort from my reporting and investigation. The government has also given me important documents that can be used to prove that I worked on behalf of the government. This sums to over US$15 Million. I have decided to give you 15% of the total sum for your effort. In return I have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, and 5% for any expenses that might occur during the course of this operation. I hope to hear from you soon. Please don't forget that this is a legitimate transaction, and I want to be very clear that the best interest of my child will be the most important consideration in this transaction. Please get in touch with me by my email and I will explain more in detail. Thanks in anticipation of your response. Best regards.

Greetings, This mail will be of great surprise to you because we have no previous knowledge of each other. I am contacting you to make a  reasonable proposal for me to receive your friendship and  business relationship. I am Mrs. Caroline  Davies, a middle aged widow to the former Liberian Vice President and an  Internationale.  My husband was recently elected President of an ex-political  exile grouping in Unity. He became President after the defeat  of the rebels by the forces of General Sani Abacha  the Vice President. Before his death, he had a huge sum of money totalling about $4.5 Million US Dollars  that he deposited in a safe  account in one of the top banks in Europe. At this moment, this money is still sitting in this  bank and no body has the knowledge of its existence because he has no  family. My husband already died from a blood transfusion related disease about 4 months already. Before his  untimely death, he deposited the money with one of the top bank of Europe. He will  like you to look for a reliable and reputable company that will assist us to transfer this  fund to any location of your choice where the money will be safe. And he  has already decided where the funds will be used for the benefit of the  family of my late husband. My late husband has a certificate of deposit for the money that the  bank will release to you. If you are interested, send me a brief description of the goods &amp; services  that you will be required for the transfer, I will then  likely forward it to you by fax or email. As I am very busy and indisposed at the moment from  my ill health, and also because of my community in  Liberia due to my  impotence and the ongoing political crisis that is  gripping the country, I will expect you to observe utmost confidentiality on  this transaction unless I tell you to do otherwise, Feel free &amp; keep  this business to yourself. If you are interested, please reply immediately so that I can give you more  details and more information about you and your company so as to enable us make  successful the transfer.

My name is a person from the Democratic Republic of Congo. My late father was a key figure in the plan of getting the peace in the region between the rebel forces of the former rebel forces and the government of Demo- cratic President Laurent Desire Kabila. My Father deposited the sum of US$15.5 million dollars (fifteen million five hundred thousand us dollars) with a security and finance corporation in Europe. This money was supposed to be paid into the peace fund of the West African United Nations (OWU) in the summer of 2001 but because of the war in the country and the warring factions in the government. This money was deposited in a forwarding account in Europe and was meant to be paid into the peace fund of the O.W.U.D. but because of the warring factions in the government, the money is not in our custody. It is only my husband and my children that is in touch with the outside world. My husband died along with me when I was pregnant with the child. I am really sorry if my actions have affected your confidence in me. I want you to make use of this opportunity to give me your assistance in investment of this fund.

You can find the new email address at:                                         EMAIL: matu@mail.hr.pl Dear Friend, Let me start by introducing myself to you. I am Mr.Matu Olula. I work for the International Operation Department with a bank here in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I am currently in Amsterdam, Netherlands as a Visitor and a Resident. I got your contact through a personal search from the web and so I decided to ask you for your assistance in a matter of mutual benefit. In May 2000, my boss and I, along with other managers and board members of the bank were involved in a car accident along cycle lane in the Dutch capital, Amsterdam. The driver of the car, a Bulgarian national and my boss, was killed along with other passengers inside the car. Since then I have been expecting you to come over and visit me in my hospital because I have been unable to get my health to what it used to be. This deposit that I have with you, is worth $10.3 million dollars,and has been there for a while now. Because of my position as a Banker and a Contractor, I cannot own this deposit. It belongs to my late boss, who died in the car accident. I will like to claim this money with you as soon as possible. This will enable me to send my entire family over to London, United Kingdom to live the life of a free and independent being. I want you to stand as my next of kin and help me to transfer this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin to the deceased. I will be very happy if you will reply me through my new email contact address and of course, treat as very important. I will also provide you with instructions on how to do this transfer in a just and peaceful transaction. Please I want you to treat this transaction with utmost urgency, as we cannot afford any delay. And I will be very glad if you can read this mail, as I will be very impressed if you can handle such amount in such short space of time. I await your response to this mail.

D&amp;lt;br&gt;What's the difference between a P&amp;lt;br&gt;Sales Representative and a Direct Selling Representative? A Sales Representative is a person who sells, arranges, or buys goods and/or services in confidence, knowing that his job is at risk should the government of India investigate his transaction. A Direct Selling Representative is a person who arranges or buys goods and/or services in a uniform fashion, knowing that he will be of no use to any of his customers. Both these types of reps have their own set of rights and responsibilities that will be fulfilled when the goods and/or services are delivered to them. The difference between the two jobs is that a Sales Representative sells his or her goods or services to Others, while a Direct Selling Representative arranges or buys in bulk with his or her employees other people's goods, knowing that he or she will not be of any use to his or her customers. Both types of reps have their own set of rights and responsibilities that will be fulfilled when the goods and/or services are delivered to them. What we need to do now is to find a reliable and trustworthy person who can assist us to transfer this sum, and all the associated documents and proof of the goods/services being delivered to you, so that the funds will be claimed and paid into your account. We will arrange for the transfer of the funds in your favour, so that you will be given the opportunity to use your own share of the funds you receive. The reason we need you to stand as the beneficiary of this fund is because it is from the sales of which the government will be reimbursing you with the money. This is the reason why it is important for us to have you as a potential beneficiary. When the funds is transferred into your account, you will be given 40% of the money, while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that might occur during the time of transfer and also phone bills. We will also make arrangement for you to receive your share in cash, so that all will be settled. It is very important that you send to me immediately your personal telephone and fax numbers for easy communication between us. Finally, it is necessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via official channels, as I am still under the influence of narcotics. I sincerely await to hear from you. please send immediately your direct telephone and fax number for easy communication.

For the record, I am a Christian, and I want you to believe me, and give me your attention. I am not asking you to believe me, I am asking you to look for a reliable and trustworthy person, who can assist me in getting an investment of my choosing in your country which I can use for investment purposes, which will be your profit and communal site. I will explain to you more about what to do immediately I hear from you. As soon as I hear from you, I will definitely introduce you to the venture capital firm of Mr. James (Jim) Morris of Dubai, who is a trusted adviser to me, and the former Chairman/CEO of Pebble Oil Corporation in West Africa. And he will give you 15% of the total investment. I am very serious, because the situation in my country now is very critical, as my late father is the Chairman of the National People's Congress, and my late father was arrested several times for attempting to influence the policies of my late father. Unfortunately, my father was poisoned by his business partners, after he died, and he was poisoned to death in prison. According to Angola law, at the end of your life, you'll be registered as "dead" and no one will ever come forward to claim that you were the owner of any of his properties. This is a very sad situation for me, because I have been very positive in my future as a Christian, now that my father has passed. But now; God has spoken, and revealed to me, that you are scum and nothing more; that you are a disgrace to God, and to man. Therefore, I will like you to reply immediately. I will make you one of my "investment advisers", to which I will give you 15% of the total investment, which will be your profit and communal site. I will tell you about the investment decisions I will make immediately I hear from you, because it is only I who can advise on investment. We will see what happens, if you respond to my email. God be with you and God bless. Mr. Micheal Ado?s Regards.Mr. Micheal Ado?s Email is: michealadoc93@rediffmail.com

  The funds are deposited in a Security Company in South Africa  due to their  liberal attitude towards the country as an  independent country.  This Company is owned by Mr K.T. Reid who was  the former Prime Minister of Liberia before his  removal from office due to a civil war there in  2001. He died from an Ebola virus  disease which infected over 190 people and caused  death of over 600 people in the world wide  war as per the World Health Organization  guidelines.  The funds are deposited in a box with my name as the  beneficiary. As per the South African Law, at the expiration  of 4 years the money will revert to the ownership of the  Government if nobody applies to claim the fund  or if the money remains unclaimed after that period.  Thus, my intention is to extend  the invitation of you to apply to the Government of South Africa to  receive the funds deposited in your account  for possible release to you as the beneficiary or  next of kin to the deceased.  The Government will make the release to you as  the beneficiaries or next of kin to the deceased, depending on  which of the two of you apply first. This  transaction is 100% risk free. The  only thing you need to do is to send the following text  to me, so that I will send you the complete application  along with all the necessary documents so that the application  will be approved and a letter of application will be  sent to you.  This will enable me to claim the funds from the Security Company  in South Africa without any problem either now or in future  because you will now have my name as the beneficiary. I  can then instruct my attorney to prepare the letter of  application to you, and send it to you when you get the money into  your account for your reception. I will destroy all my  documents immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to  any place. I am very certain that this will be your  last transaction with me, as soon as you send the money to  me, I will send my Attorney to prepare the letter  of application to you and include the document  that I will give to you as the next of kin to the  deceased. I will also give you 30% of the total  amount for any expences that might occur between now and  the time of your reply. May I assure you that this is  a very low risk transaction, as I will  have all necessary legal documents that can be  used to back up any claim we may make. I want you to  trust me and trust  me as I work out the modalities of this transaction. I  will also give you 15% of the total  amount for any mistakes or omissions in this transaction. Looking  forward to hearing from you soon as porsible Sir.

====================
Rajasthan, India - September 22, 2018. . /rrems.html#tutupart Three men and one woman died when a massive Togo Airways flight they originated from the capital of Cotonou-Senegal fell silent and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, August 31,2007. Here is a brief information about the crash. http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/07/02/togo.airlines.list/ http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/07/02/togo.airlines.list/index.html http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/people2/index.html http://www.nativefederation.org/people/people2/story/index.html 3. WHY DID YOU COME HERE IN  RUSSIA? There are certain regulations and guidelines that must be followed by all Government servants when dealing with funds that exceed the allowed amount. In the case of Kazakhstan, these were done to ensure that no one will divert the funds for any business, personal or family benefit. There was an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since 1997 nobody has operated on this account again. It is because of this that my investigation led me to  understand that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if it stays this long without any next of kin it will be confiscated and sent to [the Central Bank of Russia] as unclaimed funds. It is because of this that my interest is to claim this money and use it for my own personal benefit and if possible, to help the widows and orphans of the deceased. For your information, the owner of the account is Mr. Mark Karpov, a foreigner, and the Fund is a one-time disbursement of $10,000,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred and Fifty One Thousand Dollars). If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address (aillebama@myway.com) for the process to follow immediately. Regards.

The money will be transferred to an account in your name to the tune of One Hundred and Sixty two Million US Dollars only, which I will disclose to you after a mutual business relationship has been established. And God willing, we will get your full name and address so that the government can send a notice to your account to claim the money, which will enable you to come over and claim the money immediately it reaches you, while I wait for your urgent response so that I can then inform you as to the next step to take. Please keep this confidential as you can only reach the people you want to contact with your word.

But before you claim this money, you have to get out from under the influence of drugs and alcohol. And that is exactly what I did before I was able to clear my head and concentrate on the money which I deposited in a safe deposit of a security company here in Greece. On the 22nd of February 2004, my Secretary called me and informed me that the funds had been moved to a safe account in Hong Kong. I immediately had to go down to Hong Kong and see if I can borrow the money to invest in any business venture in your country.and after going through some job advertisement and interviews I found my way to you and convinced me that you are capable and reliable to help me deposit the money in your account, which is in my personal company's safe deposit with a security company here in Greece. I will be very grateful if you can assist me on this very important transaction that will benefit both of us, I have decided to use this opportunity to reach out to you and offer you 20% of the total amount for your assistance. You can contact me on my private email address: gstylianakis1@katamail.com as soon as you receive this message, I will put you in the picture of how we can discuss the transaction because it is very confidential. I will give you 30% of the total amount, 10% will be set aside for all expenses that might occur in the course of the transaction and 70% will be kept by my company. Trust me, this is very confidential and I would not want to enter into any deal with you at this stage. The transaction is very simple and straight forward, I will simply introduce you to my  company as the one that has the deposit and the management will approve this deposit for you as the beneficiary. I will provide all necessary information which you will need to help us clear the money from the security company and invest it in any profitable business venture. All you need to do is to email me with the following information below if you are interested in this transaction: 1. Full Name: 2. Your Telephone/Fax number: 3. Your Contact Address: Please note that this transaction is 100% risk free with no reports to be had from the security company.

A raygun can shoot a ray, but it doesn't shoot everything. Rayguns work best when aimed at highly-dense objects such as buildings, bridges, and oil refineries. But they don't always work that way. In some cases, they work against the direction of the beam they're aimed at. This happens all the time. In one famous case, a company paid by the government of a country to develop a special high-speed rail line paid a huge amount of money to construct a massive network of beams all over the world. The government of West africa spent a huge amount of money trying to put a stop to this, and they succeeded in having the money diverted into the military budget. But in spite of this, the beams keep coming. And in spite of all their efforts, the funds keep coming. The problem the government of West africa has is that they have too much money. They spend a lot of money trying to put a stop to this. They have too much money because they have too much people. But they don't have the means to stop the flow of money.

====================
The present government has failed miserably in its mission to fight against corruption and other  illegitimate practices of all kinds. It has looted the wealth of our country and really  nobody believes that we will live up to our end of the trust. The present government is more interested in enriching its own  members and officials than in fighting corruption. The present government has cracked down hard on all  forms of honest trade and business. It has frozen all assets of all  individuals and companies that are not in line with the prevailing  political agenda. We are now on the verge of reaching the end of our days. My late father was a businessman, and he died a  millionaire after he died. He had a total sum of USD$10.5million left behind him in cash  and he deposited it in a  bank where I now now have a bank account. The money was deposited in a box with a security  company and was deposited in a box in a security &amp;  shipment that my late father deposited his gold bars in. It was made from  twelve sisters, and the State has been  completely breaching the sovereignty of the mother country by  interfering in her business dealings. It is because of the  situation that my late father has decided to  moved the money  for my safe keeping in the West Africa Region. The security company that  handled the box has also been  destroyed, and as it is raining heavily,  my late father is carrying on all the boxes that the rain  soaked. It is because of this that he has decided to get a safe  shipping company in West Africa to assist my late father  in his safe keeping of the money and the box. My late father has also agreed to give me 20% out of the total  sum for all expenses that he incurs due to the money  being deposited in his behalf. My late father has agreed to give me 10% of the total  sum. I have plans to invest my share of the money that my late father  will have left over in real estate in your country if  you agree to my proposal. In return, I have agreed to offer you 20% of the total  sum if you agree to take 20% of the profits of the business  in your country. I have decided to give you 5% of the total  sum for your business expenses, while the remaining  5% shall be for all expenses that might occur  between now and when this fund  is transferred into your account. If you are willing to assist me in  this transaction, please reply immediately via the below email  addresses: mysenate@mail.indiatimes.com , myhusband@mail.indiatimes.com , or me directly. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and  arrangements that will facilitate the transfer of the money and  contents. I shall also allow you major flexibility in  the way you would like to be compensated for your efforts and  continued assistance to me in this transaction. I look forward to hearing from you soonest. Thank you and God bless. My dears sinner, I am offering you 15% of the total sum for your acceptance, hope to hear from you soonest. Regards, Tunde Adebimpe

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) here today launched the "Pakistan Peoples Front For A Free &amp; Fair Trade" campaign. The campaign was started by my party (the Pakistan Peoples Front for A Free &amp; Fair Trade) in response to the government's move to ban the Nepal and Bangladeshis in the face of overwhelming international and international media and opinion, which portrayed us as the suppliers of bombs and ammunition to the world-renowned terror group, the world-renowned terror group that attacked our embassy in Darfur, Sudan in December 2002.The campaign has been going on for over 2 years now. The campaign has received tremendous response from the public. And most importantly, we have not had a single bomb or ammunition in our possession when we launched the campaign. This was because we were very careful with our purchases and carefully monitored by our employees and consultants. We monitored our supplies closely. Now that the situation in Darfur has developed to the point that our supplies are no longer safe, we are now looking for places to store the money because we cannot possibly produce any more. I intend to use this site as a proof of concept to get your assistance to transfer the money in your account for investment in your country. The money is deposited in a financial Institution in Europe. I am very sure that you will not let down the trust I have in you. Please, reply immediately via this private email address: jimal5@yahoo.com Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I await your soonest response. Please keep this very confidential.

Greetings to you, I am Dr. Zuhair Amin Ali, the Director of Operation at the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Ever since the rise of the Muslim friend in my country, I have watched with keen interest to see the future of the world.Nowadays, I have two daughters and as they get older I find it hard for me to manage my assets and also take care of my children and grandchildren.Ever since I got married to my late husband, I have been looking for a way to have a child outside of my marriage. My husband was a successful businessman before his death, but because of his ill health, he could not make it in life at this stage. Before his death, he had some huge sums of money like $5.5million dollars in cash for me and my family to keep for my children and grandchildren. As it might interest you to know, I have not the slightest knowledge of money and I believe everyone has to be their own worst enemy.Now that my late husband is dead, and my children have grown up, I have decided to give the alms to charity organizations or better still, the one that will benefit you the most.I decided to donate this money to charity organizations or better still, the one that will benefit the most, some charity organizations in the world are known for their great work in the face of great challenge.For instance, The aid organization United Way Europe has given some great aid to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Indian Ocean tsunami, they have been evacuated to India and Pakistan but still need the donations of Pakistanis and Indians to help them. An American Red Cross has also come down to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Indian Ocean tsunami in Southeast Asia. In other news, The World Bank has been helping to fund some of the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Indian Ocean tsunami. I have decided to use this money to immediately move the funds to any new safe account in your country as they will be donated to charity organizations. I have decided to make this money available to charity organizations or better yet, the one that will benefit the most, for them to help you and give you an account to store the money for the benefit of charity organizations. I have also decided to give you 30% of the total amount for your advice which I will need in what will be my next move after you are ready to assist me. I have decided to use this money for investment, but what will be your investment? I have decided to give you 30% for your time which I will need in your time too, and I hope you will reply quickly enough to let me know you are ready to help me. Please reply immediately so I can let you know where the money is and also have a closer look at the file. I will give you more details on how the money will be spent for you in the coming days.

Thanking you for your acceptance is necessary to enable us move the funds to your account with us. This is necessary because the former owner of this account dies, and since then nobody has done anything to claim the money. The bank will not acknowledge the existence of the account unless someone applies for the claim as the next of kin or relation to the deceased with a deposit statement or other document that proves the funds exist and are being used for a legitimate business purpose. We have notified you that we will make every reasonable effort to make sure that this money will not get into the government treasury as unclaimed bill. It is our belief that you will not allow this money to stay in your account. We have agreed to offer you 15% of the total amount for your effort and 5% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses that might arise during the continuance of the transaction. Please get in touch with us by my email address if you are interested in this project. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will enable you apply to your bank to claim this fund.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting Your Immediate reply. Best Regards. STEPHEN. BIRDE, FEDERAL MINISTRY OF MINES AND POWER, EF.MINISTR. JAMES.SMITH.

Q. As an individual, how do you feel about  the fact that your name came up in the  FBI  Terrorist Watch list in 2004 ? Do you feel that giving your name as  the beneficiary of a fund in a terror attack is  a good idea ? A. I feel that it is a good idea. It is just that I  was only 21 years old and was not really familiar with the  situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are now in a better environment and things  have already been taken care of. Now, it is only a matter of time before things get  worse and more dangerous in the world we live in. The  American Government has already begun to move to place restrictions and  restrictions on my family and I. I cannot allow this. I want you to help me to clear my name and  fund from the terror fund in your country  so that I can move out immediately. United Bank   SAC is one of the largest bank in the world and  has a fixed deposit policy. To clear this fund from the  bank, I have agreed to offer you 20% of the total  sum for your assistance. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. I  consider you an honest and trustworthy person, so that is what I will want you to do. I will  give you 15% of the overall funds for your assistance (US$10,000,000) in  your country. I will also provide you with 15% of the total  sum for your personal expenses as I am sure that you will be able to handle this  business transaction on your own. I will be very glad if you can handle this project as a  family. This is a legitimate transaction, you can confirm this from the  website below: http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/iraq.war/index.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/iraq.war/index.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/21/iraq.war/index.html The transaction will take at least 2 weeks for either party to  execute. So if you are interested, please reply immediately so that we can have a closer  discussion on how we can share the profits after you receive the money.

Result

After several months of searching, I located your contact details, which was enough to get your attention. I am Mrs. Maryam. Abacha, the wife of old  Malay King, the former First Family  and the CEO of Goldcorp. Malaysia. I have just discovered a small fraction of a fraction of a percent (0.0000000000000000000000000000) of the total  amount of US$22.5 Million left in an account that belongs to one  of my foreign business partners that died among many others in the Air France concord plane crash  crash in  Paris, France on the 31st of July 2004.  http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/10/german.crash/ Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and  claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it  as next of Kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately I learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind  for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of Kin or  relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to  go into the government treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates  that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will  revert to the government treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of Kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and an  Indigene cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision  of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated. I have  all necessary instrument to back up any claims I may make. I hereby  advise that you should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Upon the receipt of your response, I will  send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application which you must  immediately send to me. Finally, I will send to you a brief explanation of the  transaction and its necessary modalities. I shall expect you to observe utmost  secrecy and confidentiality as my life is at stake. May God bless and protect your family. Yours faithfully  Mrs. Maryam. Abacha (Mrs. Abacha Abacha) ____________________________________________________ E-mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://www.pq.com

I want to introduce my family to you, but I don't know any member of my family. My only brother died since I was a little girl. And my only sister and I have been separated for the past seventeen years. Before that, there was no my mother. Before that, my father was killed during the civil war in my country. I don't know any other person in this world besides my mother.  My only Father was killed when he tried to remove a bomb that was placed in one of his many businesses for now. This war in my country broke my family apart.  My mother lost her life in the plane crash of Kenya Airways flight number 261 that took place on the 31st of November 2000.  My Father was killed when he tried to flee from the Nairobi Detention Camp to Botswana. For more information about the Kenya Airways flight number 261 click the link below and read about it. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/kenya.airlines.list/ Since then, I have been in a lot of care here in Siam. This is because my late Father took me and my only Sister to live in a care home here in Siam, before my late Father and I were supposed to be taken out by the civil war in my country. After the war in my country, I was taken to Ethiopia where I am now staying now. I want to send you a mail so that you can assist me and my family in getting out of this care home in Ethiopia.I have for you, my favor to help me and my family out of this care home. All I need from you is to furnish me with all necessary informations that can be used to back up my claim to your care home as the next of kin to my late father. I have already decided to seek your consent to present you as my next of kin to my late father so that you can help me and my family out of this care home. At the end, I want you to help me to send you a copy of the receipt provided by the civil servant so that you can forward it to the civil servant to claim this money. The transaction is 100% risk free as all I need from you is your honest co-operation to enable me to receive this fund from the civil servant to you as the next of kin to my late father. So, if you are interested, send me your telephone number and fax number for me to give you a call to discuss it. I have been given the sum of US$12.5 Million by the civil servant to send out for disbursement of the fund. I will instruct the attorney for us to get a first installment of US$4 million dollars in cash which my late father deposited in a safe box for safe keeping in a private security company for future investment. I will then instruct the attorney to arrange all legal documents that will authenticate the fact that you are the owner of the box. When I have all legal documents in place, I will send you an application for us to make you the owner of the box for the deposit. We will also share the funds on an equitable ratio which will be determined by you as part of the fund. I will give you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon. You should get back to me as soon as possible. Please treat this matter with utmost urgency. Thanks.

====================
I am a former leader of DAPL, the Government Engineer Upper House of South Africa,a mineral and gas merchant/contractor with Tiscali SA, and former member of the Public Works Commission. I resigned from the Government Commission due to my perceived interference in the affairs of other departments of the Government. According to the Laws of South Africa, at the expiration of 7(seven) (2002), the Government must re-compile all the funds overstacked on 31 July 2000, including the funds to be released in 2005 by my government. Since I have been inactive for the past several years, the Government must now seek a new candidate to claim the funds. Since I have been in the Government Commission for so long, I have no fear as all my contracted colleagues have already left the Government Commission to form their own private businesses. I therefore ask for your willingness to stand as my foreign business partner and help me to claim the funds on my behalf. I will pay 10% commission which will be for every transaction that takes place. All I will ask for is that you keep this business transaction very confidential and as a last resort. I want us to meet face to face and sign a binding agreement that will bind us together. I am counting on the grace of God that you would never let me down. So Please reply urgently so that I can furnish you with the full details and the forms for the claim. If you consider this proposal, I will be very grateful and await your immediate response. Best Regards, Mr Jo-Wiliam kabila __________________________________________________ Broadband from an unbeatable £15.99! http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=SM-NL-11AM

A psychiatrist who examined me said it was because of my relationship with my family that my recovery was not as successful as it could have been. The reason why people do not recover from alcohol addiction is that they do not know what causes it and the person may not even know they are addicted. What causes it is simple, alcohol creates a high in the brain which when mixed with other substances such as cocaine or heroin makes the person think they are getting high, when in fact they are not and the real cause of the problem is the destruction of the brain cells that support the liver. This leads to the build up of substances such as acetone, which is what caused my problems, as well as leading to my arrest. The problem I have right now is that my body is not in good health and my health is not up to speed with what I would like it to be. Consider that I have not drunk any alcoholic beverage my entire life and am not even remotely tempted. This is the main reason why I cannot think straight. What I want you to do is to simply take 30% of what I have left and invest it in any profitable business or real estate in your country which I will instruct my attorney to open an account in your country where I can transfer the money and use it to set up a new home for me so that I can have more time for my health. I have already decided on a course of action for you to take as I have decided to use this money for investment in your country. I am very sure that with God all things are possible. I have already decided to give you 30% of the total amount for your assistance as I have already decided on a course of action for you to take. I want you to immediately reply me with your full name and address so that I will inform you more on how we shall proceed. I will then introduce you to my attorney to obtain an application and line drawing for your assistance and I will let the attorney handle everything else. All I will need from you is to simply answer the simple question; "What percentage of the total amount would you like me to receive for your assistance?" Once I have your urgent response, I shall then explain to you in detail on how we shall proceed with you. This will enable me to get the funds deposited in your account processed and then we can share the profits when you receive the funds. I sincerely hope you can understand and be in agreement with my proposal. I await your response to my email address; ken-sideshow94@netscape.net Best Regards, JOSEPH TAYLOR. ___________________________________________________________________________ TOPICS:

ON THIS DAY IN SIXTY-ONE YEARS AGO, AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YENA, MY LATE COLLEAGUES AND I HAD DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A LIFE OF A HITCH-FREE AND SAFE TRANSACTION. WE CONSIDERED IT TO BE A SINCERELY HITCH-FREE TRANSACTION. BUT, DURING OUR TIME IN GOVERNMENT, OUR INTERNATION WAS DETECTED AND PASTED TO SOME EXTENT THAT IT WAS A HUGE DEPOSIT BONAFIDE US$8.5M (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) BY THE GOVERNMENT. HE HAS BEEN GRANTED POLITICAL ASSYLUM BY PRESIDENT JOE KABILA, IT IS THIS THAT GIVES ME THE SITUATION TO PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE MANUFACTURE. DURING THESE SEARCH, I HANDLED OVER MY SINCE I AM TRANSFORMING MY LIFE, YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE MY PERSONALITY. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN STRICTLY PROPER IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU, I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO KEEP "TOP SECRET". I WANT YOU TO ASSIST ME IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCKS IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. THIS MONEY WOULD BE INHERITED FROM US$8.5M (EIGHTEEN MILLION US DOLLARS) IF  THE INVESTMENT IS ROLLED OVER AT THE END OF THE MONTHS. I WILL ALSO WANT YOU TO ASSIST ME IN INVESTING THIS MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. I WILL THEN WANT YOU TO TAKE ME A SERIES OF YOUR FEDERAL PRIME MINISTRY OF PETROLUEM RESOURCES IN YOUR COUNTRY AND INVEST THIS MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WE WILL THEN MENTION YOUR NAME IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT, AND YOU WILL BE DELIVERED WITH A MONEY ACCOUNT.I WILL ALSO WANT YOU TO ASSIST ME IN INVESTING THIS MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WE WILL END THE CHANGING OF THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY, AND YOU WILL TAKE 35% OF THE TOTAL SUM. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REALITY OF THE MATTER IS THAT IT WILL BE VERY WISELY AND INAVELY TAKED OVER IN A COURT OF LAW. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS AN "IMMIGRATION". IT WILL ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED AS A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. TO AVOID THIS, I WILL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THIS DEPOSITING YOUR NAME AS THE OWNERS, AND THEN THE FUND WILL BE REMITTED OUT TO LOCAL AND FOREIGN BUYERS WITH YOUR NAME IN TENURE. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY YOU WILL NEVER, EVER LET ME KNOW THAT YOU are INVESTING THIS MONEY, I WILL BUILD A FILE OF MY OWN IN THE BANK IN YOUR COUNTRY, IN YOUR NAME AS THE FIXED PARTNER. THIS WAS AS A RESULT OF MY REQUESTING YOU TO UNDERTAKE A FIXED PARTNER, WHO WILL BE INVESTED IN YOUR COUNTRY'S RETIREMENT AS A PARTNER, AND THIS REMITING WILL TAKE US 13% MONEY: I WILL REQUIRE YOUR FULL NAME, ADDRESS, YOUR CONTACT ADDRESS AND AS  YOU ASSIST ME, I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE YOU THE FIXED PARTNER. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE TO ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT OVER TAKE THIS MONEY, AND THEN CLAIM MY  TRUST, WITH MY POSITION IN THIS BUSINESS. I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS MUTUAL, AS ALL THE COST AND RISK WILL BE OURS. I WILL ALSO INFORM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINT US, AND THAT WE WILL SHARE IT 50/50, YOUR PARTNER AND I WILL ALSO DISCUSS ON YOUR PERIOD OF INVESTMENT. I SHALL ALSO INFORM YOU WITH  MY DETOUR THAT YOU WILL TAKE, THAT OF OUR AGE IN MARINA FRANCOIS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME CAMP IF I MAY INVEST THIS MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY, IN LIKE MANNER OF YOUR COUNTRY AND I WILL SETASIDE

====================
[UPDATED BELOW] This summer, a group of about thirty academics and I made plans to celebrate 40 Years of  Independence in Johannesburg, South Africa.We  decided to hold a seminar series across the country on  how to  transfer funds without the knowledge of our Governments  foreign and local partners. This was to enable us to  invest this money in legitimate business ventures in  your country, so that the money would not go into  the Central Bank of South Africa (C.B.S)  Account. The money would be paid into your account  by the Government (government) through its foreign and local  accountants, for your investment. The seminar series was  going to be held from 17th to 22nd July, 2002 in  Johannesburg, South Africa. We arranged to meet in Johannesburg, South Africa, to  discuss on how we can transfer this money making it  for investment in your country. We agreed that 25% of the money would be for you,  for your inspiration and 5% for EXPENSES  (expensed travel expenses) would be for expenses incurred during the  seminar series.  For now, we are under a lot of stress because of the seminar series  in my bank. It is because I cannot invest this money in your country because  negotiations are going on between me and my bank  account officer, that I am contacting you requesting your assistance in this  transaction. You are to assist me to transfer the money till we  arrive at your country, and then I will simply  give you 25% of the total money, while 5% will be set aside for  expenses incurred during the seminar series.  The Bank has now changed their mind and now wants to  have the funds held in an account  over which they have no control, I cannot give  them that permission, hence the urgent  need for you to come down to South Africa and discuss with  me face to face.  For your understanding and co-operation, I have agreed to give you 20% of the total money. I  would also like you to fax or email me on the above fax number so that I would  discuss on how much you will be willing to pay for your good faith  assistance in this regards. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk free and  absolutely confidential. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this  deal through. Upon success of this transaction, I shall  require a meeting with you in your country, to explain to  you more about the transaction and how it will  be carried out. My thank you from the bottom of my heart and thank you for  your understanding. If you are interested, you can reply me with this:                                                             This is my secret code for your protection:                                                                                                                                                   When Mail1.com:                                           Get your private email address:                                                  Get your free E-mail, at Mail1.com                                      So it's that simple. I am Barrister Mike Ashley, I work for one of the top  law firms in Johannesburg, South Africa, I handle a huge amount of cases   pertaining to Bank and I have a very interesting business   partnership with a very reputable person who is a  commercial operator of a mine. This   company has a contract to transport   Diamond Products   Diamond Ingot  and Diamond Ingot Brides in a   United Kingdom and
====================
 dated 25 th April 2000, signed by the President and a few top officials of the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone. The document was sent by diplomatic courier service on business trip to the Republic of Sierra Leone where the fund was deposited.  It is signed by the President Mokashe Musa which means  "I Signed this to ensure that our financial relationship goes  smoothly  as it is still being monitored by an assistant responsible for  foreign affairs who is also involved in this project.  However, the actual contents of the document was kept for security reasons because  it was sent in cash. The Government of Sierra Leone have arrested my late husband because of this document.  I am being kept in prison camp  because my alleged accomplices are being investigated for military coup before my demise.  This is the story of my life and I don't have any way out.  I want you to help me to get out from here and that's why you are being offered to me as an assistance by you.  I have decided as what percentage of the total sum you are willing to assist me to get out from here. Offering you 20% would be fine, while 100% would be the payment from the Government for your assistance. Offering you 35% would be fine, 50% would be for me, while 10% would be for expenses incurred by both parties during the process of the transfer. The only thing you need to do is to get back to me with your only email contact address so that I can forward it to the Government of Sierra Leone for their approval in this deal.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for my helping you and 40% for me.  It will give you a total cash amount of US $11.6 Million. What you need to do is to forward to me your only email contact. I will then forward to you the copy of the deposit certificate of the consignment containing the money. I will then give you details on how the funds will be handled in the diplomatic courier service to avoid any trace of the funds.  I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail. Please keep this confidential for security reasons as I have been instructed not to discuss this matter with anyone. Please ignore my email and my private telephone messages. You should also note that this transaction is risk free as everything will be done by the diplomatic courier service due to the fact that I have a representative in the world.  Thanks and God bless.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SELF: As you may know, i have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. Although I have had my last of blood, I still have a great deal left in me. My doctor told me that I have only about a few months to live, and that I should not even consider conceiving or having child. My doctor also told me that I would not last for the next two months due to the cancer problem. Now that I have been in the hospital with the help of my only daughter and the support of a midwife, I have decided to donate this money to charity organizations, as I want this money to go into a charity organization that will benefit me and my family. My late father Mr. Louis  Tjofeja was the richest man in sierra Leone until his death. He had an estimated net worth of the money of $2.5 million dollars. Before his death, he deposited the money with a security company in Europe, which I have been able to track down and claim. I am very sure that he will never let us see each other. Since i have been in the hospital with the help of my only daughter, my daughter has been taking charge of my life, and i have decided to use this money to help charity organizations that are in need of money. I have decided to use this money to buy food, clothing and shelter for the families of the deceased. I have decided to use this money for this purpose because i want the money to be given into a charity organization. The money has been deposited in a security company in Europe and the money will be delivered to charity organizations in the EU. I have decided to use this money to send my daughter on a mission to any charity organization that will receive it for us. I want my daughter to be granted a visa to come over to the EU and claim the money on my behalf. I have decided to use this money to send my daughter to any country that will benefit her, like you, so that she will claim it on my behalf. You are to come down to London, United Kingdom to meet with me and discuss on business investments. The deal is that i will like you to provide me with 15% of the total money for you, 5% for any expenses that may occur during the course of the transaction and 60% for me. The transaction will be concluded when i reach your country. I will want you to come down to London, United Kingdom and meet with me there for the purpose of processing the deposit and delivery of the money to charity organizations. If you are interested, please reply me on my email address and send to me your telephone and fax numbers for ease of communication. I will send you more information as soon as i receive your response, in the next mail. As soon as this message get to your mailbox, i will let you know the status of the transaction. Thank you for your anticipated attention. Regards, Mr.Bevan Richard _________________________________________________________________ A free email with membership login www.smarturl.com/smarthome

Nagasaki Electric Power Company Ltd. (NEPPC) is the Member,  Managing Director and Chief Engineer of the Nuclear Safety and Safety Department of the  Government of Japan. I am writing to request for your assistance in the business  of contacting an attorney to assist you to receive 40% of the total money  (US$45.5M). The attorney is Mr. Takahiro Yamaguchi a lawyer at law.  The money is currently being held in trust for future investment by the  Government of Japan in its public utility subsidiaries.  This money was paid into  contract by the Government of Japan with a view to repaying the  contracted works in the not-too-distant future. The contract for the Tanaka-Dakar  Gas Plant was awarded to France in 2001 and was  officially inked in 2004 by the Japanese Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry  (FMTI).  There are revision slips for the various different  contracts awarded for the past ten years 2003 and the sums  are being paid into the  Government Trust Account (GTO).  Since I got the details of the money, I have been trying to locate the  owner of the consignment which totaled (US$45.5M)  and managed by a Foreigner who died in the plane crash of JapanAir  Line #221 with other passengers on board on May 20, 1997.  Because of the tight time frame of recovery by the  Government, they are only allowing the Foreign  Transferees out of the country to claim the money.  I have been looking for a reliable person to assist me in this  transaction in order to minimise the chances of his cooperation  in the causes of his death.  My proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the  next of kin to the deceased,  so that the proceeds of this account valued at  US$45.5M can be paid to you and then you  can share it with him, or anybody else as the beneficiary.  That's it, the transaction is simple and straightforward. I  alone have the power of the money, no one else knows of this  account and if I don't tell anyone, nobody will ever know.  The money will stay in this account until somebody applies  for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as  indicated in my confidential circular letter  sent to the relevant ministries.  The  money will be paid into the account under your control as  a result of the trust I have in you.  I have all the documents where you can see the  receipts for your perusal. If you are willing to assist me,  we can discuss on how to share the money in your  favor. I need you to reply urgently, as I will  give you all necessary details and necessary  information to enable me prepare and present you as the  next of kin of the deceased so that the  funds can be paid into your account.  I will then come over to meet you in your country and  present you as the beneficiary so that you can draw  the money out for me and your personal use.  I will  immediately give you instructions on how to transfer the  funds, and this will be done with the manginer and  cox. cable which is used to move the cables.  I have  already set-aside the maximum sharing ratio for your  consideration, as below:  1. 40% for you as the foreign  account holder, 2. 20% for expenses incurred during the  transaction, whilst the others shall be for me  and my family properties, investments and other expenses that  will be incurred over time in the course of the business if  necessary.  I will  keep a close monitoring of everything that is happening in this  transaction and at the end of the day I shall  give you 35% of the total fund for you, so you should  rest assured that this is a safe transaction  at the end of the day. I await your immediate reply to my letter. Please, treat with  utmost urgency. I trust your opportunity to  serve in a beneficial manner for both of us. I await your response. Best Regards.

PROPOSITION: We discovered an abandoned sum of US$22.5 Million (Twenty Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer, a Malaysian, who died along with his entire family in December 2002 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the money until somebody has been given the legal custodial orders to do so. Unfortunately, his supposed next of Kin died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of Kin or Relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking ethics here is to keep all unclaimed money for future generations as unclaimed. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. The request for you as a foreigner in this business is occasioned by the fact that you are not familiar with the banking and finance world and therefore cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased. I agree that 30% of this money will be for the expenses incurred by you during the business day as a result of the time you are expected to spend in the office, while the balance will be for my own personal use. Thereafter, I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Please be honest to me and trust is our Watchword in this transaction. Note that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail to let me know where you are and what to do regarding the agreement of the transfer to you. Please note that this transaction is risk free and that you should not entertain any fear as all necessary arrangements have been made for the transfer. Thank you in advance and God bless. Regards.Mr.Eric Ayling. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ TVA - Zawahiri e-zine - garbuma! http://www.metopriem.net/tva-zine/

SOME BACKGROUND DETAILS. I. Background. The present problem I am having with regard to you and your company is that both you and your company have the same information. Which of you have you and your company's assets? For example, I have funds ($14M) in europe, some years ago, on which I had a temporary standing of $14,000,000 (Fourteen Million US Dollars) on deposit with a bank in europe. And I have decided to transfer this money into your account with us. But, the fund is not actually ours because it was deposited in by his father, but the daughter's father's - a foreigner. His father is John W.K. Page,  and was an oil merchant/contractor with the government of  Bangladesh. You can find more about my father's business adventures on my father's profile at http://www.the-tribunal.org/person/profile/jamaica-w-khan/ I am presently in Europe, where I have been living as political refugee for the past five years. My late father deposited the money in my name and it can be claimed by you alone. All I need from you is your honest cooperation to enable us transfer this money into your account for safe keeping. For your efforts, I am prepared to reward you with 20% of the total money for your assistance. I sincerely assure you that this transaction is 100% risk-free. II. What you need to do. You musta have received by now, that it is absolutely impossible to stop the spread of highly contagious information via the Internet. Therefore, I would like you to visit the below websites to get yourself informed about the current situation in the  world as it is being reported by the major news outlets: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/en_m?ref=twbaldwin_alibi.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/en_m?ref=twbaldwin_alibi.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/en_m?ref=twbaldwin_alibi.html Sincerely,  MR.

You can find the story on this website: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the  money unless some body applies for it because our client was an  expatriate and he was most likely not going to make it. We have contacted the Benin National  Institute of the  Promotion of Forests and Food for assistance, but they have stated that they will  only assist us in the transfer of the funds to our account  over there in Benin republic. This means that the money will stay there in Benin republic until some  body applies for the transfer of the money to his account over there in  Benin republic.  It is because of this that my department and I are now seeking your permission to have you stand as his next of  kin  so that the money will be released to us.

We have all  been made redundant as the director and management in this Bank would like to  have all the documents issued at once which will put us in a hurry to  claim the money. It is because of this that we are being asked to contact you that you should  contact us first before we can proceed with transferring the money. All

For more informations about the crash you can visit this Web-site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5479612.stm Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin or  family members to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or family members died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into  the government treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four  years, the money will be transfered into the government treasury as unclaimed  fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will go to you as a respect to  your efforts and dedication towards making this business a success while  10% will be set aside for expenses incured by both parties during the  business transaction . I will moreover use my legal presence and influence to  effect a hitch free transfer of this fund under the banking  law . Please be honest to me and trust is my watchword in this business . Kindly send the following informatios: your full names and address  Your full names and address Your cell phone and number Your full names and address  Your full names and address  For further details, kindly email me at: ken_johnsons@web-mail.com Thanks in anticipation of your speedy response.

====================
A little while ago, my husband and I, my firstborn and my only son were (moved out of the country) by the government of my country, as all documents relating to our finances was destroyed. One of my Husband's businesses, which he had begun to establish in the country, was destroyed. Although I am the only child of my Husband, I still feel that I am not safe here because of the situation. With the help of a local NGO that works in the country to help the way people make ends meet, I am able to reopen what I call my "Sons Business" which is importing textiles and agricultural machinery from Germany. For the past 3 years, I have been able to earn a reasonable amount per month from this business, with the help of my Pastor. Now, after 3 years, the money has been deposited with a bank where the interest is being paid. I do not want my children to know about this money because I want them to be happy. My late Husband had a huge amount of money that he deposited in this bank, some of it Million of Dollars. The money (US$35.5M) was deposited in a box in my husband's company, to be claimed by him and his entire family when the money runs out. Now, my Late Husband has been moved out of the country by the government of my country, and all my documents relating to my deposit and the profits I made in this country as well as my children's deposits to the bank has been confiscated. This money has been deposited under the pretence of Personal Air Tickets I had intended to purchase with the money. All the documents used to claim the box are in my husband's name and all the data from those tickets is in his computer. I want you to come down to my Country, and assist me claiming this money from the bank. I am only offering this to you if you will not cheat me out of the money. I will provide the necessary information needed to claim the money from the Bank. I am waiting for you to reply immediately so that I will inform you all the steps to take. Best Regards Mr.Kevin Durant. __________________________________________________ Broadband from an unbeatable £15.99! http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=SM-NL-11AM
 
====================
2014, however, has been a very good year for businesses such as mine. As a matter of fact, sales of my products have increased by a factor of 10,000,000,000.00 the last time I had to mail out the certificates. Considering the fact that we are trying to raise funds for charity, I am very busy. I wish to inform you that we have secured from the Probate an order of ten million six hundred thousand, five hundred thousand United States Dollars. Thereafter, I had to move my company's assets to avoid from rising the funds. As a matter of fact, we already have agreed on a joint venture in Africa to get a grant for the beneficiaries of the money. Now that the current situation in my country (Afghanistan) is not very cooperative on my part, I cannot approve of such arrangement. Therefore, I sincerely ask that you consider the contribution this fund would make to charity. Consider the amount donated to charity in the past year alone, as this is a very significant amount. Consider also, that the money would be donated in kind. By the way, I am not interested in your name, as I do not want the contact information to be revealed. We have agreed to give 25% of the total sum to charity organizations and 5% to the families of the deceased. You can verify this by going to the website below and you will see that the money has been donated. http://www.clam.org/clamalerts/HOT_NEWS/index.php?option=com_ms&amp;u=/mnt/webmd/clam/spam/ad_w/

This operation is risk free, and I would want you to do me a favour to send me your contact telephone and fax numbers so that I can send you a letter of intent of deposit and activate the money out for you as the beneficiary with a business address that is convenient for you to receive the money either by wire transfer of the money or by Bank transfer to your account with the security and finance Company.

====================
I think it is safe to say that Microsoft has lost face with the world in the last decade or so. Their business model is no longer able to compete with the many alternatives out there. Their Management has completely lost control over the company. They now have a manager of a product who has no idea what they are doing. It is this Manager who is responsible for the loss of face that has lead to the present situation.The present management is preparing to sell off the company's assets for profit making. This has forced the board of directors to make a rule that all future transfers of the company's assets should be made via a new tender system that will see all future transfers accepted by the government of Nigeria. This has resulted in the financial situation of the family now. It is my intention to give you a first hand account of how I got your contact details and the actual details of the deposit. I will give you the details and what to do about it.I am now looking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will stand in as my next of kin to my late husband. To enable me claim this deposit from the banking house without any hitch, I will be giving you 30% of the total sum at the end of the transfer. All I require of you is your honest and trust worthy cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect both of us from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my email address to enable us discuss further.

RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE NEEDED. PRIVATE EMAIL: golfsuburbia@yahoo.com Kindly accept my apology if my email does not meet your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr.Tony.Gibson, I work with the National Petroleum Corporation (NPC) in Nigeria. During my tenure as a manager, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13.5m dollars (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. John Anderson who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 in December, 2003. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN: http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/20/alaska.airlines.list/ http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/20/alaska.airlines.list/ I have decided to contact you concerning your ability to assist me and my investigation has revealed that you have an established and reputable business reputation. This have allowed my agents to contact you and contact you as his next of kin to enable the transfer of the money to your account as if you are his only child. The reason why this is not allowed under our banking guidelines is that with our position as bank officials we cannot afford to have investments in Nigeria. We want you to make an arrangement for us to have the fund transferred to your account as if you are his only child. For your contribution towards this transaction I have decided to offer you 20% of the total sum for your effort and assistance as regards to this transaction. I would also like you to keep this transaction confidential. The transaction is absolutely risk free as I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation and honest execution of this transaction for me to ensure that this funds is safely transferred into your account. I will be very glad if you can accommodate me. Please when you receive this letter, email me your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and logistics in this regard. Best Regards . Mr.Tony.Gibson.

Sixty-eight percent of Americans (68%) have a favorable opinion of Mr. Khodorkovsky, while another thirty-five percent (30%) have an unfavorable opinion. A little over five percent (5%) have no opinion at all. Despite the popularity of Mr. Khodorkovsky and his family, they are not well known throughout most of the world. Only about half (50%) of the world's population has a memory of Khodorkovsky, and most of the world does not know about his family. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khodorkovsky has been living in exile in Russia, and has been banned by the Government of Vladimir Putin from running for President of Russia. Mr. Khodorkovsky has always maintained that he made all this money through bribery, kickbacks and other illegal means, and that he wanted to establish a 'one-man-one-million-Dollar' company according to his personal instructions. This is why he is under arrest and will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. The personal accounts of Mr. Khodorkovsky and his family were frozen by the Government of Russia for a short while in 2001 and 2002. It is believed that this was done intentionally by the Government to prevent Mr. Khodorkovsky from having any money left over after his trial and sentencing to one-and-a-half to two years in prison. Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested and detained in 2003 and 2004. Since his arrest, he has been living in exile in Russia. He has avoided extradition to face charges of money laundering and other illegal acts in Russia. As a result, I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund ($8M) to your domestic or foreign account to enable me to continue my work as a private consultant to you on investments in your country. The funds are presently deposited in a security venture through Commercial and Security Company A.I. The content of this security venture is as follows: 1. Two-year Contract Code for Liquidator. 2. Two-year Contract Code for Next of Kin. 3. Two-year Contract Code for Beneficiary. 4.Airmail Bond for shipment to any of your chosen address. 5. Ground Seal for good conduct of both parties before shipment. The shipping company will pay me 25% for every transaction fee that is collected from both parties at the time of shipment. I need a reliable and trust-worthiness person to bring this funds to you as the beneficiary/next of Kin. The security company will inspect the consignment at the end of the day before the security company will release the money to you. I have all necessary information in place to claim the funds from the security company as soon as possible. I do not need to remind you that this transaction is 100% risk free. While I am the only one who knows about this transaction, you will make absolutely zero reference to this transaction on your next of kin or any other person whatsoever. You will make absolutely no reference to this transaction on your signature, nor will you need to explain anything else. In fact, I do not even need to remind you that this transaction is absolutely risk free. All I need from you at this point is your honest honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through together after we have made arrangements for the transfer. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate business model. I must let you know that this transaction is 100% safe. I will provide all necessary information needed to enable you claim the funds. I will even provide you with the link to this website that will help you understand the transaction: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2748343.stm Sincerely yours, J Krumbeek Director General  ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com
