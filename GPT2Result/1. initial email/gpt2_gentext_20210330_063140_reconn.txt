According to my data, this product was originally supplied to you by my late client (who was a foreigner) and is now worth about $3,000.00 USD. However, due to my client's assassination by the junta rebels, as a result of the cease fire agreement which was reached with the help of Western nation, I was forced to sell my product to a local importer under the name of 'Wal-Mart'. He paid me $1,500.00 USD for the privilege of importing my product into his country and I am left with about $1,700.00 USD for importing the product into his country.

The owner of a jewellery store in Dubai - U.A.E. has been murdered by the agents of his bank and it is very sad as he was like a brother to him. His death has brought us all together to remember his life's work and his dreams.   His business and pleasure was to keep and sell high quality jewellery and beautiful necklaces and coins and he was killed by the greedy and greedy methods which are against all morality and god knows no man whatsoever. The owner of this business was Abdul Kadir, he was a businessman by trade and he especially loved and  devoted to his wife Fatimat who died in a mysterious airplane crash in 1990. But he was also an angel. He was a very sick man, but before his death, he told me of his big treasure he kept in a safe in his home and he told me about it once he was gone. He told me that he deposited the said box with the help of an Iranian diplomat and when he came back, he had enough money to last me and my wife till death. This he did not tell me until late last year, after a month, that he suddenly  died of cancer. My doctor told me that he had given up and that God was with him. My motivation to tell you now is to ensure that you receive this money with joy and not sorrow. I want you to send to me your phone and fax numbers to enable us to meet face to face to guarantee that you receive this money with joy and not sorrow.   Please be honest to me and I will send to you the documents that my doctor gave to me before they were destroyed by my lawyer. I want you to always pray for me because he has a revealed to me that God is with me and that He will see me through this. My new number is +97150511813. I will be waiting to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Mumtaz Ali. www.mysmutez.com (مرادة،مت)

Is there anything more satisfying than releasing a new version of an application that has already been approved by the previous version's developer and being able to use his/her code?  Developers often write software that is practically the same as the software that was originally written by programmers, but is often released under a different name and is often sold as "original software". In this case, the application has been officially renamed from time to time to move away from the original name. This has sometimes happened with originated applications such as Microsoft Word. For example, Microsoft Word.appeared to be renamed in Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and now you can download and run the free version of Windows 8.1 with all the old Microsoft Office applications.  We now have all the source code from the previous version of Windows 8, along with many other files that were left behind by the original developers of the applications.  We have published all the source code to the Repository , so that anyone can now try the application and download the files they left behind.  We have also published a link to download the application itself from Microsoft.com from your computer, so that you can also use their website to download and run the application.  Please note that the application itself was freely available to anyone with a working Internet connection.  This version is also fully compatible with all the applications that are still being used in the previous versions of Windows 8.  All that is required is to run the application and download the files. The application will automatically update itself to take care of all the changes that have been made in the software.  We have also included a backup copy of the application in case you decide to re-apply for a different computer and network connection.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  I shall be happy to answer them.  Please do not be afraid to contact me, I will be very glad to hear from you.  Please do not be shy, please do not be afraid to contact me. Just remember that it is a very serious matter and I need your full co-operation. Please, do not be afraid. I will be very happy if you can work with me and my team.'

30-year-old Korean man, who claims to have been abducted and held hostage by the terrorists of Free Syrian Army in recent days.The Free Syrian Army(F.S.A) is an anti-regime rebel group that fought against President Bashar al-Assad forces. After the cease fire agreement broke down in the weeks following the uprising, the Syrian government began its systematic killing and looting of civilian properties, most notably, Homs and Damascus. In retaliation, the Syrian government of President and F.S.A, openly defied the agreement, it shelled and destroyed several parts of the rebel held areas of Homs, Damascus and Hama province. In retaliation, the Syrian government of President and F.S.A, openly defied the agreement, it shelled and destroyed several parts of the rebel held areas of Homs, Damascus and Hama province. The death of my father, and the wounding of my mother, forced me and my younger sister out of the house and into government hands. I managed to escape to Lebanon illegally through the help of UN . As I write this, my life is in danger. The Syrian government and its allies are frantically searching for any of them. In my apprehension, the death of my father will bring about a halt to my life.But before his death, he instructed me to bury my father somewhere and he will be exempt from security deposit as security for his life. I have been thinking of burying my father in the next of kin as he instructed. But since now I know my father's location, I am moving my family out of the country. Meanwhile, I have decided to donate part of this fund to your charity organization for charity. I have decided not to confront the banks for the deposit as I am sure the banks will cover for us once I have the money in my possession. The banks have been harassing me for the past few weeks because of the urgent need to transfer the money. The last communication I had with them was on Monday, September 27, when I was on my way to the bank, they gave me assurances that my father's money and property will be released to me after I have transferred the money somewhere safe. I have contacted the bank and confirmed the safety of the consignments and that they will be released to me because I have confirmed my intention to donate part of my father's money to charity organizations. I have also contacted the security company to confirm the security of the consignments and that they will be released to me after I have transferred the money into my possession. As soon as I receive your positive response on this initiative, I will then get back to you as soon as possible. I will apply for a leave as soon as the money is transferred to you. I have decided to use my remaining stocks of D&amp;D to invest this money in your country. Your immediate response will be highly appreciated. Please, I await your response. Yours Faithfully, Jang Suke

New studies have shown that the presence of certain chemicals in our drinking water can disrupt our hormones, leading to serious health problems including infertility. A chemical treatment facility in the United States is trying to develop a way to kill all the microorganisms that cause these problems. But as it turns out, we don't have to go far to find out that chemicals in our drinking water can also be harmful. In fact, according to new studies, even very low levels of the agents used to treat pharmaceutical drugs can cause serious health problems like cancer, heart disease, stroke, and even death. And even though some pharmaceutical drugs are effective for certain diseases, such as cancer, they can also be harmful for others. For example, anti-cancer drugs such as prednisolone can be toxic to cells that are made of fat and fibrous material, and these substances can also accumulate in the fat and make the cells unstable. In addition, the researchers found that some pharmaceutical drugs can also be addictive, and some doctors are prescribing these addictive drugs to their patients. Drug abuse is a major public health problem in many Western Countries. To avoid these threats to our health, the World Health Organization and United Nations agreed in 1997 to develop a strategy to combat drug abuse and drug related related deaths. To this end, they have encouraged governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce taxes paid for various drugs, and to invest and create jobs in areas related to research and development in non-public institutions. In many countries government-run drug rehabilitation and drug abuse treatment centers are full of addicts and their families, many of the which are suffering from drug related diseases. While some countries have made great efforts to combat drug abuse and drug related related related diseases, as well as to provide drug free work environments, others have not. One of the biggest factors hindering the development of effective treatments for drug abuse is government's current attitude toward rehabilitating drug addicts. As a result, many drug addicts are locked up in chronic pain hospitals and other long-term facilities where they suffer for their addiction. According to new research being conducted by a group of researchers led by Dr. Steven Bello at Harvard University, it may be possible to restore drug addiction to the patient through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. By combining anthelmintic agents (dextromethorphan and methadone hydrochloride) with psychological therapies, psychotherapists, and other professionals, these researchers managed to restore a patient's lost ability to function as a male. The patients included in the study were men who had been diagnosed with prostate, esophageal and esophageal cancer. According to the research results, restoring normal sex drive in men is possible and well tolerated. "The discovery of anti-androgen receptor antigens in the gonads and other organs has led to increased research on how to treat men with gonorrhoea, but none of these treatments has ameliorated the underlying diseases that are the cause of this problem. For example, men with prostate and esophageal cancer have a 80 percent chance of living for at least five years after they receive treatment, while men with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other forms of cancer have a ten percent chance of surviving for at least two years," Bello explains. "I have therefore been studying the development of new drugs that would combat the effects of these diseases on my body, and I believe that I have identified a promising molecule that would combat both gonorrhoea and cancer," Dr. Steven Bello

MURRAY PRINCE, I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy. But I do hope you will understand why I have decided to contact you. I am URGENTLY told by the doctor that I have only a few weeks to live, I am so miserable and depressed I cannot even close my eyes, I have not slept well all week, and I have not even eaten for two days. I feel like I am going to die, I have no idea what to do now, I have no one to run to, I have no home to go to, I don't even know where I am going. I don't want God to be with me now. I don't want God to know my secret, I don't want God to know that I am fine I am going to die. I don't want God to know that I have hidden my soul away in the bosom of my wife, I don't want God to know that I have willed and given alms to the charity work for God, I don't want God to know that I am even contemplating what to do to support myself now that I am in a better health, I don't want God to know that I have used my last dollar to support my wife and my three children, I don't want God to know that I have anyfucking idea where I am going to get the $25,000,000.00 USD from the Bank, I don't want God to know that I have such a cunt, I don't want God to know that I have such a baby, I don't want God to know that I have made such a mess of my life, I don't even know where I am going to sleep now, I am so fucking depressed. I don't even know where to send the money, I don't want there to be anybody that will take it from me, because I don't want God to know that I am rich. I don't even know where I am going to invest it.I don't even know if I will even use up all the funds, because I don't want to waste my time and effort.I just want this fucking money to be transferred to the Bank where the Bank will redeem the Fund for you. And I will even use my last cent to sponsor a Baptist church, that will propagandize the work of God by preaching the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me, I will rely on you and you alone. I am happy that you are a Christian so I will not deny you, but if you ask me to stay where I am, I will say no, I want the BANK to redeem the Fund for me and I will use my last cent for my expenses, while BANK will  redeem the Fund for me. You can contact me on the telephone number jeffrey_wales03@yahoo.co.uk or by emailing jeffrey_wales03@yahoo.co.uk with your full details below. Kindly redress this letter to my office for further steps to take, and I will give you the contact of the BANK. I will be there at the receipt of your response as soon as possible. Thanks and God bless you. jeffrey_wales03@yahoo.co.uk

According to my calculations, he has the sum of US$ 27.5 million in total. However, due to my position in the Sierra-leone National Government, for security reasons I have made arrangement to bring about the transfer of the money into a foreign account of your choice, where it will be safe until I receive proper approval and verification from the concerned ministries. I have decided to bring out part of the money to start a new life in your country or anywhere else where I will invest it. I have made all arrangement to do this in time for the transfer, once the money reaches your account. I shall disclose to you the amount that is in my account at this concessional rate of interest of 5% per annum. Each of us will be entitled to 10% of this amount immediately we are satisfied with your responsiveness and willingness to assist me.I will wait for your full co-operation to enable us see this deal through.

====================
Can I Accept This?  Dear, although I understand the disappointment of having to give this request to someone you do not know personally, but do not give up hope! It is only through faith that I am able to see this opportunity presented before me. I am Mrs. Adulla Motili ,the wife of late President Motili of Sierra-leone in Sierra-leone. As you are probably aware, my late husband was the personal aid to the late president of Sierra-leone, Mr. Abdul Maqsoud. However, I will like you to know that he was killed along side with my only son in the air crash that occured in November 22nd, 2000, in the village of Ebony. As you are probably aware, my late husband was among the few rich farmers murdered in the air crash. Before the death of my husband, he deposited with me some amount of thirty Million U.S. Dollars which he valued at Twenty Four Thousand Eight hundred,000 dollars. You may be wondering how I got these funds, as I don't have any child yet. The truth is that I have been keeping these fund in a security company in Europe for security reason, since I don't want to travel there to collect the funds myself because of the danger. By the way, The funds are the fruit of his agricultural land which was confiscated by the rebels during the civil war. In 2003, my husband's heir was also killed in the air crash. I therefore, seek your permission and assistance to move the funds out of the Security Company in Europe for safekeeping, before they get confiscated again as I have decided to move this fund abroad once again for investment purpose. You can only reach me with this email address:a_m_motili@sify.com You can also reach you with this telephone number: +221-54788100 you should send me your confidential telephone/fax numbers to enable me to contact you more on this issue. Thanks and God bless you as you consider my plea. Yours faithfully, Mrs. Adulla Motili
 
====================
Here's my theory on life. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. My husband is dead and I  don't want them to know about this development. I know that this will come to you as a surprise because we don't  know ourselves before, but be sure that it's real and a possibility. I want to tell you that this money is mine and my husband inherited it from his  late father My late husband, Mr. Sterling Brown. This was a secret and very good deal because the  transaction is irreversible if I do not remit the money urgently. My  late husband is now in a private residence in England, and as soon as I receive  your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that will  enable me prove that the money is mine and there is no need for a Bank Representative in this  transaction. All that I need from you is to ensure that this fund is  remitted to you urgently. If you feel you can do this for me, feel free to give your  reply. I will wait for your response as I await the best possible moment to contact you. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that will  enable me put you in possession of the money immediately it reaches you. Please assure me that you will act honestly and  responsibly and do not put me at a loss. I will like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. Well my name is Mrs. Teresa Johnson, I am the Wife of late Mr.Brown jr., from Sierra Leone. I am the mother of David, who was recently killed in the plane crash. Prior to the death of my husband in an air crash with another pilot on January, 2000, he was a very rich merchant/business man in Sierra Leone. He was one of the few in Sierra Leone and probably the richest in Sierra Leone. But he was killed during the conflict and all his properties and assets was seized on January 19th 2001 . I am saddled with the problem of securing the release of my late husband deposit and also securing my freedom. It is a long, painful and sorrowful ordeal, but I got through to you for assistance. You assisted me to secure the release of my late husband deposit, which is 20 million dollars. I am now seeking your permission to remit this amount to you as soon as we proceed with this transaction, in the hope that you will also help me to secure a political asylum in your country.  Before my last respite I shall send to you our itinerary so that you can follow us. I will also like a mutual benefit agreement between us, so that you will help me secure the deposit and remit it to me. I will give you a PDF of the contract that will be executed in your name as compensation for your assistance during this process. Please, I implore you to spare two minutes to enable me transfer this money and also to enable me cover any expenses that will be incurred in the course of this transaction. I will be waiting for your immediate response. Sincerely yours, Mrs. Teresa Johnson.

====================
I want to order a custom woodworking kit from you. I am Mr Chiwetalu Philips a National of Zimbabwe. And my name is Mr Chiwetalu Philips a National of Zimbabwe, I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my trade. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my trade. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (U.S.$ 10.5m) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% as remuneration for your assistance. I will be posting a request for your personal details as soon as I receive your reply. I will be expecting to hear from you soon. Thank you and God bless. Yours Faithfully Revd. Fr. Mr Chiwetalu Philips.

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not helping me.

Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.

Resident Evil: The Game takes the series to new levels by allowing you to play as Arnold James, a man who escaped the sinking of the Titanic and made his way to Argentina where he eventually made his fortune.Arnold James must now put his trust in God as he must seek for a Godly God to guide and protect his life and also concentrate on his business as he never wanted to lose his ability to deal.To accomplish his mission, Arnold had to make a lot of money during his short time in South America.First, he sold his old shipyard and built his own ship which sank in 1996 killing everyone on board.The second fatality was when his ship broke up over 2000 years ago and sunk into the sea without a survivor. Now, nobody knows who killed him or why he died. This is because the Titanic legend has it that the cursed boat sank into the sea because of the evil spirits aboard. Now, nobody knows if this is true or not. And nobody knows anything about it either because nobody came to claim it. Now, all of South America is his new and trusted land of residence. Aside from his business, Arnold also has a passion for giving out charity from the proceeds of his various sales. If this is not enough for you, he also runs a wonderful evangelical church where he dedicates his time to God. If you are willing to work for this man,we are prepared to offer you 10% of the total money or 25% of the fund for any expenses that might be incurred during the process of this transaction, depending on how things pan out. Please contact me immediately through my e-mail address (arthurjames4@yahoo.co.uk) if you are willing to help me and also tell me your full private telephone/fax numbers, and also tell me what kind of a Christian you are, in order that I will let you know exactly what I need to do to make this a success.

The problem with allowing people to run amok like this is that they and their ilk are not under the control of any government and they may very well continue to operate like this for some time to come. I therefore seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to this fund and so we can work in cahoots with you to effect a swift and proper release of this money and transfer it over to your account overseas for investment. I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this claim and I will give you more information if I hear from you. I will like to be able to talk about this issue to a group of people at least once a week for a  minimum of three months.  The reason I want to introduce you is that other people may be intimidated by my situation and think twice before I tell them to transfer this money or that they should move it to an overseas accounts or some other safe place because this money is my life savings. I want you to help me to move this money out of Bangladesh and put it into any safe account you will provide for me since I will not be able to come over here but I will talk to you later if I am offered the opportunity to do so. I will be very much glad if you can assist me to receive this money into your account overseas. I will send you my full details once I receive your positive reply.I will also like to know if there is anything else I can do for you that will be of benefit to me as well. Your quick response will be appreciated. If you can not come over here, kindly inform me of your unwillingness to work with me and I will get someone else over there as quickly as possible. I will report back to you as soon as possible. thanks and God bless you. Yours sincerely Mr.Abdul Hakim.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday became the latest Arab nation to condemn the killing of a prominent anti-government activist by the Saudi-led anti-government rebellion, an attack that has so far killed dozens.
 
====================
The decision by the Federal Government of Nigeria in Nigeria to allow foreign contractors to effectively operate the country's oil sector may be a political one, but it is based on good business sense. It has indeed been a long time coming, but finally, the day has finally come. I am writing you in good faith and trust, and hoping that you will treat this as very urgent business. As the head of state of Nigeria, I am obliged to solicit the good faith of foreign contractors, who are constrained from operating their companies openly in this country, lest they incur huge expenditure and blacken the good name of Nigeria. The present inefficient contracting procedures in this country renders it impossible for the contractor to get his or her funds out of this country, unless they transfer it into a foreign account. Needless to say, this procedure has been in place for some time now and the funds have been locked up in the escrow account of the Nigerian consignment company. I am Mr. Rufekadu Abacha I, the personal secretary to the former finance and industrial co-ordinator Mr. Jonathan. Jonathan. This is how it went down for the Nigerian contractors. At first, the Nigerian consortium, after they secured the supply contract, presented me as the foreign subcontractor, but the Nigerian Government had already prohibited all foreign firms from bidding on the same contracts as Nigeria National Petroleum. Consequently, I as the foreign subcontractor was able to secure the contract and be awarded it to a foreign firm whose name is clearly known to the Nigerian Government:  Hoeienga Fertilizer. We, the contractors, are therefore seeking a foreign partner with the ability and ability to exercise all necessary control over the contract award and execution. This is requiring financial backing and we seek your permission to use your name as the foreign beneficiary of the contract so that financial backing can be secured and then the contract can be transferred to your name.  please reply to our Affidavit of Authority to enable us proceed with the Transaction. Meanwhile, we have all necessary legal documents that will enable us present you as the bona fide foreign beneficiary of the contract. Finally, we have all necessary  contacts at the Nigerian consignment company who will be using your name as the beneficiary of the contract. All case studies are being worked out before our very eyes. This transaction is guaranteed to be 100% risk free. The only restriction is that we shall only be allowed to operate on the contract funds acquired from the Nigerian consignment company. This is to avoid a situation where after the transaction, your company will be required to transfer the funds into another account, which the Nigerian consigment will have to approve. If you are interested, kindly reach me and I shall initiate the process with my contacts at the Nigerian consignments company. Thanking you very much for your co-operation. Yours Faithfully, Mr. Rufekadu Abacha

The way I see it, here's how it works. First, we negotiate a down payment on the amount. Then we negotiate a joint ownership with the Bank. Finally, when all is said and done, you take 35% of the total fund as your share.   I can't say more than that, because I don't want to upset the Bank. Now I just need you and the Bank to work out percentages. I'll give you more details about how this will be done.   I want to let you know that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free, since I contacted you with facts and information that will be used to make the down payment and subsequent joint ownership application. I'm also willing to work with you to make this a success, preferably you would come here to the Bank to work with me and you can also contact me with your opinion for future steps to take.   You can reach me with your private telephone: +221 419 51552 or +858-502-293 .   You can also send to me your private conversations using the Email address below.   mrs_vincent_pyles@yahoo.co.in. Thank you very much. My sincere, Mrs. Vincent P. Pyles.

I have contacted you based on the fact that you have the same last name as my client and that we have the same birth date. I want you to be the one to pick up the phone and call my client to help me to ship the funds to you. The funds will be delivered to you in your name. I will admit that I have picked your name out of the hat and I did not know that you were going to be the one to deliver the funds to you, but now I know, I have made up my mind that you will pick me as the beneficiary of the sum. Later I shall not take any part in the business until I am sure that you will be capable of assisting me in placing the funds in your name. Please I intend to use my last bit of money and go into business ventures in your country or any other for I have decided that my nam...

The condition of the deceased's property is also a issue in the case. The funds and property have been jointly produced by my late client and I. My investigation established that the deceased had a fixed deposit of US$10,000,000.00 (Ten million Five hundred thousand United states dollars) with an unclaimed sum of US$17,500,000 (Thirteen hundred thousand United dollars only) remaining in a bank here in Senegal. The funds were moved into this bank through a diplomatic means, the method of my investigation revealed that the deceased had deposited the funds before he died through the help of a new partner from the Republic of Senegal. My investigation also established that the deceased had transferred his share of the funds out of the bank before his death, this was to avoid paying income tax in this country and country of his origin. I am therefore contacting you to seek your assistance as a foreigner to help me screen the money and eventualy move it into your account abroad before the funds get the authority to engage in investment. For this, I need your full cooperation and fullest co-operation to make this work well. We shall discuss the modalities behind this transaction once it has been approved and I have convinced my partner of the funds to move into your account.   If you can't do this job for me, please tell me where you got the money. I will then come over and cede the rights to you. I will also send my complete cooperation to your entire documentation on how this money will be managed and transferred to your account. I will also issue you a letter of authorisation so that you can finalize the funds directly to me. I will also issue you a letter of authorisation to enable you receive payments.   Thanks and remain bless in the Lord. Yours faithfully, Mr Robert Brownlee.

New Delhi,18th of December,2009. A lady by the name of MRS MAR IAN WILLIAMS has been begging God to make her last day a holyday for three years now. After 3 years, she died. Her cause of death was confirmed to be myelodysplastic syndrome (MDSS) by a private medical doctor who examined her after taking her last breath.

The original creators of this web-page, Mr. Ken Brown and Mrs. Marianne Brown , have since passed away, leaving no trace behind. However, since their deaths we have made several enquiries to locate any of their relatives. After several unsuccessful attempts, we finally located the Daughters of Ken and Marianne Brown in Kuwait. The Daughters of Ken and Marianne Brown are now free and living in Kuwait . Due to the abundance of financial documents relating to the late donors, we have decided to distribute the fund among the charity organisations for the work of God. We are giving you 30% of the fund, 5% will be set out for expenses incurred in the course of this mission, and the remaining 70% is for my immediate family and I as well as 7% for expenses we will make in the course of this operation. We don't want this fund to go into the coffers of the Ministry of  Finance or the Ministry of  Works, because those funder are supposed to be the ones that will  distribute the fund once the fund has been distributed to charity organisations.  We need you to help us collect the documents related to the fund and dispatch them to charity organisations for the work of God.   NOTE: Please, I sincerely ask you to please help us to collect the documents and dispatch them to the charity organisations for the  work of God.  If you are not interested in assisting us in this matter, kindly  decline to help us and go your own way. If, on the other hand, you are interested in assisting us, kindly  forward to us your telephone and fax numbers and I will give you all necessary information and Duties to send the fund to  the charities. I will give you further details if we become  acquainted. Please, I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter,  because I do not want to let  anybody down and all this I want to do is Godly. Please, I implore you to  keep this confidential. Please, Kindly contact me back through my Email address ( maryandjennifer99@she.com ) this will  give you more information about the next step and also share a kiss if you  are good enough to do this.

====================
The owner of a late Mrs Rose Allen died and was succeeded in the family by her son. She was a very devoted Christian and a very devoted Missionary. When her late husband was alive, he  disposed of his fund in one of the  Missionary  Institutions. Unfortunately, my late- husband died in August 2004 of an  emboliated hemorrhoid, and since then my  doctor has warned me about the possibility of my  dying, having  lost my ability to  talk and to hear clearly.  Having known my  condition, I have been  living in a vegetative state in a laterologium,  for the better care of my children.  I have decided to donate this fund to either  a Christian Organization or a  devoted Christian individual that will utilize  this money the way  I am going to instruct here- in. I want this Christian Organization or Individual to use this  fund in all sincerity to fund churches,  orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and keeping  the faith pure. The Bible made us  to  take  special care of money,  telling us that "Blessed is the hand that  giveth".I saw this derniel and I was tempted to use it for  personal enrichment but I knew that it  would be used in the interest of God. I took this  decision because I don't have any child  that will inherit this money and my husband's  relatives are all Muslims and I don't want  my husband's hard earned money to be misused by  unbelievers for their personal enrichment. I took  this decision because I don't want  my husband's efforts to be used in an  ungodly manner. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  unholy manner hence the reason for  taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God  and there will be  no ungodly influence on my faith. I don't want  my husband's efforts to be used in an  unholy manner either,  I know that  the Almighty  will be piously  blessed with every  blessed thing. With God, I  will  wait for the call to  come through from you. Please  reply me urgently so that I will send the necessary  Document concerning this transaction through  the appropriate  diplomatic channels. I will refuse to  contact any person until I am sure of  my faith hence the reason for  taking this bold decision. Call me immediately  if you wish to discuss further this  matter. I will be waiting for your response  via email if you are  willing to do this transaction. I guarantee that  this will be executed under an  honest, trustworthy person with the full co-operation of  the Almighty. I want  you to know that there is a sense of  security as we proceed with this transaction. I  found out that the beneficiary of this fund is not  aware of the source of this fund, nor even  the nature of the transaction,  which is my fault because I should have known better than to  involve the Foreign  Account before the beneficiary could receive  the fund. As a result of  this investigation, I now know that the beneficiary of this  fund is not even his legal beneficiary,  his lawyer, because the advice he received from  the Bank was to remit the fund into the account of  his friend instead. I now want you to  help me in clearing this fund and into your  safe account. As soon as I  hear from you, I will then come over to your country  and we will share the  fund by mutual agreement of both of us.After the  funds get into your safe account, I will send to you a  copy of the Certificate of Deposit.I will also arrange that  after 10 years you will be allowed to come over to  my country on my behalf as a tourist.Please  reply to my private email: jerry5111@yahoo.co.uk  if you are willing to do this business with me. I will be waiting for your response as soon as possible. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, JERRY OZANE.

New Horizons is currently in the Pluto system in the neighborhood of L4,545,000 km². This distance does not include Pluto's largest moon, Charon, which is about 590,000 km². The distance is due to an imbalance in the gravity which causes the moon to scream for attention as it constantly tries to exert its gravitational pull on New Horizons. If we do not find a solution soon, New Horizons will pass behind Charon and vanish from view. However, New Horizons will visit Pluto in October, 2015 and make discoveries of geologically significant bodies including methane hydrates, which will be the raw material for the creation of new life on Earth. See more about New Horizons discovery at NewHorizons.org

Federico Lopez, 54, was a business man and a member of the National Assembly of Liberia before his death. He was one of the few black farmers in the country and the farmer and his wife both died in the plane crash that took place on December 31, 2005 in the town of Monrovia. We gathered in the city to lay flowers to his memory. The day before the crash, we were attacked by the rebel forces loyal to the government of President Charles Taylor. The rebels attacked our farm and killed some of our comrades and some of the President's goons. Later, the rebels took Colonel Ahmed teki from the town and killed him at the field and also forced us out of our home. I am writing this letter because I have been trying to establish contact with a responsible person abroad for the past 3 months now and have been unsuccessful. Before the death of my father, he instructed me to get a trustworthy foreigner who will assist me to transport and send to you the sum of ($15,500,000.00USD) which he deposited in a finance company in Europe some years ago. He instructed me that I should solicit your assistance in the transfer of this money because of the war in my country and also for investment purpose. As I was thinking about how to accomplish this task, my friend mentioned that my late father had in his possession some amount of money that was twenty five million united states dollars, which he intended to transfer to your account on my behalf. I have been thinking of how to send the money to your account but with each passing day, I learn more and more about my late father and the corrupt people in the country. I finally decide to get you involved, while I wait for your reply. Please, note that all communication will be through my E-mail because it is the most obvious and efficient method of communication, while you will use my private e-mail address (federico_lopez2000@yahoo.com) for our usual business transactions. Finally, remember to keep the secrecy of this transaction very high, because I am convinced that once my late father receives this money from you, he will be more than happy to use it for his investment in your country, while I only want to avail myself of this opportunity to secure my future and that of my children. I will be most glad if you can render me assistance immediately I hear from you that you understand my plight and also want to come over to my assistance. Yours Faithfully, Mr. Federico Lopez

My version of events is that Sir Winston Churchill and other senior government officials were present at my father's death and after my father was taken into custody, they were all killed by the rebels. Before my father's death he had a fixed deposit of £15,500,000 (Fifteen million Five hundred thousand Pounds Sterling).

$10,500,000.00 (Ten million five hundred thousand Dollars) Was deposited by my late father in a security company in Dania in December 1991 and since then no one knows of it.The money is in a bank vault of the type used for security company's deposit and there are no known relatives/colleagues of my father around. He deposited the vault with a prime bank in UAE and no one knows of it except me and my mother who was his secretary at the time. My father told me that he did this to protect the identity of the funds and to help him escape responsibility as all his family and friends were against him due to his relationship with the former president . The funds were deposited with a prime bank in UAE for safe keeping for him and for investment in foreign banks and on his advice I decided to move to UAE to continue my education. As it is my wish to support a cause that I believe in, I have decided to invest this money in a good business as I cannot reinvest the funds in my own country due to my late father's relationship with the ex president and with the political instability in that country. I have decided to relocate to UAE to further my education and also to further my business experience since I do not want my father's funds to be used in a bad business. I have in mind to invest this money into a good business in the emirate or anywhere else where I will be highly compensated for the investment. Meanwhile, I will be willing to relocate this fund to your emirate for your assistance and also to invest in any other business you suggest. Please, I need your immediate assistance as this is the only thing I can really rely on now. This is because of the uncertainty in emirate in regard of the future of my father funds and also of my relationship with my father that is currently not good.

LONDON (VIA MODESTO)  - Tonight I managed to get a good spot in London, to witness the beginning of one of the biggest riots in the London borough of Lambeth since the death of late Mayor Michael Howard.

 
====================
AUGUSTA, SEPTEMBER 1996. A SELF-Willed MAN has been charged over the deaths of his wife and three children. The ill-fated couple were involved in a car accident and unfortunately, their lives were cut short. The tragic incidents happened in Portugal and the Republic of Sierra-Leone. Mr. Fernando Perez, 52, was driving his wife and three children along a rural road when they were involved in a fatal car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Mr. Perez was a member of the former president of Liberia, Charles Taylor's so-called troika group of friends who lived in good terms with the Cote d’Ivoire government at the height of their popularity in the wake of the deaths of Charles Taylor and other war criminals. In his final days, Charles Taylor had told his followers that they should stay away from Mr. Perez' family home in Cotonou, but they were all killed. In his final moments, Charles Taylor had told his followers that the Perez family would not be his friends because they are all black. His last words were that he wished all those who killed him would stay dead and he told them to go back to Africa or else he would have them all. Before his death, he had told body of his plans to leave the burden of his wicked crimes on to his descendants. Now his descendants are bringing his body to Cotonou, Benin Rep. Forces attached to the military took possession of the Perez' home and are attempting to remove the body from the home. Cotonou Rep. Oficial: Charles Taylor

Email: suso_moco@yahoo.co.uk Dear Friend,  I am sure will be of great help to you in this business,which I know will be of great interest to you given the nature of our business.In the event that you decide to deal with me personally, I would like to get your relationship with me into order so that we could commence a proper business transaction. I was moved by my innermost desire to choose you as my partner over other suitors for mutual benefits,  because you have such different lives to me. I am Mr. Suso a 24 years old man from Liberia in West Africa. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer that was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well due to illness and neglect. I was a devoted husband to my wife, but who was never able to meet the children I wanted for my family. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I have not really lived my life as a happy man, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself), but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seventhousand U.S Dollars ($10,000.000.00) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside the amount for your small and big help. I will also be looking for a trustworthy person who will help us to put this deposit into good trust for the humblest of causes. I pray to God that you help us to help these poor people and send donations of your own money to them. Please, I beg you in Christ to help us to put this money into good faith, and forward your information as directed below. Yours sincerely, Suso

On the 12th of April 2005, I was on my way to work in London when I was involved in a car accident along Ilford Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. I since have been living in a very difficult home environment as my only son and I have been battling to survive as my only hope now is in fund raising for us. My late son has left me all I have. What I would like to relate to you now is very personal as we have not known or met ourselves previously.I will like you to be my partner and help me retrieve these funds from the Financial Institution.You will be working hand in hand with me in this transaction as my partner will take charge of the withdrawing and I will do the same for you. It depends on how much we can agree on. We will both come to a compromise on how much we will each invest in a mutual agreement between us. After the funds are withdrawn and credited to your account, we shall split the funds 50-50.50. Should you be willing to help me, please write me back so that I will know how to proceed. If you are not, I will be very glad. I will appreciate that you will send me your confidential telephone number, so that I will call you. Thank you very much. Yours Faithfully, Mrs Faith
 
====================
We have been told that this would be the end of the story if we do not accept to work with you. But the last thing I want is for this money to be traced or claimed from the bank, because that is when  the bank is going to prosecute and confiscate this money. I told them that I will only accept payment in kind if I can directly affect such a good business relationship between us. They assured me that they will not let me down and I should trust them. I have therefore been striving all this time to reach a good business agreement with them. But now I know that I am not alone in this quest, because there is another man with me, Roberto Martinez, a native of Sierra Leone, who is currently awaiting to be transferred to your country for investment . I am here to inform you that you are a partner in a good business opportunity that will provide you with huge income and opportunity. I will tell you everything that I have to do to make sure that all the necessary approvals are in place before you can apply and convince the bank to release the funds to me. You need to understand that I will not allow such money to be traced through any means or man, especially not through the help of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Please, you need to help me to transfer this money into your care. You will be rewarded with 20% of the total sum for your assistance. I'm writing to let you know that there is a high probability that the funds will be released to your personal care for your assistance. Please, understand that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both of us. I want to assure you once again that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to you, too. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in Sierra Leone until you confirm the funds, and I will try my best to get to you as quickly as I can. If you are able and capable to help me, kindly give me your permalink, I have decided to give you the percentage of 10% of the total amount we shall remit into your care before we begin any investment because I don't want to spend money I don't know how long I have to wait to get this funds transferred. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, Joe. Gibbons

I am a citizen of Cameroon. I just resigned my job as a research scientist at the National Cancer Institute in Abidjan - Cote D Ivoire and I now take n ies of sick leave to take part in some humanitarian work in the hope to see this project through. During one of my sick off days, I was on a research project at the NIH. As I was l I was researching on the Oncogene gene on cancer stem cell treatment. I stumbled across a gene and its interaction and I discovered that it codes for a protein called p24.I have since been on a mission to get any one who has this gene as well as relatives or close friends of my family, for testing and I managed to locate one person who has the gene. I have decided to contact you on this project of getting these genetic material out of Cote D Ivoire so that I can come over to your country to further my education and to help out my family on the run from the government and it's loyalists who are persecuting my family. In order to start the process of collecting this genetic material, I need your assistance in collecting the Funds from the investors and then I will collect the genetic material from the investors and deliver to you on demand. I will also like to know your opinion about collecting these Funds from the investors before they is transferred to your account. Your honest assistance and co-operation is of great benefit to me and I hope that you will not turn me down ever. As soon as I get your consent, I will move this matter to the Cote D Ivoire Chamber of Commerce where the judicial commission for the transaction will be processed. Your prompt response and assurance that you will not turn down this deal will be of great help to me. Please, indicate your willingness by email or phone to me on extra2k39@myway.com Yours Faithfully Rev. Fr. David R.F. Kay.

4. Then comes the rose-tinted glasses of dawn, pouring over a messy scene that will last a lifetime. Your heart goes out to the families; your soul goes out to the defenseless person; and your wits go out for a foolhardy scheme. But who are you to judge? Look at this picture and decide for yourself. The picture above was taken in the company of a friend of mine. He was working at the time on a project and unfortunately, he was killed in the plane crash, leaving behind his wife and children behind. My friend was meeting with a financial commission for the final approval of the construction of the apartment he was going to build for me in Abuja-Grenada. After the meeting, my friend gave me the details of his deposit and told me that it was enough money to build 2 apartments in total. (The initial amount of $120,000.000.00 has been deducted from the total sum and is still with me now because my friend wants me to pay for the remaining balance. The total amount of money is still with me because my friend wants me to work out how to claim the money from the financial commission when I should be paid the balance in installments over the life time of the deposit. You decide what to do about it.

$20.00 USD only, We need $20,000USD to start the business and we are willing to offer you 20% of that amount if you can be a collaborator with us. The dirty secret about me is I am an alcoholic. I have been drinking all my life and I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just becoming rich. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul. So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do

For now, I  need a trusted foreigner who will help me carry out this task and also  look after the deposit I have made for the insurance company.

However, i will not  tell you anything that will jeopardize my life because  you told me to do business. I need  your  trust  and confidence because you have not done anything for me. I  want you to do this for me, please  do not be afraid, I  will not hurt you or your family. I just need  your trust and confidence. You will be rewarded  for your cooperation.

The 24 year old Moroccan citizen died in the plane crash of EgyptAir Flight MS804 January 31 2000, in the Sinai Peninsula. On January 30 2000, the Cairo-based Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority issued an emergency directive banning all domestic flights for the next three days and all international airports for the next four days. This ban was lifted shortly after, during the day, when the plane crashed into the Bercy mountains. The cause of the crash is still under investigation. Since his death, no one knows about his wealth, or where he deposited the money. We do not know if this fund will be remitted to any bank account or if it will be given out for investment. The ICAO has issued me an "emergency directive" to prepare a foreign account that will take care of this fund. However, I have decided to give you the chance to reclaim this funds since I don't have any foreign bank account to operate on.

(3) Make a formal application in my favor, and the approved bank will forward to the competent authorities to make the transfer. You will receive 10% for your effort. I will be very glad to reserve this privilege for you, if you prove yourself worthy to hold this fund. Thank you for your co-operation. Please, if you have any question or problem, feel free to contact me on this email address. My name is Prince George Mikel. I, am the son of late civil aviation official Jamal Mikel, who was killed in the plane crash of EgyptAir Flight MS804 January 31 2000, in Sinai peninsula. It is sad to say that all our civil aviation infrastructure was totally or nearly destroyed by the crash. But God knows the truth. I will be very glad if you will be kind enough to help me retrieve this fund from the bank. If I hear from you soon, I will reach you with the documents that will enable you get the funds.

====================
The Free Software Foundation has long been against many government programs that attempt to control the users of a particular program. Some government programs actively seek to limit or even eliminate certain types of software that they perceive as being in violation of their ideologies. One such program that is particularly objectionable to the FSF is that of the national Digital Currency Clearing House (NCCH). Programs such as this one, which restricts or even outright bans certain kinds of free software programs from running on certain types of machines, have historically been unpopular with the FSF. In its quest for control of the free software software market, the NCCH has implemented various policies and procedures to place certain kinds of software into restricted and/or blacklists. Programs that are well-known to be free software programs are usually included in such blacklists. In this case, the software was compiled and/or modified so that it is not compatible with the NCCH's system. If the software were allowed to run on the NCCH's machines, it would give rise to serious problems for the FSF and the software developers who wrote the programs. In order to avoid this situation, we as members of the GNU project must seek to enter into a joint venture or other appropriate arrangement with a suitable foreign corporation or individual that will work hand-in-hand with the NCCH to effect the transfer of certain kinds of software developed by the two parties into the other's accounts. The software developers will in turn use their special software skills to develop and deploy programs to allow the transfer of the funds into the other person's account.  This way, both parties will benefit from the funds as the funds will be divided 50 % to the FSF and 25 % to the NCCH's value added tax permit as compensation for all the work done by the software developers while 5% will be set aside to take care of all expenses that may be incurred in the course of carrying out this transaction.  The transaction is risk free since both parties have taken appropriate measures to minimise any chance of failure due to data leakage or any other reason.  Please, note that this transaction is only for the mutual benefit of both parties. It is highly recommended that you get back to us via mail as we cannot accept any form of email at this stage because of the nature of the transaction.  Please, if you are not interested in this transaction, we will accept any form of arrangement from you for the transfer of the funds into your account as soon as we will be able to transfer the funds into your account.  If you are interested, please indicate your interest by replying to this mail.   Thanks and God bless.  Andrew Phillips

The LIBERIA (Lorraine and Joseph Kabila) and THE EGYPT (General Sediq Sissi). The former is the former head of state of Sierra-leone. The latter is the former Finance Minister of the present Western-backed government of Siad Barre. General Sediq Sissi is the man who orchestrated the funding of the UN UNMOVIC peace keeping troops and later led them in a genocidal attack that claimed the lives of some of our Family &amp; friends. Before the death of General Sediq Sissi on December 4th, 2005, he had deposited with the Security Company in Abidjan, the sum of US$2.5 Million (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). The funds were originally gotten from over inflated contract price for the UNMOVIC peace keeping troops in the 1990s. The company has since been paid; and the funds were released to his family for safe keeping. Our relationship with the Security Company has been perfect at the time of deposit and transfer. I have contacted the Security Company to seek their consent to bring the funds out of the family safe haven and bring them into their custody here in Abidjan. If you are benevolent and sincere in your search for a reliable person or company to handle this transaction with you, I would like to go into partnership with you. If you are not, I will use my position in the air traffic control to get the funds out of the country. Even if it means giving you the capital to support your fraudulent scheme. I have put into effect legal documents that will enable us bring the funds out of the family safe haven and into your custody. Please send me your private telephone/fax numbers to enable us talk smooth &amp; I will be waiting for your response by fax or email. May God bless you as you assist us. Yours Faithfully, Mr. Blaise Ben Aissa

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now, I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars ($10,000.000.00) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time and hope to meet you somewhere. Reply me at your earliest convenience for further instructions. God be with you. Mr.Deshay Mswati

I'm a homosexual and I was married to a Turkish, but having been widowed once I had to remarry. I had no child until now due to my infertility, I decided to remarry my husband due to his procreation.Unfortunately my late husband died in a plane crash landing in Turkey in November 2000, but before his death he called on me and told me he has the sum of USD$9.5 Million and I am just the beneficiary of his will. He later told me that he deposited the money in a financial company in Europe. He also told me that he intends on using the money to purchase a shipping company and to also settle down with me in a few years because of the fact that his prognosis isn't good.  I too want to invest the money into a profitable business in your country, but I don't know if there is any such business that deals on raw materials for real estate or investment as I am not well versed on account opening and paying for. Inland we have our homes and I am the only living relative, I don't want my husband's efforts to be used for nothing in Europe. As soon as I receive your reply I will bring to you the financial company details and the desired action to be taken by financial companies when this money gets into their account. Until my late husband's death I was his only relation, I don't want anything to do with him now that he has died. I don't want his sister or his younger brother to know about this money because I want them to concentrate on their own families and I don't want them to know about my husband's efforts and everything I went through before he died. I don't want them to know about this money because now my husband has died and I don't want them to know anything about my taking part in this money.I don't want them to know about my involvement with my late husband because they will think that everything I did was just a ruse to lure my husband away from his money. As soon as I receive your reply I will also bring to you the details of the financial company and the requested action to be taken by financial companies when this money gets into their account and I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you to be the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to be honest with me and trust you to handle this transaction with honesty and transparency. I will be waiting to hearing from you soonest. Thank's in anticipation of your quick response. Yours Faithfully Rev. Fr. Michael O. Oputa

The Islamic Revolution in Iran was started by the revolutionary guards of the Shah. After the death of the Shah, the revolutionary guards led by Major Fadi Akpundeh took over power in Iran and they imposed a heavy censorship on the information that is available to the public. However, they were unable to control the information that is circulated in the country and that is why I am contacting you to seek your co-operation in conveying to you sensitive but personal information about important judgmental decisions and transactions which I am afraid will be of interest to you.   I need your cooperation to secure the release and transfer of some funds from a bank here in Iran to your account. The amount of money is $15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U. S Dollars). I will be willing to pay you 10% for your assistance to me or if possible any percentage would be discussed.   You must also maintain topmost secrecy as the funds are awaiting my authority to transfer.   If you find value in assisting me, kindly indicate your interest by replying to my private mail box for easier communication. I will be glad to offer you a reasonable percentage for your assistance, you must however, advise me of the final closing of the transaction.Your private email address: (for security reason) hosain@irishmail.com   Also, do not fail to furnish me with your private number for easy communication. I will be monitoring the whole situation here until I hear from you. thanks. Yours sincerely, H.O.I.R.Dada El Hadji Rabah.

Your choice of account will be our partnership amount, and you will be given 30% of the total sum after the funds are transferred to your account. I will herewith give you an idea of the type of account I am talking about. I will be glad to give you more details if you so desire. Also be assured that this transaction is 100% risk free.

This is an attempt to introduce a new phase in our relationship with you. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. I was raised in a devout Christian family, we were both killed by General Francisco Franco's Republican Guard during the civil war in Spain.My father was a member of the Democratic Unionist Party (P.U.D) and a proponent of peace in Northern Ireland. During the war in Northern Ireland, my father was one of the few rich farmers murdered by the Loyalists.  My father was among the few farmers killed by the rebels. As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my brother's beheading, I decided to run to England , to escape the fury of the British, who are against any religious/political union between the two nations. As a result of my brother's beheading, and with the news of my brother's beheading, I and my son Will had no other choice than to run to England to escape the fury of the British.  Before my brother's beheading, I asked God to forgive me, and I discovered a hidden compartment in a small box in a Warehouse here in London. I will appreciate if you help me and take me to your land, if you wish to help my brother with a trust worthy project, please reply back to me so that we can discuss more on this soon. Please, do not fail to contact me immediately if you are able and willing to help my brother.  God be with you.  Mrs. Fatimatou Kaba

You will be paid a percentage for each transaction as a commission for you assisting me to secure a suitable business partner abroad. The web was full of offers but I had to settle on your firm for this business because it can be done.

If you are not, kindly let me know and I will let you know the steps we will take to make sure that this transaction is 100% successful.

====================
The house was built in the Eighties with the help of the Chinese. The leader of the rebels, with the assistance of American and British soldiers, is making inroads into the rebel held cities of Douma and Darfur on the Nile Delta. As a result of this development, my wife and I decided to leave the country for safety. We came to Dakar senegal where we stay in a private home which is located on the 8th floor of a building. The owner of this building was Mr. Chiweng, a Chinese national, but unfortunately he was killed along side with my wife on one of their attacks. This made us to move to abidjan to be closer to our families. But unfortunately, we were all killed. All we left behind was his money and the home. We are left with the problem of trying to claim our belongings back from the bank. Mr. Chiweng is a very good man, after his death I decided to contact you because I want you to do the right thing and help me to transfer the money into your account. You will be helping to transfer the money over to your account. I will offer you 15% of the total amount for your kind help on this transaction. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. Please get back to me urgently so we can discuss further details. I await your quick response by forwarding to us your full name and contact details. Yours Faithfully, My Dear, I am Mrs. Jocelyn Jones. I am married to Mr. David Jones who worked with the National Nigeria Stock Exchange in Lagos, Nigeria for twenty years before he died in the year 2004.We were married for eleven years without a child. He was a very devoted Christian who worked with the Nigeria Stock Exchange from 1987-1990. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a bank in Nigeria. Presently, this money is still with the bank. Recently, my doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or better to be an orphan of the fund. I want you to help me in making the Claim and Trust in GOD that WE CANNOT GO BACK TO SPAIN WITHOUT HIS HELP. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I took this decision because I DON'T want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall   t hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Nigeria. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on this e-mail address (jocelyn_jones001@yahoo.co.uk) and I shall give you all information regarding the bank in Nigeria and my telephone number. You should reach me on this e-mail address as soon as you received this mail. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. May the angel of God bless you and may the lord bless you. You can contact me on my private telephone number +234 80 507 441 or on my confidential e-mail address (jocelyn_jones001@yahoo.co.uk) for more information. Best Regards, Jocelyn Jones. Hoping to hear from you. If you are still interested in serving the Lord, then please ask your Father to assist you in receiving the gift of the Lord.Father, Mr.Gilbert van Hefthofen.

The Russian government has approved the transfer of $1.35m (ten million three hundred thousand dollars) to an account in a bank in Europe, it said on its official website. The fund was originally gotten from over inflated contract value for the Moscow Olympics bid which the contractor (Chess Factory No.11) had executed in good faith and the contract had been executed. But the Chess Factory No.11 executed the contract in bad faith and the contract had been executed to the tune of US$5.2M, the over inflated contract value had been paid to a foreign contractor. The contract had been executed and Chess Factory No.11 had taken about 50% of the total sum, while the remaining Government Ministry would go for the balance of US$1.35M. The cheque was deposited at the Bank of England and the balance of US$1.35M was being held in escrow by my lawyer here in London. My lawyer is a top London based lawyer so I will be very very glad if you can assist us in clearing this fund into your account for onward transfer to your account. This is a very easy process, all we need is for you to be honest and sincere enough to help us, and then I will then tell the Bank where the funds are and they will let us out of the cusps. We will use your services to clear the fund into your bank account. At the conclusion of this business,we shall help to invest the funds in commercial properties in your country or anywhere else you indicate, and we shall continue to serve you on that you will be honest enough to help us. Please, I urge you to be honest to me, so that the funds will be beneficial to us.. Please, Please, I beg you to look after my situation, I have been a victim of extortion and blackmail, I have been threatened with both State and Federal Government and non-State Government reprisals should I not cooperate with you to facilitate this transaction. I beg you to please help me, because I will not stand trial but my life is in danger. I said I will use your help to invest the fund in your country. I will pay you 5% of the total sum for your assistance and management. I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter, as I am afraid of reprisal against non-cooperation parties. Please, I will like you to be honest enough to say that you will be on my side should I need your assistance in this transaction. Thanking you, I await your response soonest.

But alas, my developing illness has compelled me to give this benediction to GOD, for he has blessed me so that I should not waste away. I am Jaziri Amir, wife to Amir Jaziri, who was the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of the sovereign wealth fund company of Kuwait. He was killed along side with his wife in the plane crash involving Concorde 2131 in the year 2000.The fund company was founded in 1999 and was dissolved into two pieces two years ago leaving behind the deposit of $18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million dollars) in my care. I am saddled with the problem of securing the funds from the depositor and securing the documents that will back up my claim. Financial world is full of surprises and twists and turns; I have lived my life so well. I have enjoyed every moment of it. But now I know not everything will be the same after death. I have been thinking of ways and means of securing the funds while leaving behind for my future and that of my family. I have decided to give an account of the funds to a bank and let the funds roll in there. I want this to be a long term arrangement, because I want this money to be transferred to a banking and investment  company where my funds will be safe and secure. I have decided to do this from now on out; until I am nessusied, I will not be able to do this myself because of my health situation. I want the total amount to be in the bank at the end of the day, because every cent counts when it comes to securing the funds and transferring it to the banking and investment company for investment. Please, I will like you to assist me in this transaction. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable me see this deal through. Your earliest response to this e-mail is to indicate your interest to work with me to finalize this transaction. I will not be overly nervous if this letter reaches you as a mutual trust, since I know my time will soon be up. I will give you all the information I need to secure the funds and transfer it to the new bank. After which you can contact the bank for their direct deposit to me. Finally, you will be given the opportunity to negotiate the modalities for the finalization of the transaction. I will be perfectly willing to listen to any solution that will avert this nightmare scenario. May God be with you. Yours truly, Jaziri Amir

====================
The following contact information is for collection and will be of no use to you unless and until we are together as a family :  Mrs. Susan Thompson (email+1-806-696-9847). My name is Susan Thompson, I am an Iraqi refugee, I am presently in Lebanon and I have been since I was a child. I am married to Dr. Fadi Thompson who worked with the Lebanese National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in Haririyeh in south Lebanon for nine years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for eleven years without a child, he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $2.2M (Two Million Two Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) with a private holding company in Belgium. Presently, this money is still with the company in Belgium. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to NNPC rather than take it from them. Now I am in a private clinic here in Abidjan, I have been told that I have only a few days to live. I have been thinking about this for a long time and I feel that I am very much in need of support and I feel that I am in a good position to remarry and get a child outside my matrimonial home. I want a Christian or a Muslim to take this and help me to raise a Christian or a Muslim child in this country so that the government of Lebanon will not take away my money from me. I will be willing to take any Muslim or Christian boy or girl of good family to help me to raise this Christian or a Muslim child in this country. The matrimonial home of my late husband was destroyed by the rebels during the war but fortunately they managed to get me and my son out of the hospital and we are now somewhere in Syria where we will remain until we are able to secure our money with a good bank here in Syria. I am now in a private clinic and I need your maximum cooperation from you to enable me successfully complete this operation and bring my money to you. I will give you 25% of the total amount at the end of this business. I will like to know if you can also help me to invest this money in your country and into any good business that you advise me on for we are in a bad position because of the war here in Lebanon and the fact that I need a Christian or Muslim boy or girl to take me as a daughter and to help me start a Christian or a Muslim business here in this country because this money is now with a very good bank. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance to me and to my son. I will be very happy to hear from you. Thank you very much. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another Christian or Muslim for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act just as I have stated herein. I will like you to contact my son Fadi via email: fadi_at1234@myway.com Yours faithfully, Fadi Ata

sold by her Majesty to you in- swerd for $9,500.000.00 USD and now she wants us to defer the payment of $9,500.000.00 USD to her bank account while explaining to you that we have $9,500.000.00 USD stashed somewhere out- side Africa. This is the reason why we are saddled with taking this bold step. I got your contact in cause of a seri- ous search for an agent abroad who can assist us in dealing with the bank and clearing the money out from their account while we will transfer it to your account pending the method of our sharing. Meanwhile we will use our share to invest in your country or elsewhere as soon as you indicate your interest in assisting us. I will be glad to reserve my right to instruct the bank to release the money to you immediately since it seems to me like an unjustified debt; however I require your full co-operation to enable us see this deal through.

The MoU was concluded in July 2003 and was executed in July 2005 during the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The construction began in August 2005 and the final closing touches were carried out in July 2006. DLF Developments BPJ3 has been assured a 70% share in the fund estimated to be over US$10 billion.

In August 2005, the former Nigerian President (OBE) was forced to resign after more than three years, stating that he was poisoned by the Christian Fundamentalists who opposed his plans. President Obasanjo, however, had left US$10.4B (Ten Million Dollars Five Hundred Thousand) to be paid to the Christian Fundamentalists, which he would like the funds to be transferred into the accounts of foreign contractors. As a result, most of the fund will be released to you as the contractor for the World Cup Stadium and associated facilities, while 5% will be for me and my colleagues, while the remaining 70% will be for the Nigeria Army. As soon as I receive your response I shall give you the contact information of the contractors who are in possession of the funds, and we will then go to the World Cup Stadium Construction where we will secure the necessary licenses and finalize contracts.

I have been dealing in Diamond there for the past 6 years and I am now moving to other businesses as it gets more difficult for me to stay one step ahead of the new developments in my country. It is a sad day when a business you so devoted your life to can't continue because the new regime in power just came into power and the old regime is in ruins. Some of my customers have already given me life threatening advice to move out of my country because of the looming danger, while some have offered me money and my only hope now is in my ability to get a few of them out of my country before they too get wiped out by the forces of the new regime. In any case, I need your immediate assistance in getting this fund out of Dubai on the credit of you and  you will be given 5% for helping me. I have notified my credit bureaus about my new location, and am awaiting their response.

Barry, a well known and reputable business man, has been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Dollar that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside only 20% for you and for your time. God be with you. Barry D. Nesedinro.

LIVINGSTON - I am Rula Binh the wife of late Dr.Solomon Solow who lived in the capital of Saigon when he was in the hospital here in Dakar, Sierra-leone. I am writing you this letter based on the data collected from the medical database during my husband's last stay here in Dakar before he was mysteriously killed by unknown assailants. The deceased was a very prosperous businessman and I was his first wife. He acquired a lot of properties in the land down in the valley here in Sierria-Leone. I will like you to help me in acquiring these properties from the Malaysian firm and I will also invest this money in your country on furthering my education and assuming charge of the properties when I get back to my country. In your response I will like to know if you can help me put claim on these properties from the Malaysian firm and I will also like to know if you can put up any capital to invest on this property in your country as I do not have any idea how I will be able to manage this myself since I have not gone through any business plan. Sending you this brief information will give me room in sourcing for a good foreign partner to take this transaction public or private, private or foreign. Further information will be given to you as soon as you indicate your interest in assisting us. Please, I implore you to keep this confidential for the interest of my children and I am the only one who knows of this transaction in this regards. As soon as I receive your reply, I will then give you full details on how I will be able to get my hands on these properties from the Malaysian firm and I will also give you all the information I will need to get over to your country and start construction on my own. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original benefactor of this property. I will like to know your opinion on this transaction before handing it over to you, please, I will prefer you contact me via email for more details. Please, I will like you to confirm this transaction if you will like me to give you more dates to submit applications for the properties to the Malaysian firm. Please, I implore you if you are able to assist me to do this transaction, you should reach me immediately for discussion and giving me more details of the deposits and methods to deposit the properties.

In those days, David was a very prosperous farmer in SOUTH AFRICA. But he was victimized by greed and injustice, and was driven into poverty and despair by the continuing presence of two former friends,( Mr. Eugene  Oliphant and Mr. Paul Kruk ) He died  on January 17th,2007 after a brief illness at the tender age of 77 years. The fund  (US$8.3M) was accumulated  from my father's old-aged purchases  over-invoiced and completed his new-build  house in 2009 without  the knowledge of his son. Now my mother and I are saddled with the problem of securing the  funds for our settlement in  southern Africa. Our problem now is to transfer these funds into a safe  account in south africa with foreign partner who can facilitate the  transfer and finalizit our claim of the funds and into his/her  bank account pending for us.

In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, I have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. Recently, my doctor told me that I had aterminating illness, which would last for the next three months, if I don't get better. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate part of my wealth to either a charity organization or devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a Christian organization or individual that will use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms,charity organizers emphasized on participation and I believe that this holy bible is being faithfully executed here in Nigeria. I took this decision because I don't have any child to start from and my husband's relatives are all dead and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I have been thinking about this question ever since I realized that I don't have any child that will inherit this money and I will not be able to care for my husband's relatives if I don't start from scratch. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall  hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the finance and security company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian life. Whoever that Wants to serve the Almighty must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a Christian organization or a devoted Christian for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams  will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the almighty lord continue to guide and protect you. Reply me with this mail box:seymour@heryati.com Thanks and God bless, Yours sincerely, Mr. Sery Ali.

The Marine Le Pen is currently in Spain, where she is expected to address the pro-democracy march "Marseillaise" on Friday,23rd April. Going by her interviews with Spanish and other international news agencies, she is expected to say that she will not accept any money from the Spanish government, as the deal for the transfer of the funds over to her country is currently done. In order to avoid this, we need a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiary of these funds and help us get them out of Spain for our safety. I am the only beneficiary of the funds in this message, as I have always kept them in a trunk box in my safe in Abidjan Cote d Ivoire. The funds are used in buying agricultural machinery and chemicals for export. The government of Spain de facto confiscated my bank deposit and is now prepared to declare the bank unserviceable if I do not remit the funds through a third party. In order to prevent this, I need your help and assistance to stand as the beneficiary of the funds and help to set up a valid company in Spain to deal with my funds. The company shall be set up in collaboration with you and other well-wishers who shall be of great assistance to me. As I cannot move any payment myself due to my health situation, you shall be my manager and I shall be the director. The money I have left in your custody is the amount of money which I will remit to you when I am better able to do so, if you can stand as the beneficiary of the funds. Keep this communication tight. I expect to hear from you if I am able to reach you. Please, I implore you to treat this matter as very urgent. Yours Faithfully, MR. MURRAY FELIX

The removal and disposal of the body parts from the site has been going on since 2003 but the last report of the body parts was in 2011 and since then no one has come forward to claim the body parts as they were declared unserviceable by the bank where these parts originated. Now, the bank have come around and declared the parts serviceable again. The dismembered parts are now in a mechanical storage facility awaiting shipment. There is a possibility of shipment before the bank comes out with their final verdict. I contacted you because I am interested in investing in your country or any other. I am not able to claim the parts as my part of inheritance as it will be against the law for me to claim such huge sum of money for my work done in Nigeria. I will like you to be honest enough to approach me and I will listen to your story. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact of the bank. I will do everything in my power to make sure that you are able to claim the parts at auction as the wholesaler of the parts. Thank you very much. You should also get back to me with your private mail boxes. No amount of money can buy you happiness again as soon as you realize what you have got. Wait till I hear from you. Yours faithfully, Mr. P. K. Kaba.

The Cascadia Subdivision is a geographic region of land lying between the Canadian and U.S borders in Washington State, USA. The region was once part of the west Coast Woodland, but has since been heavily impacted by logging and development. The region has produced just 0.3% of the total U.S. land area, but accounts for 15% of the United States Gross Domestic Product. I am a historian by profession and I have been studying the region for years to locate any buried treasure. I have located several tombs in the region, however, most of them date back to the late 18th century. There are also reports of ancient grottoes, buried under the ground, and ancient springs. I have discovered abandoned villages and towns, abandoned cemeteries, as well as abandoned mines and ruined cemeteries throughout the Cascadia Subdivision. All this has led me to believe that whoever buried the fund must be somewhere in the region. I have therefore been searching the Cascadia Subdivision since I was an undergraduate for any buried treasure that can be pried loose from the cemeteries and be put to good use.

DEAR SIR, I am Mr. Vernon Willm from the republic of Sierra Leone in Africa. I am married to Mrs.Lydia Willm, who worked with Sierra Leone Embassy in Ghana for nine years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $1.6 Million with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Recently, my DOCTOR told me that I would not last for the next born unless I donate this money into a Christian organization. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund into an appropriate Christian organization for the work of God. I want an organization that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to nderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall

According to medical sources, Abbas died from his wounds but his son Mohammad has declared himself the winner of the battle because he is currently the one who is holding the Israeli soldiers at bay so that they will not raid the neighborhood. The Israeli army has also started clearing the neighborhood and has already done away with most of the houses in the neighborhood so that only Mohammad Abbas is left with his parents and Sister Karen and he is currently being held in the Al-Aksaiba Bank in Bethlehem. According to medical sources, the attack will be intensified after the death of Mahmoud Abbas on June 17th when he will take over from his brother as the next of kin to the late President of the Palestinian National Authority. On this note, I am writing you to solicit your assistance in the followings ways. 1. To help me secure my release from the Al-Aksaiba Bank 2. To transfer this money (US$15 million) three times over to your country and make sure that you will not forget my mom and me because we are not allowed to leave the country until after the transfer because the money is the only thing currently in my possession. Please, this is a tightrope walk due to the fact that my mom and me are still in touch with the Israeli Embassy in my country so we have no fear of anyone as long as we remain on the tightrope. All I need from you is to note my legal domiciliary address and my personal must not be disclosed to you pending your response as I want you to always be on the lookout for persons who have knowledge of this confidential information so that you should always be on the look out for any and all scam attempts from here on out. The reason for taking this bold step is that with the imminent change of government in Israel, there will be major changes to transport and banking laws in Israel and I am sure that I can trust you to not betray my trust by giving me away for nothing in this regard. It is only an opportunist that will not work this out for the sake of it because I will not let him down once I get my money. Once my money is transferred into your possession, we shall both go to the embassy and both of us will sign an agreement that nobody will ever know about my money until we have both been dead for three years. I want you and the bank to always be prayer for me because God has chosen me to be his chosen one. As soon as I get your consent, I will promptly start planning the deposit and the amount to be invested on your behalf. You can be my investment liaison to the bank because I will be coming over to assist the bank as soon as I receive your consent to invest my money on your behalf. I will be under the impression that there is a very good chance of success since I am the only one who knows of the movement of the funds and the security of the funds. However, if you are not ok with this idea please treat like any other scumbag that want to do this type of business with me. I will not mind losing this business to you if it means we can do this together. I got your contact from a directory that speaks good of you. My phone calls and faxes have been going on for the past 2 days and I hope to hear from you by email. I have decided to pay you a fixed percentage of the total sum if we can do this business together. (I will give you further details when I get your consent to let you know more about this money). You will be rewarded at the end of this project with 25% of the fund for all you did for me and the balance of 5% will be for expenses that will be incurred in the process of arranging the payment. Please always be prayer for me and always be alert for scammers and other rip-off artists alike. If you are to know where to go for more details please feel free to reach me on phone number +972-370-2907(J) or email. Yours Faithfully Revd. Fr. Mario Resto.

U.S. Pat. &amp; Application; US$7,500,000.00 (Seven million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars) Has been in my possession since I lost my husband and is presently in a private safe keeping company in Europe for safekeeping. Due to the political instability in my country, my Doctor told me that I would not last for a long time and that I should have a child soon. According to my docs, the day I lose my husband, I will be either carried out of the company or  I will be committed to a psychiatric hospital. My Doctor told me that I had the potential to give birth to a child within the next four months. He advised me that I should use this opportunity to invest this fund and create a new life for my children for I have been searching for a Godly, wealthy, committed person who will use this money to enable me send my children to university and also start a new life for my children as I do not have any one to support me. Please, do not tell anybody about this until I call you on my phone number 234-682-6756 or email at k_yuja_devi@yahoo.co.uk God be with you. Please, reply me when you have replied me.

The above information and pictures constitute historical fact and are not truthful. While researching for some investment project in Europe I came across your email address and decided to contact you for a possible investment transaction. I will be very glad to make this possible to you if you can be of an assistance to me. I will like to invest your part-time/working capital in an area of high potential for growth for my mutual benefit. In Asia-Pacific region, Asia-Europe and America-West, the U.S.A. is the largest producer and exporter of oil and natural gas, and second largest supplier to Canada and Alaska. I was a member of the Middle East Economic Cooperation Cooperation (MEEC) administering the national contract award and monitoring committee during my tenure. We were mandated to recommend contracts for payment by the designated Contract Payment Commission. In the course of our work on approving the largest contracts in the national contract award and monitoring Committee, we discovered huge sum of money that will be transferred to the benefit of the Lebanese and Iranian firms with the sum of US$4.5 Million. This deal was struck in good faith, and it should be valued at over US$4 Million per annum. In doing this deal, we acquired a lot of classified information regarding the source and amount of the contract value and the contracting procedure which is why we are indebted to have it under our control. We are looking for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business transaction to help us transfer the US$ 4.5M. This amount will be shared between us as follows: 1) 30% for you as compensation for your services. 2) 5% for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction. 3) 40% will be for us. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen working days of commencement after receipt of the following information: your full name, full address, your private telephone and fax numbers. I will communicate with you should you indicate your interest and desire to assist us in this deal. I intend to use my position and influence to effect the smooth conclusion of this deal if I receive positive responses to this letter. If you are not interested, kindly express your desire to others to avoid the impression that you are not serious about this business. I will vigorously promote my position and obtain necessary permissions from any governing body to proceed fully with this deal. Kindly indicate your interest by replying to this mail and I will await your prompt response. Thanks and God bless. Yours Faithfully, Mr. MAFIZ.

DETROIT—As U.S. crude oil stockpiles rise above previously reported levels, and as some traders are selling at discount, the leading oil producing states in the U.S.A. are bumping into one another in an energy war. This has driven up the average cost of oil produced in North America from about $40 per barrel to about $90 per barrel, according to industry research firm, Baker Hughes. This has led some producers to abandon their contracts and others to cut their workers' hours.  Some producers, such as Saudi Arabia, are using their purchasing power to grab market share from other producers and send a message to the rest of the oil producing world that they can afford to pay their workers more money.  Before the slump in oil prices of recent years, oil producing states in the U.S.A. were able to afford to pay their workers as little as $8.50 an hour, but these numbers have soared since the price of oil have been over $100 per barrel, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in Washington D.C. The EPI researchers estimate that OPEC producers in the U.S.A. earned just over $17.5 Million per day in 2010, compared with about $15.5 Million per day for non-OPEC producers.  This has meant that some producers have cut back on their production and sent their workers home, while others have expanded their output.  According to research by the EPI, some producers paid their employees a 13-hour day and some a 15-hour day, while others mandated overtime.  According to EPI, some producers cut back on overtime and some even eliminated benefits for their workers.  Some producers have been especially hard hit, not just by the slump in oil prices but also by the increasing cost of basic commodities such as food and medicine.  A recent study by the EPI estimated that OPEC producers in the U.S.A. enjoyed a 17.5% share of the $55.4M Dollar.  The EPI study also found that some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  Some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.  According to the EPI, some producers have stopped paying their suppliers and some even redirected some of their output to avoid paying their suppliers.

Yes. It is indeed possible to have children after all the above mentioned start. It was only a matter of time before we got to this plane ride from Bangkok to Cotonou. More importantly, who knows how long we will stay here before someone comes along and takes us away? I personally am not afraid of death since I am a very pious person. I think everyone should die someday. Why I write to you now is that I do not want my generation to suffer like this. My mother died when I was only 6 years old and my father when I was 19 years old, she was a very wealthy widow that lived in the royal house of my country Serie-One. I personally want you to help me to get to my Father and save my life. But I have to solicit your assistance in this matter because I do not have any knowledge of business or investment until I finish up my education. I need to get a trust worthy person to help me as a trust worthy person should not only support and assist me in my business but also in my investment as well. Please consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated. If you are not interested, kindly keep this transaction under wraps until we find a trust worthy person who will help us to do this business and invest this money. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated. Thanks,  Mr. Kuching Tse.

Dawson, Duke of York. I have always admired your great ability and my belief that you will be a successful and dedicated business-owner, and I am happy to say that you really are! I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in transacting this transaction with you. Your ability to deal with individuals and businesses of the world's largest and most important economy, is second to none. I have decided to invest 25% of this fund in your country, based on trust and confidence, as indicated by the fact that you have never dealt with a single individual or a business as the true owners and operators of this fund. Moreover, we have agreed to share the money 50-50, so that we end up with 25% for you, and 10% for taxation and management fees. I have discussed with my colleagues in the ministries of finance and economy and we have all agreed that the remaining 5% will be for taxation and management fees. I will in turn give you the percentages, as indicated below, so as to enable us work out the modalities for a smooth conclusion of the transaction. Once again, please do not panic because this could be one of the most lucrative business in my country. I cannot overstate my gratitude to you, I have come to accept you as good neighbors and I believe you will treat this transaction with sincerity and fairness. Please contact me immediately through my private email address, dr_deng_don@yahoo.co.uk Yours faithfully, DR. DENG DON

In case you don't know already, I am Joe Hill the son of Dr. George Hill, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer, which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so I will not have to think about money, I will just give out my money to charity organizations, and use my own money to arm and train black farmers in South Africa and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.

The Iranian anti-American forces that are loyal to Saddam Hussein shot and killed my brother and I were returning from a shopping trip in Baghdad during the summer of 2005. My brother was one of the Military leaders of the rebellion that overthrew Saddam Hussein.  According to the Iraqi military, they were prepared to kill me and my brother because of our relationship with my brother. Since then I have been hiding in a refugee camp in the Baghdad, 4th of July Prime Minister, we are not able to visit our families as we are under the protection of the Iraqi army and the Kurdish Peshmerga forces. During the summer of 2005 I was among the few thousand Sunnis who took refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq under the leadership of the Democratic Union Party (P.U.D) party led by Masoud Barzani. During the fighting in and around the Peshmerga Forces Base, I was hit by an IED. Fortunately I survived the attack and have been living in exile. However, due to the presence of the US soldiers protecting my location, I do not want the soldiers to know about my location as I am very afraid of them. I have decided to give you the contact of the Army and the Federal Ministry of Defense so that you can get in touch with the Army and get me out of here. Please keep this information confidential because I am afraid of the situation here. Meanwhile, I will like you to tell the Army and the Federal Ministry of Defense that you are with me, that I am in a hotel and will be coming over to meet with them. You must not tell anyone about this until the end of this undertaking. am waiting to hear from you soon. Yours Faithfully, Fadi Al-Asad Al-Husayni.

The year is 2000 and my Father has been ill for a very long time now. I am the only daughter he had.  He died of a long time ago but after he was in the hospital he called me and told me he has the sum of Ten million two hundred thousand united states dollars (US$10.2M).He advised me not to tell anyone about this, he said I shall not last long. That I will not be able to go back to school because I have suffered so much. I am now 17 years of age and a high school senior. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. I have been told I have only a few months to live. I have not particularly lived my life so well; I was never a very kind person. But now I know I have no future. My father, my mother, my brothers and I all want me dead. My late father, my late mother, my brothers and I all want me dead. My life was so short, but I was not able to fathom that God be merciful to me. I am now a refugee in Spain . I am so sorry that I got to post this to you now. I will want you to always be praying for me. I will be looking for someone who will take me as a son and also help me. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay will be painful on my end, while trying to get this fund transferred over here will make me very anxious. I will also like to switch my last will and testament to God for the goodment of my soul. Thanks and God bless you. My sincere love, ALEX CHAKOWITZ.

After a brief time in prison, I was released on bail and now back on the run after the Government of Nigeria closed in on me as the next of kin of the funds, they claimed that I have no other choice than to seek for refuge in the country of my origin in West African nation Nigeria. Nigeria is an oil rich nation and with the political instability in Nigeria, our wealth and income have been steadily declining. One of the reasons why I am back on the run is to escape the clutches of the Nigerian Government who are after my freedom. Fearing that my freedom would be restricted or even lost in this new political dispensation, I have decided to reinvestced my money and if possible transfer my money abroad. A good friend of mine advised that I should invest the sum of eight million dollars here in Nigeria. The friend advised that I should also invest some amount of money in property management/real estate business in Europe as well as into mutual fund and other profitable ventures. After careful consideration, I have decided to transfer this fund into his account pending my liberation and I will contact you when this is done. I have decided to give you this assistance because there is no prospect of my freedom as all efforts to free me have been made by the Government and it is very difficult for any one of us to escape from here. More so, the current political instability here in Nigeria has made it very difficult for any one of us to get a home or even start a business of our own. Also, my lawyer charges might be a tad high. But pay attention, I want you to get this funds from the Nigerian Embassy here in Lagos into your account. And when this is done, I will come over to Nigeria and Manage this funds for me until I am released from prison. Then you will help me transfer this fund abroad in your name. Meanwhile, on completing this, you will help me finish the business with my own share. Lastly, you will help me secure security for my future and that of my children. Please, I have asked you to refrain from intervening in this matter and I hope you will not push too hard for what I want from you. I await your reply soonest. Thanks and God Bless. Yours sincerely Mr. George. Khan -

The second week of December, 2004, I was woken from a deep slumber by the terrible news of a car accident along Moskva-Abayomi Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Before my time, I had prayed over it and decided to travel to the crash site to find out where the body of the deceased was buried. I made a stopover in Accra Ghana, then on the 2nd of January, 2005, I reached Accra Ghana and discovered the remains of the deceased in a rented apartment. The landlord of the apartment told me that the deceased had no children and that he had stopped paying his deposit when he died. I decided to contact you to seek your assistance in transfering this amount of money into your account for me to invest and also for a mutual business relationship. I have agreed with my colleague probate attorney Hossain that 30% of this funds will be for you while 10% will be for expenses and the remaining 70% will be for me. Please I will want you to help me as much as you can in relocating and securing the next-of-kin permissions to come over to my side until I can transfer the money into your account. Please if I reach you confident that you will not betray my trust, I will want you to send me a picture of your well wishes as soon as I get your response to this mail. I will be waiting for your response as soon as possible. Thanks and may God bless you. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Maryam Abacha.

SARA SCHUBACH'S NEW DELHI 0000-010-9268-311 Tel:011-620-7147-857-530. EMAIL:arachnis@myway.com Dear Friend, I am Mr. Arachnis Aranyan ,a director in charge of investment projects in the new Industrial City in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). My office monitors and controls the affairs of all natural gas companies involved in the Gulf of Aden gas pipeline project and the Sudan-Saudi Arabian gas pipeline project, and several others. (1) Where the max contract value was agreed for the pipeline project. (2) Where the project has been finalised and commission for the initial engineering works has been agreed. We have therefore agreed to reimburse the natural gas companies for all the expenses and taxes that might be incurred in the event of completion from the date of receipt of the fund into our care. (3) Amount which has been agreed by the contractors at the commencement of the project. We now wish you to indicate your interest to  assist us in clearing the funds from the natural gas companies and transferring it into your care. The entire process of this transfer will take only a few days to be executed both in person at the natural gas company and in a similar capacity checking all the accoutrements on behalf of the bank. We are using your name as our representative in the natural gas companies concerned because you are from the same country. Please do not be afraid to show your interest and willingness to work with us. We will look after your interest and convenience. Your service is non-refundable. In fact, I just received your details from my secretary who indicated you as the next of kin. There is no doubt that you will be of great assistance to me and my desk will be very much helped if you avail yourself of my services. Can I really trust you to handle this deal with integrity and honesty? Please I implore you to give me the confidence and assistance I require in this transaction. God bless you and permit you success and whatsoever else you desire as I endeavor to see this deal through. I will be very glad if you can render your service to me. You can contact me with your positive response to this business proposal through my e-mail address at this private telephone number:011-620-7147-857-530. You will be giving this business 500 Million Deutsch Marks (Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) which will be good for you. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the situation in the Middle East and the cited above. Sadly, bad news from the Middle East has at first been to my mind very important. As you can understand, I am really anxious that my plan will be executed as I fear that my family will be targeted since they are the ones being targeted the most. However, I am afraid that they may be the ones targeted again as soon as I send out for the withdrawl and deposit of this fund. Now I need your perfect response to my problem. I shall be glad to give you 50% of the total sum if you can act quickly and 60% if you can continue the transaction with me and we shall both make out 10% for you. You can reach me on my number 01221-56721505 or by email at: Arachnis@myway.com. I await your response. Yours Truly, Mr. Arachnis Aranyan

I was at the dinner when Suddenly, my mother ran upstairs and I did not have my wits about me. I made my way down to the basement and found her husband. She was dead, I think she poisoned herself. I rushed down to the basement and found my husband. She was also dead. But I did not know it at the time, because I was afraid of what would happen to me if I talked about it. When I got down to the basement, I found her coffins stacked one on top of the other. I immediately went down to the basement and I started digging. When I came out, I found my husband and I KNEW HE HAD DIED FOREVER because he had no relation.I found out later that he had NOBODY in his family. My investigation into his background proved to be fruitless. I called the British Embassy and they told me that he had NOBODY in his family either. That he had only MEANWHILE DIED and LEAVE DONE MANY CONFIDENTIAL EMAILS TO HIS FAMILY. I HAVE NO ANSWER TO THIS LETTER BUT I AM WILLING TO WITHDRAW THIS INFORMATION INTO THE FAMILY FILE WHEN I AM AM SURE THAT MY RATIO OF ACCOUNT QUALITY IS OKAYROUND FOR THE SAHARA FACTOR.

The risks associated with treating HIV-positive patients with antiretroviral therapy have been well studied. Now, a team of researchers led by Dr. David Thew, MD, FRCPC, from the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Israel have developed a novel antiretroviral drug, which should be available in most european countries within a few months. The team developed the drug as a medicine to treat  HIV-positive patients undergoing radical  surgery and is currently in the investigational mode. It is currently undergoing clinical trials in Europe and as well as being used in Israel and some other hot spots in America and Asia. The drug is currently prescribed only to high-risk groups, which is why it is not approved for general use, but rather for the treatment of  patients exhibiting high-risk behaviors. Due to its low side-effect profile, research is presently being conducted on its potential for treating  HIV-positive patients. Dr. David Thew, MD, FRCPC, is the Director of research and development at Albert Einstein Medical Center and the author of the research paper which is currently in  scientific journal, is currently working on other research projects in the area of antiretroviral therapy. Although the company has put out some research paper describing the drug, they are not ready to go into  production. Instead, they are pursuing licensing and registration in the countries where the research is  being carried out. This has made it very difficult for  patients suffering from  severe depression, PTSD, ALS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,  Leber congenital and other  diseases, to get treatment, as they can not afford medicines. According to one patient, who preferred not to be named,  with  life they have spent over 1 million dollars on their medications and another who  preferred not to be named,  with the last of her  wealth she had gone through, she was hoping that the research would  be funded and completed by now, but all  efforts have been made by the researchers to reach a conclusion. She is lamenting the fact that it is taking so long for the drug to be  approved to the treatment of her. Fortunately, Dr. David Thew, MD has the cure for  HIV. With my nature as a Missionary I had to seek for a  particular person and organization who will assist me carry out this mission and  also carry out this transaction as I cannot disclose my identity or  location to them because of my status here. Their contact information is:  (1) syed.samuel.k.thew@albitra.com (2) albendrombe@yahoo.fr Please, I implore you to reply to my email on my private email address (david_thew@albendrombe.com) for easy communication and to remain blessed in  the face of  pain and suffering.I did not want  to disappoint you but rather I wanted to assist you. As soon as I receive your reply , I shall give you more  information regarding my plan to carry out this mission and also  discuss it with you. I will also issue you a letter of authority that  will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I  hope you will always remain steadfast in your mission and  always strive for the welfare of mankind. I remain with you in spirit and belief that you  will not let down the trust and confidence I am going to put in you. I  believe that you will always be with me because I  believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence I  am going to put in you. I am hoping that this transaction will be  successful and that you will not regret taking part in it. Please always be praying for me. Thank you and God bless. Yours sincerely, David Thew.

====================
That night, Mr. Al-Fayadh, my wife and I went out to the 'Aida Market' to buy some tea. We stopped at the tea shop and he bought a box of five tea cakes with a value of Twenty Three Million Three Hundred Thousand American dollars (US$3.3m) . I did not know that this box contained an important amount of money or that it was the, (US$3.3m) Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. I am here with my children (5,8 and 11) to receive the fund from the tea shop owner. As my husband and my family were leaving the tea shop, the owner shot and killed me and my children,because I and the children are Muslims. As a Muslim, I am very bothered and scared because I never knew who might kill me or my family. I left the country immediately we came here and now my two daughters are in another country awaiting their father's arrival. I want the US$3.3m to be transferred to your account as soon as you declare your interest in doing so,if you are not running away with it because I am afraid of the consequences. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the religion of Allah, I only need your assistance and support to ensure a smooth and safe operation. I have already assured the security company where the box is stored that the box will be moved to another security company for safe keeping for onward transfer.

First, let me introduce myself. I am Mr. C. Robert Moodey, an accountant in South Africa. I am the personal account officer of Mr.Habib Waheed, an Iraqi refugee, who used to work with the South African Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq.In 1991, Mr. Habib Waheed, his wife and their three Children were involved in a car accident along Israel Lake Road, Bushehr. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. I have contacted you because I have decided to search for a reliable foreign partner to help me secure a sufficient amount of funds to relocate to South Africa and invest in my lifetime. After going through your details, and after due due negotiations, we decided to fund a residential property together. Since the fatality rate in Iraq was 7.5%, I have decided to seek your personal approval to invest the sum of $15,500,000(FIFTEEN million) into your property.Here is my proof of deposit as well as details of the fund. All I require is your consent to move this fund out of my country and you are to be contacted in South Africa or your country for sharing the fund. I will be glad to inform you all along the manner of the transaction as soon as your reply indicates your willingness to co-operate fully with me. You are to tell me your confidential telephone numbers and email address and I will then issue you a letter of authorisation to  contact the bank for payment. I will give you all the information of the designated bank in my next letter. I want you and the investor close to me to know that I have been in contact with the designated bank for the withdrawal and sharing of the fund. I will be glad to inform you about the method of the payment but do not let me out to inform you about it. All I want from you is to help me transmit the funds into your account in South Africa. I will give you 25% of the total amount and 10% will be set aside for expenses that might be incurred in the process of this transaction. The money will be delivered to you in your name and then you will send the rest of the money to the designated bank for onward transfer to your account.  I will also issue you a letter of authorisation to the bank for onward transfer to my account. It will be my pleasure to hear from you.  Please, if you are willing to help me, give me your immediate reply so that I will forward required information to the bank for onward transfer. If you are not willing, I will be glad to let you know that I have all necessary legal documents that will be forwarded to you when you indicate your interest to assist me. Finally, remember to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality as it may depend on you how you respond to this proposal. Please, I wait anxiously to hear from you. Yours faithfully, Mr.ABACHA KHALEM

You may use the wadir to return the fund, you shall not use the wadir to  assist another person. I took this decision  because I don't have any other  option than to return the fund to the bank,   that is where it belongs.I also don't want to  use the wadir for investment  purposes because I don't want  to upset the balance in the bank. I took  this decision  because I don't have a good relation in the local

Pruitt Pritchett, a farmer in the heart of the Ogoni Agricultural Estate in the Sierra Leone-Republic of Sierra Leone, was the victim of a brush with death. He was attacked and killed by unknown assassins who came to claim his farm. The cause of death is still unknown. Before his death, he had made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. He has encouraged and ministered to the poor and the sick. He was a very dedicated Christian and a great philanthropist.  His last wish was that his friends and family remember him as having been a true friend and neighbor to them. Among his many charitable works, he established the Ogoni Agricultural Estate as the site for a new farm and it is currently inhabited by only a few families. Recently, the government of Sierra Leone ordered all Christian orphanages to close their doors and all orphanages affiliated with Christian Organizations to ensure that the orphans stay in the homelands. The unfortunate orphanage owners were targeted and some were even beheaded for their alleged support and sympathies for the government. Recently, Governor met with representatives of Christian Organizations and orphanages and urged them to close their orphanages and homelands but did not mention orphanage orphans. According to Governor, the orphanage orphan has been operating with Christian Organizations as its only orphanage. Governor also admitted that the orphanage orphanage has plenty of room to run with just a few families. All orphanages must be converted into orphanages to avoid problems from the Christian Organizations. Meanwhile, Governor met with some Christian pastors and Evangelical leaders and urged them to convert their organizations into orphanages. Meanwhile, Governor discussed how to handle the problem of orphans and how much blood we will need to be used in the conversion of orphanages into orphanages.

A woman was attacked, kneed on the street and had her throat slit in Makeni Sowing district in the Northern Cape province of Abidjan. The incident took place on the evening of January 17th in front of the home of a relative. The accused were playing a game of chance with the sacred uda. When the game was over, the accused burst into the relative's home and slit the woman's throat. The relative died on the spot but her house was ransacked. The accused fled the scene but not before one of them had managed to escape to Senegal. The identity of the next of kin has not been disclosed. Unfortunately, all our services were lost in the earthquake and the situation necessitated me to seek refuge in a political Asylum in Dakar Dakar or any other European Country for safety. Unable to do the political Asylum business due to the high risk and unable to transfer my money, I am reluctant to invest this money into a politically unstable country like Nigeria for fear of political instability. Therefore, I need a Foreign partner who can help me transfer the money overseas prior to my death so as to facilitate the smooth transfer of this money into his/her account. Please, I need your asistance and co-operation to enable this transaction succeed. The money will be divided as 50% for you and 35% for us. I will be glad to accept any assistance you can render to enable us conclude this transaction as soon as I receive your response. Please, I need your asistance and co-operation to enable this transaction succeed, especially since I am a woman. I will be very much obliged to entertain any male who is capable of assisting me in this transaction and have a word with him. Your earliest reply to this mail will be appreciated.

When I was a boy, my mother used to say that  her last wish was that all my generation  should gather around her and pray for her. I believe She knew that I  am not the only one who will die someday. My father  before he died was a very prosperous farmer and he was killed  in a car accident, but according to legend he was just a stone's throw from the  house when he was killed. He was martyred by the rebels in  the town where he lived.  Because of this I had to run away from home all through  high school, until I got married to  my late husband. When my late husband was still alive, he deposited the sum of  $15 Million USD (fifteen Million USD) with a security company in Europe, which  he called as his last wish. Since then I have been hiding the money for my future  self. Now I want you to help me collect this money and dispatched it to  churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the society pursues justice and truth  in all its  endeavors.  I have decided to give you 25% of the total fund for your assistance. I  will prefer you contact through email, but if you can not  reach me through email, I will simply leave it there. If you can help my  situation, I would like you to help me  to secure an ambulance and team for  this job, as I cannot come over land from my country for  proper burial, as my  doctor told me to come down to Europe first to  ascertain the status of the deposits and then I  will come over to your country to continue my studies. I  will like to invest in real estate and to  clear my account in Europe and also to  further my studies.  Please do not fail to always  send the above enquiries to my private email address jeremy_taylor@yahoo.com Contact me on my private email address jeremy_taylor@yahoo.co.in Regards Mr. Joseph Taylor.

$15,000,000.00 USD. This amount has been in my possession since late last year,when rebel forces were closing in on our location and it was discovered that the rebels had buried some of the dead with the body parts amounting to US $15 Million Dollars. Late payment and discovery complicated the process and by the late summer of last year, we were alone in the bush of Abidjan. We were attacked by the rebels forcing us out of our refuge and we were lucky to escape with only very light wounds. The only thing that saved us was the discovery of the last of our last deposit which was deposited in a security company in Europe some months back. I will like you to help me retrieve the deposited vault key from the security company and bring it back to my . You will be working for me as the vanguard of my family and I will be providing the security and intelligence connection to the process. If accepted, you will help me to bring the vault key to your country and into your possession. Then you will help me to invest the fund in your country using the proceeds from the investment. The only limit is your ability to invest. I will give you 20% for your company and another 10% for expenses that will be made during the process of this transaction. I will be monitoring this whole thing day and night. If you are unsure on what to do, get back to me. Also, do not fail to mention the amount of money in the vault to me so that I will know their location. I will do my best to locate it, but cannot guarantee that it will be there when I am there, but I will try my best to be there for you when you contact me. If this is ok by you, please get back to me. This is my only means of contacting you. Thank you very much. Yours Faithfully Dr.Fadi Ali.

A few weeks ago, my boss and I were having lunch at his place, and I mentioned to him that I am moving my family over there to Dubai, the first and only country I have been to in my life, because I am married to Hebaam a Kurd from Sierra Leone. He told me that the only people he knows of is the rich Bedouins of the plains, that they have enough to eat and that he will send for me when I finish my work. When he had finished, he came over to see me and told me that he has 5.2million British Pounds. This is the only thing he told me before he left the hospital. Now I don't know how I will ever get over my shock of the situation, because I did not mean to upset him; I just want him to know that the money belongs to me and my only son. He has been praying for me to tell him the truth of what I am telling you, because he knows that I will not rest till he gets it. He has asked me to get a reliable foriegn partner that can help me come over there and share the money with him. I am scared that if I do not tell him now that he is the one that is helping me, he will run and hide before my eyes.I want you to please get in touch with my Boss and tell him that you are my only son and will be over there immediately. He will come over to meet me and we will both go into Dubai together if only you tell me where you are willing to send for him. When I get your consent, we will both go there and share the money. I have told you where I will send for him and he has told me where he will send for me. I will also be willing to pay you a reasonable percentage for the trust you showed him in trusting you to handle this. Please I implore you to always be prayerful all through your life because the Lord is my shepherd and he shall see me through my faithful efforts. My heart goes out to you because I am afraid that with strong willed would be impetuous and may even betray the trust I have reposed on you. I implore you to always be prayerful all through your life because the Lord is my shepherd and he shall see me through my faithful efforts.

May the almighty God bless you and may God have mercy on you. Sincerely yours. Mrs. Aida Radwan.

If you are not familiar with this organization, please take a minute to get to know it before continuing. It is an ethical business organization that I founded in 2002 with my husband's assistance.We were headed towards establishing a charitable trust account in Africa when my late husband was alive, but unfortunately it was jolted by the political crisis in Ivory Coast. I have since been forced into hiding as I am afraid of reprisal from both my husband and the mob that roamed the streets. In an effort to protect my children, I escaped my hiding place with my husband's son. I will be very glad if you can assist me in transferring my late husband's Funds into your account for onward investment.Bow to me in the name of God for granting this transaction.

In case you don't know, but i dont want you to know, i have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems ,i  have been on chemo and radiation therapy all through my early years.  until this year, i was living in a hospital in Spain, but due to my condition i was moved to a special type of hospital here in Cotonou, Benin Republic, where my doctor has been performing my surgery and has given me the good news that with the right amount of support and help from both of us,i will be able to travel to any part of the world for my later surgery and rebirth as a realman.

In line with my assignment, I now seek your permission and assistance in transferring these funds out of Nigeria for safe keeping abroad and also for investment purpose, as you remember my earlier suggestion to you.
