SO FAR MY MOTHER HAS LEFTED US (FROM INSTANT ACCESS TO MY MOTHER'S ACCOUNT) SOME MONEY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY.  MY LATE MOTHER WAS VERY CHIRPOUS AND I DON'T WANT MY FATHER TO KNOW ABOUT THIS CHANGES.  MY CHIRPOUS FATHER DOES NOT KNOW THIS CHANGES AND THE RELATIVE ATHS OF MY HUSBAND FOR CONDUCTING THIS BUSINESS IS THAT HE IS ALSO DEAD (AND HIS AFFILIATE HAS LEFTED US) AND THE BUSINESS IS NOT UNDER MY CONTROL.  I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT  BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE BUT CAN ONLY  BE APPROVED TO ANY SECURITY COMPANY FOR SECURITY reasons  (1) MY FATHER HAS AN INVALID CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT (2) THE OUTSTANDING PARTICULARS OF THE OUTSTANDING  BANK COMMENTATING DEPOSIT ARE ALSO ADDED. THIS IS WHY I WANT YOU TO  ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS MY PROPOSAL, REPLY ME SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE LAYOUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, I WILL OFFER TO OFFER YOU 20% OF THE $21,000.00, WHILE THE  AMOUNT GIVES YOU PERCENTAGE FOR YOUR EFFORT.

 My Dear One, I am Mrs Maria Supranou, I am 59 years old and the only surviving daughter of Late General Sani Abacha the present Head of State of Nigeria and the former head of state of Sierra-Leone. Following the military coup d'etat of General Sani Abacha by the US Government, I escaped to South Africa and presently am living in South Africa as a political refugee. After the  death of my father, my mother and I decided to move out of South Africa because our father wanted us to settle down and not let all his wealth be donated to us by the late General Sani Abacha. After the death of my father, I decided to donate this fund to either a Revolutionary Spiritual Movement or a better Human rights Activist. I want this fund to be used wisely for the development of the poor and the social and political uplift of the whole society.  My father used his wealth to fund the upliftment of the poor and the uplifting of the whole society. My mother used her wealth to fund the upliftment of the poor and the uplifting of the whole society. She died after the  birth of my brother in 1988. Since my mother died, I have been raised by my mother alone, and my father does not know about the  alleged  funds in the dormant account he created for her. Presently, I am seeking for a man who can assist me to transfer this fund over to his country for  investment purposes, as I do not want to invest this fund in a South African Economic Exploitation/Prospect. I want an individual who can assist me to transfer this fund to his country for  investment purposes, as I do not want to invest this fund in a South African Economic Exploitation/Prospect.

 Reply Soon. Attn: President/Ceo. STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL RE: TRANSFER OF US$18,000,000.00 (EIGHT Million U.S. Dollars Only) TO YOUR ACCOUNT. I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but is really a privilege to reach you, based on the nature of this business. Before the blow of the 2008 global financial crisis, I was entrusted with the management of a dozen or so huge contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, between my ministry and foreign partners, that were executed successfully with the co-operation of top officials at the Department of Minerals and Energy in KENEMA. All top secret top secret contract documents have been carefully packaged and shipped since last November, so that by the middle of next month, all top secret contract documents will be ready for shipment to you. At this point all we need from you is to provide us with your private telephone and fax numbers and also your direct fax number that can facilitate us to claim the check from the Customs and Financer. Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this easy money to our advantage.  Interested parties can contact me by return mail to be sent to: strickovic_prince@yahoo.com Best regards, STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL My Regards, S. John Strickovic.

 Mrs. Mary Kom Hello Dear Friend. Let me start by introducing myself to you. I am Mrs. Mary Kom, the wife of Mr. George Kom, the former partner of the one   of the biggest oil and gas exploration and production company in Nigeria.  This is a client that I had made in my office,  Last year, during my husbanding, he   drilled an exploratory well in the Bazamite oil district and was commissioned to  produce 1,500 barrels of crude oil per week, per  contract paid for  by the government of Nigeria.  During my husbanding, George was so busy  that he did not   bother to fill any    contracts that was drawn before his death.   After my husbanding, George was too  busy  to   bother to fill any   contracts that was drawn before his death.    I did not  forget my  husband, I just did not    mention him to his family as  the   next of kin.    I cannot tell you the amount of money I have in my freezer

I am a married mother of three boys, all of whom are 11 years or younger. My husband is a retired oil explorer/minister and the father of the youngest is a student of chemical engineering. Recently, his business interests and circumstances made it very difficult for him to handle some of the business transactions, which he was fully capable of carrying out. After the last   transaction, which involves the repurchase and sale of some  inventory, he decided that he needs a partner whom he can rely on for this important  business he valued at $5 million. He has agreed to give you 20% of the total sum, 60% for me and my partner and 10% for any expenses incurred during the process of this transaction. Please be informed that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free and that I am not aware of any emerging trend that will affect the successful completion of this project. I would appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter, as I know only my husband's innermost secrets. My  husband is a firm believer in God,   that which he has stood for should be treasured and propagated, that is why he has concentrated on his work and not  let anything approaching the  truth about me. He has asked me to convey to you his desire to sell  his remaining stocks in the hope that you will be his partner in this  transaction. Should you be  interested, please send your private telephone  number and name of business, to my private telephone number : 234 887 7035 or  private number 234 887 077035 The message you will receive will be as follows: Dearie, I am Mrs Helen  Wilson, a widow to late Mr Carlos Wilson,    My husband was a retired director of sugar refining company called "Golden  Stone Sugar"   He was killed in 2003 by the rebels in the land war in Zaire.

Title: BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 BUSINESS ASSISTANCE Attn: President/Ceo. I am Mr.Joseph David Jose, a senior staff and auditor officer in the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles. I write you in respect of the need to have a foreign Affiliate in the near future. My department has approved the acquisition of a Votomatic Machine for the purpose of refunding over $26.5 Million to Votomatic Purchaser/Reseller. This contract has been executed and commissioned. The contractor has been awarded a contract for the supply of power to the motor vehicles.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing and capable to assume this contract, the payment of this contract will be passed on to you on our behalf by the bank. The total contract cost of $26.5M is being traced to avoid over-invoicing of a contract. We have negotiated our best offer to the contractor, who will be entitled to 40% of the total contract sum. Should this proposal be acceptable to you, be informed that a cover letter will be sent to you outlining your position and also requesting for a meeting to discuss your contract and location. Should you be willing to assist in this transaction, you will be rewarded with 10% of the total contract sum. Should you be able to confirm your interest and capability to assist me, please allow me a couple of days in gathering necessary information about you. Yours faithfully, Joseph David Jose (Private email: josephjoseph@myway.com)

 Re: Have a Nice Day Reader, John Phillips from Eritrea i am John Phillips age 26 years old the son of late Chief Joseph Phillips who was killed by the rebels in the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire. My father was a highly reputable BUSINESSMAN, he was the general Manager of sugar andamp; tobacco in (Eritrea). We were a prosperous farm family, producing blueberries, melons, papaya, nectarines and other fruit juices. Following the cease fire agreement which was reach year before last year with the help of international monitors, my father requested for a transfer of my mother and my younger sister to (Eritrea) so that he could be on the move during the week, and then sleep at night. My father told me that he deposited the sum of twelve million dollars($12,000,000.00) in a security company in (Eritrea) which he declared as family treasure. He did not disclose the name of the security company to me, I was afraid that if I were to disclose the content to anybody they may take away my father assets which is very ungrateful. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me through (john_phillips_Eritrea@yahoo.com) if you are interested. Best Regards, John Phillips

You are of course going to be  entitled to a significant portion of this money, as it accrues over time. I assure  you that it is very secure and risk free, as all its properties were  secured  before I discovered   how much is in there. If you are interested, please send me your full name and address   telephone number, and I will direct you to the contact of the Security   company.    I look forward to a favorable response from you. Regards, Peter Coffey

Title: Good Day
 Good Day Attn: Sir/Madam, My name is Miss. Elizabeth Ogali, I am 18 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.Ogali. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad,no other person knows of his sudden death.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on December 15th 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he called to inform her that he called to inform her that he called to inform her that he called her name.    The uncle who did this is a foreigner here (in Cote d'Ivoire)and since I am a princess he wants me to use her name because he has given her away that he used her maiden name.    I don't want this to happen to any other girl,I am just 18 years old and really don't know what to do. Now I want an uncle whom I can trust whom I can rely on      to handle this transaction with me,I will let you know that all the documents covering this transaction are with me and the documents cover my mother's identity as the beneficiary of this fund.    Upon your acceptance to work as my partner, you will be given 25% of the total fund,while 70% will be invested meaningfully for us. I will let you know    that there is no risk at all as I have taken care of all the modalities to ensure a hitch-free transfer. I will give you more info when I hear from you. Feel free to ask questions. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated.Best regards, Miss.Elizabeth Ogali.

 Reply Soon Dear, Good day to you. I, Jiyo cricket, from Ivory coast,   wish to apply through this medium for your humble assistance and also to go into business partnership with you,i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you. I am Miss. Fadilah, from Ivory -Coast   except for the three months of monsoon season. I am 22 years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR. and MRS. Mohamed. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory -Coast during monsoon season. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.   But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on November 5th,2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a box deposited with a security company in Madrid Spain containing $20,000,000.00 US DOLLARS. He did not disclose the name of the security company to the security company.   He did not say where the box was deposited or what security code number it was registered with.   He did not inform the security company that he has changed his last name to Mohamed.   I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do. He gave me all the authority  to change his   last name to Mohamed. I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do.   I  discovered that my father has a deposit account in a Security company in Madrid Spain   which he kept for me in a very sensitive file.I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do.   I  don't want to invest this money in the country where I don't know my  father, I don't want to go back to Ivory -Coast where my  father was killed by one of his business associates.I don't want to  go to war zone here.Please, can you please assist me in

Weidner who used our name to come to our country and make a deposit in a Security Company in Europe. The money is US$17,750,000.00 (seventeen million and five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars only) which he intended to be transferred into a security company in a disguise. Unfortunately, this concealment was discovered by the Security Company Manager and he has  been charging us exorbitant amounts of money to cover the loss of the funds.This has led to our being out of the country on many times to negotiate on behalf of the Security Company and finally, he has it arranged that we will be coming over to his country for 25% of the total money.Please contact me immediately through the above Tel and Fax numbers for more details and the details of the transaction. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated. Best Regards, James Rogers.

 Re:PROCEED WITH LARGE PICTURE FROM:Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha. Kindly permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, the wife of Mr. Jameel Isa Kiatha, the former  head of state (President Jacob Zuma) of (Zulu)South Africa. Before the death of my husband, he revealed to me about the huge amount of money he deposited with a security company oversea in two trunk Box  Boxes, one box contained US$21,000,000.00 (Twenty One  million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars) and the box contained other valuables and materials as it was registered as family valuables and consignments. I have decided to solicit for your unreserved assistance to help me retreive these boxes from the security company and use them for investment purposes.   I will offer you 20% of the total fund once the funds have been transferred to your country.Please endeavour to observe high confidentiality on behalf of my family. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated. Kindly communicate your acceptance of this proposal so that I can  commence our formal relationship. Best regards, Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.

 It's a Wonderful Life. No worries. Hello Dear Sir/Madam, my name is Mrs. Zainab Sharif Ahmed, from Kuwait. I am married to late Mr. Mohamed Sharif Ahmed, a diamond dealer from Ivory coast. We were married for twelve years without a child. He died since time immemorial. Before his death, we were both devoted muslims and I lived my life as a devoted Christian, I was a devoted muslim and I died a devoted christian. Presently, I'm in a trance-like state ,as I write this email to you in jest, because I am faced with the dilemma of whether to contact you as a perishable assistance or a permanent donor, who will extend my last wish to you. I am in a trance-like state because I found out that there is a benefactor waiting for me in the bosom of Dr. Kaba Boka International, near Dakar Senegal.He left me a message stating that he deposited $15 million US DOLLARS (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) with my name as the beneficiary, as the beneficiary of the consignment.

Title: DONATION FOR PHYSICAL USE ONLY
 DONATION FOR PHYSICAL USE ONLY &gt; Dear Sir, As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.  I am Donato, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I failed many important life tasks, but I didn't give up on my dreams.    Though I know I will die soon, I want you to  help me find a donor for me who is willing to give  me a helping hand in receiving my wealth as I don't want  any one to receive the wealth in cash, as that is what the rich do not know about  me. I will want you to help me collect the funds and deliver them to  the  charity  organization, and then I will transfer them to your country. Please, if I am not able to receive your  donation in person, then you can contact my lawyer, who will transfer them to your  country. For security reasons, I will not issue out more than one  donation to you at a time, since I am running out of time in the month of April.   Please, if you are interested, reply me. Yours  sincerely, Donato Donato (U.A.E.)

It will be very beneficial if you can allow me and lead me to the right channel towards acquiring these consignments for my personal investment.   Once the consignment is acquired, I will send to you, I will give you a reasonable part of the money, as that is the only money left for my own investments. I will also issue you a new email (belfort_jose) to receive periodic email updates from me.   Please feel free to give me your personal contact details, for more clarification and details purposes.   Best Regards, Mr.Joseph Belfort. Email: josebelfortruth@yahoo.fr  Enjoy your stay. Email: josebelfortruth@yahoo.fr

Title: Dr. Mary A. Koning
 Dr. Mary A. Koning I am Dr. Mary A. Koning from Ivory Coast. I am married to Late Zainab Abdul Koning who worked with Ivory Coast embassy in Belgium for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both a family of four. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$12Million) (Sixteen Million United States Dollars) in a security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem.The thing that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church or a individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this fund to be used in all sincerity for the uplifting work of God. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. This is why I am taking this stand. Please endeavour to observe utmost secrecy, as  ungodly persons may well be among you. I expect to hear from you soon. With your help, I feel certain that this will be accomplished. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Mary A. Khoning.

Title: Email from Mr. Shirin Ebadi
 Email from Mr. Shirin Ebadi Dear Friend, I was a student of mine in the year 2004. Since 2004, I have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.Recently, I had my  colonoscopy and I discovered that I have colon cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical  estimates. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I  despicably neglected my duties as a father before my ill state. Though I am very rich, I was never  generous, I was always hostile to people and only  treated them like   parasites.    I detested the thought of   sharing my wealth with   them, as I know that                                                                               The wealth is just

From: Mrs. Azura Amanda Kupolova
Title: Hello, Sir
 Hello, Sir Hello, Sir I know this mail will come to you as a surprise, let me introduce myself to you by telling you the truth about me. I am Mrs. Azura Amanda Kupolova the wife of Major Moussa Kupolova, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de–camp to the exiled president, Charles Taylor. On the 21st of August 2000, my husband and his wife were involved in a car accident along Pretoria to Johannesburg high speed. Both occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my husband relatives but to no avail, hence I contacted you.I therefore seek your consent to move to private bank account in your country where I will transfer this fund into the bank where I will invest this money over there in good faith with you in mind. I will arrange for the release of all my late husband's documents including the bank where this money is being stored. I will also apply for a diplomatic link to your country for us to move this fund out to. I will give you every detail of how this is going to be accomplished and the type of security company you will use. Lying in the middle of the night on a military base is not going to help me. I will apply for diplomatic link to your country immediately you indicate your interest to work with me. I will also issue to you a power of attorney, which you can then represent me in any legal matter. I want this transaction to be concluded within the shortest possible time, as i will apply for a leave as soon as i hear from you to come and claim this fund which is being guarded since i have been disqualified from having my picture taken or speaking with the public eye since i am no longer in the position to transfer the fund. May i never to hear from you again, or should i move on? Please reply as soon as possible to this email address (asstmr_mohy_072@yahoo.com). Regards, MOHY  M. KUPOLOVA

I am sorry if the contents hereunder are contrary to your moral ethics. On behalf of the bank I write this letter seeking your assistance in the area of my business before my   conscience tells me otherwise. I want you to know that although I know this may seem strange to you, it is my duty to seek for a reliable and honest person who will not put up with any kind of indiscretion, especially, immoral as it may be. During the last crisis, which is still ravaging in my country, one Mr. Robert Davies was subjected tohumiliating  torture and death  on the orders of his superior. Since then I have gathered many documents that will prove you as the one who contacted me the day before the crisis  broke out. Among these is a very important document that will  prove to be of mutual benefit to both of us. It is this document that will establish you as the  beneficiary of this huge amount of  funds, since it has been deposited by someone else and is the only surviving copy of the document. I am aware that this move is to  sully your name with regard to this transaction, but do consider this.  It may come to you as a surprise, but I implore you to consider this proposal  conceptually. Should you be of assistance to me, I will be glad.  I assure you that this is not mandatory nor will it be something  that will prevent you from obtaining a residence permit in your country. Upon your acceptance to this proposal, I will provide you with more  information, and also you will be given an opportunity to  respond to this mail. Feel free to keep this proposal  in mind as we proceed. I look forward to your favourable response. Best Regards,    Mr. James Tobi

 Mrs Isabella Stevens. Dear Sir/Madam, May the blessing of God be upon you and grant you every comfort.Please permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Isabella Stevens, am the wife of late Mr Stevens. I was a wife to Late Mr Stevens, a contractor with the City of Kirkuk in Iraq. He died following a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before my husband was killed on 16th.Feb. 2005, he made a deposit of $17,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million Dollars Only) with one private security company in Abuja, Nigeria. The amount was meant for the importation of machinery for the construction of the mega dam under construction by the foreign contractors and for the initial purchase of new machines for the importation of machinery for the construction of the dam. After the death of my husband, I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $17,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million Dollars Only) with one security company in Abuja, Nigeria. Presently, this money is still with the security company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to an inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being very tired and I have been on bed rest most of the past two weeks due to the operations.

 Reply soon. Attn: President/Ceo. General Edward Kama. EVANS POINT,N.W.T.  Dear Sir,  My name is General Edward Kama, I worked with the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Kenya for nine years before I resigned from the government in favour of private equity and investment. I have a proposal about an off-take gas servicing and gas trading business.  I have discussed this with a national gas trading company and they have agreed to supply us with  equipment and supplies which we can use in laying pipeline and laying mines. We have 30 days to utilize this equipment and supplies in laying pipeline and laying mines.  We will use part of this equipment for our own benefit as well as that of our clients.  You are free to choose any option you want as long as it maintains the integrity of the equipment and supplies. I intend to utilize this equipment  for my own benefit.  This is very important as I am not in any manner involved in the financing or allocation of lines or lines of this pipelines projects. I would however, like to know the   extent of your acquaintance with my situation. I will be honored if I am able to establish a dialogue with you.

 From: Mr.Pieson John. Email:johnpieson2001@yahoo.de Dear Friend, Good day to you. I got your contact in cause of a seriouse search on the web for someone who could take care of my family  for the next ten days. Without fail,I will give you 100% satisfaction if you can                                                                                                                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE. As you may or may not be aware, my father (REPUBLICAN LEADER) was assassinated on the 21st of April 2001 by one of his bodyguards,who was also his private secretary, this is a matter of some indisputable historical record. Though the motive for the killing is yet to be established, the most likely one is connected to the financial crisis that was rocking the country that year. The other main reason is the dramatic increase in the price of oil that was impacting all aspects of our daily lives. My father especially was a businessman and had in stock positions of major suppliers, for instance,                                                                                 Unfortunately, he did not list all his major suppliers on the receipt of this mail, and as a result the bullet that killed him accidentally was not detected by the security company that monitored his movements that summer; therefore no one knows about this or about the high price of oil that was also affecting all aspects of our lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 N.B-PLEASE DO NOT LET ME KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS SUBJECT.

I am married to Mr.Williams Jonassen ... who worked with Ivory Coast Embassy in Dakar Senegal for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both dedicated christain. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he made a huge deposit in my name in a security company in Dakar Senegal. Presently, this deposit is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my   ailment I have decided to donate this fund to either a church, individual or a ministry that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this fund to be used in the Orthodox Church,Churches,Orphanages and Widows. If you  find any interest in this letter,please do reply me immediately and I will give you further clarifications.

 REPLY ME NOW Attn:president/queene Dear Colleagues, I write to seek for your unreserved assistance to my situation now and in future. I am Barrister Elaine Kam and I was the personal attorney and legal adviser to Late Mr. Joseph Bendik, a national of your country, who used to be a contractor with notary public. On the 21st of April, 2004, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my client extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of my Family, this is why I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by Late Mr. Joseph Bendik which I will require your assistance to secure and transfer out of Sagamu island to your country. The amount of the money is Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$28.5M). I will provide all necessary information needed to secure the release of the deposit and transfer the funds to your private account. I will not contact any person until you are happy to receive the funds, as my Family history is full of such incidents. I prefer for it to be a long-term relationship, because otherwise, relations will be discouraged to receive such amount of money from my late client. I will give you further details when and if required. Regards, Barrister Elaine Kam. Barrister Elaine Kam.

 GOOD  DAY Attn; I am Mrs. Lulu Abacha, the former head of state of Nigeria and former Prime Minister of Nigeria before he was overthrown out of power by American Government during the American occupation government. Since the death of Mr. Abacha, the people of Nigeria have gone through considerable hardships and sufferings. This is because American Government has full control over our government and our economy. This has caused great hardships to our society. As a result of this, millions of lives have been lost in the name of religion, caste system and so on.  I came to know about you in my private email account. It is through you that I discovered that you are an international business individual who can help us out in flow of the funds to your country.Please feel free to give your consent to the Fidelity Security Trust Company to send the funds to your nominated bank in your country.Please note that we are not told anything about this transaction until the funds are in your account.

Title: As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. I am  Mary, son of Late Zulu King Horacio Bitoni, and the only daughter of my father. My father was killed by one of his chief advisers during the transition period from formal to informal presidential rule in my country, Zulu-National Parties to the advantage of my father. This was after he had been subjected to long and sometimes violent political crises by the supporters of one of his major political opponents, the leader of which was the present chief negotiator for the release of some political detainees held since the removal from office of president Blaise Compagnie de Sankoh by the opposition parties. Upon the death of my father, I and my mother were forced to leave the country, but before we could get out, we were forced to give up our arms against our will to agents of the security company, who threatened to arrest us if we do not give up our arms. We were forced to run away from home, and as our father's friends did not want us to stay, so we ran to another country where we are now taking refuge.  Presently,I am in Dakar-Senegal for the investment projects with my own share of the total investment. I will be happy to inform you if you are interested in this proposed investment project which is of mutual benefit to all three of us.  Regards, Mary, Mary Jonson,  Willsiams Jumboree International

Title: GOOD DAY.
 GOOD DAY. Dear Sir, I am J.Smith the son of late Chief Joseph Smith,  a former military  chief and the financial manager  of our area.  My father was killed by a rival gang, the Kurukshetra  Rebels and I was a small boy. My father was killed by the rebels because he  refused to become a member of one of their  cliques and actually  told them that  they  were  not allowed to join  any of their cliques.  When my father was  on his death bed, he  revealed to me  that he  gave all  the certificates of his business  investments to  his two closest relatives, one  of whom is dead and the  other one  is alive and  still living in prison because  my father  was a member of the rebel group.  He also gave  me all the  contact  information  of my father's business associates and    even   the  telephone number of the  security company, which  is  proof that  you are who   I am supposed to  prove    out     any

Title: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr. J.P.Oyune, the personal assistant to the former Director General of Logisticate,In the Ministry of Finance, together with two of our colleagues. One of the partners was a member of the XIMBABWE-STABLE, the other was a director in PHILCO-AMERICAN REMITTANCE CENTER. I and my colleague also collected some funds from the Department of Mineral Resources and the Central Bank of Nigeria and transferred them into a security-proof box, before we left Nigeria for Europe. After the sudden death of our chief, Mr.N.Dutu, and the subsequent kidnapping of our colleague by the rich and the bad actors in the society, we decided not to live in fear and not to take any chances. We dropped our programme confidential data and secrets between each other and discovered to our own satisfaction that our own firm did not know anything about the consignment. We decided to destroy it and we also destroyed all the documents concerning it. We destroyed it because we cannot afford to send the amount of money to anybody. The reason why we destroyed it is that the bad actors who kidnapped our colleague have already deposited some amount of money with one of the Security Company. There is a demand here in the   region for a foreign firm to assist us in transporting this amount of money. We decided to destroy the box with the money on the assistance of our partners because the bad actors have already made arrangements for the withdrawal of some amount from our country. We will need your honest co-operation to enable us accomplish this transaction successfully. Please get back to us as soon as possible to enable us obtain the consignment and collect the funds from the security company. We will be honored to have your company as our partner in Nigeria. Your services will be highly appreciated. Thank you and God bless. Sincerely yours. Mr.J.P.Oyune.

 Attn: President/Ceo Attn: President/Ceo I know this mail will reach you as a surprise, nevertheless I am Mr.Steven Steven Smith, aged 59 years, the son of late Chief Joseph Smith, a national of your country, whom I was privileged to have in possession of two trunk Boxes, one containing 10,000 dollars, the other containing 100,000 dollars. Both trunk Boxes were shipped by a security company, the shipping of the Boxes was confirmed to the security company through the Federal Ministry of Food Safety and Department of Internal Affairs. The security company has since been waiting for the Minister of Health and Family Welfare to designate the seach as a pro rata national, to enable the shipping of the Boxes could not be delayed any further. As it was discovered that both trunk Boxes contain the exact same amount of money, the security company has been examining the boxes to discover the identity of the consignments. The company has also been mandated to keep a close eye on the consignments and it is very unlikely that they will be moved without the signature of the security company. While I will admit that I had no idea that I am going to find myself in this position, I knew that there was going to be a lot of money involved. I decided to lance this transaction, so as to prevent a situation where this money will be used in an unwise manner. I will be going in for the inspection, so as to make sure that everything is in order. Should you be interested, I will give you more details. Please endeavour to contact me immediately for more clarification. Looking forward to hearing from you. Warmest regards, Mr.Steven Stephen

 URGENTLY REPLY ME(More to come) Greetings, I am Mr.Giulian D'Alessandro, a freelance computer programmer based in Italy. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I was never a very sociable person. But now I know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way.  I would have a second chance to be with God, as I was before I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.  I want God to give me a second chance to come to this world.   I am going to be resting where I am going to rest until God calls me.   I will be communicating with you by email address.   I will not be able to communicate with you by email address because my computer is currently undergoing testing.   Please endeavour to keep me informed of all developments in my treatment with regards to my health.   You can also reach me through email address.  I will be grateful if you could reply to my letter. God bless you.  Mrs. Elizabeth D. Brown

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise, but need not to worry. It comes with the good wishes of my life.

After the death of my husband, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home,  hence my decision to leave Nigeria for safety and for a better life of my life. I am presently residing in Dakar senegal, but presently planning to relocate to your country for investment purposes. For your safety, I want you to contact my lawyer,a top lawyer in th e country, who will offer you a compensation if you can be of an assistance to me.

 Good Day. Hello and God bless you, I am Mr. Jesús Felix Ortiz, the son of late Chief Joseph Ortiz, from Ecuador. I am contacting you in respect of a potential investment I believe we can do together, that will be announced in due course. My father was the general Manager of Ecuador Beverage and is perhaps best known for establishing and maintaining the La Côte d'Ivoire Chamber of Commerce and has long been regarded as one of the richest men in the country. Before his death, he was assassinated by four gunmen reportedly motivated by revenge for a political attack by the Marxist rebels.

I know this is an unusual approach but I was brought up in a house that  valued things over  three  years. My mother raised me in faithfulness to the ways of the  world  and I  discovered a wealth of investment dapps. I have searched the world wide net  for investment  partners and have  decided to invest my money  in your country  because I have found that the world economy is my  oyster. There is a wealth of investment dapps  floating around in the global markets and I just dont  have the  capital to invest in a whole bunch of them. I know that  after my business is done I will leave  you the balance of my investment dappered  to you. I will give you  more details when I hear from you. Best Regards &gt;nelson mike

Title: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.
 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE. Attn: President/Ceoaw! In a nutshell, I am Barrister David Kim, aged 59 years, the personal Attorney to Late Engr. Wong Yuk-shek, a national of your country, who used to be a contractor with state-owned isbronze metal ore mining company in Sinkiang Province. On the 21st of April 2004, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a house explossion at the "Lloyang Copper and Gold Mine" about 30 minutes from Nanning. On the way back, they stopped at Shenzhen town to look for a suitable land owner who could be placed as the next of kin to the deceased. After searching for some time, they settled on this as the next of kin since they all resided on the same land. As next of kin, it is incumbent on him who placed me as his next of kin to lay claims for the deceased person's assets, which they all have in common. As next of kin, it is also my obligation to negotiate with the local government to purchaseout plots in his name for the development of the properties, and also to purchase a plot of the respective land next of kin to the deceased, since the properties have been built on different plots of the same land. As next of kin to my client, it is also my right to demand that the properties be released to him, since he has expired the beneficiary of the properties. As next of kin, it is also imperative that I obtain a power of attorney to run the properties as his overseas partner, since the properties are made under his orders. Finally, it is imperative that I maintain this level of confidentiality due to the nature of this business. As the personal attorney, I have the authority to request for the release of the properties to me, and run afresh, as soon as my countrymenmenmen start associating with us. This is a legal matter that we must follow according to the advise of our legal associates, because as civil servants we cannot operate this business.  It will require a great deal of hard earned wealth to  enable my client get it, and I believe that each and every one of us will die someday. As such, we must unite to protect ourselves and our children. We must also relocate to a safer country for our children, so that their fathers and mothers will not forget our foolish ways. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact of the PRC Embassy in Sinkiang. Please ensure to contact me immediately to enable us discuss further.  With love and respect, Barrister David Kim.  Barrister David Kim.

Williams, wife of late Mr.John Williams, a national of your country and a private oil explorer/physicist with a drilling platform in Nigerian Sea. I am contacting you pursuant to the need to involve a foreigner with respect to my over-invoiced contract payment. As a result of the on-going problem with my country�s incumbent president, there was an opportunity for a foreigner to take over this contract from the hands of the government and actually deliver the actual contract to the tune of $22Million U.S. Dollars only. The contract was then already executed to the tune of $12Million U.S.Dollars U.S.Only. This is the reason why I am contacting you to assist me in replying to this email as soon as possible, otherwise all the important modalities to actually receive the contract amount will have been already worked out. I will be glad to apply for a visa to any foreigner that has the necessary valid passport and information of deposit with my private email address. All necessary arrangements have been finalised for the smooth conclusion within the shortest possible time as I will be coming over to your country to negotiate on behalf of my husband. Please endeavor to keep this transaction strictly confidential, as too much exposure would be detrimental. Hoping to hear from you soon. Thank you and God bless. Yours Sincerely, Mrs. Mary A.

 Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha Sir, I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha from Kuwait. I am married to late Mr. Mohammed Isa Kiatha who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he deposited the sum of $14.8Million (Fifteen Million,Eight hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars Only) in a security company , this fund was originally gotten from sales of Gold and Diamond in my country, Now my bank has released this fund to me because they discovered no gold or diamond inside the box. I have been told that since I have been divorced once I complete my term in office my share will be used to purchase a residential property in your country or anywhere else where there is demand. For now, I ask for your assistance to help me collect this fund from the security company and dispatch it to you, so that we can both move in for the transaction, and thereafter, you will be considered for the purchase of the properties. I will give the details on how we are going to move forward, once I hear from you. Keep me informed of any issues that might arise during the process. My contact address is enclosed in this mail so that i can you reach me. Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha

This is a problem of colossal magnitude requiring immediate international co–operation to alleviate. I hereby agree to agree to co–operate with you to the extent of sharing of profits,if at all, after the successful conclusion of this transaction. I will be happy to apply for a leave as soon as the funds get into your reliable account to come to your country for sharing.I want you to be assured that all arrangements have been concluded for the smooth conclusion of this transaction within the stipulated time frame. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this transaction. Thank you and God bless. Best regards, Mrs. Fatima Rasheed Khalifa

On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of myclients, this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no success.So now that I have confirmed that no trace of his relatives have been found, I decided to contact one of my friends who has been a missionary to help me locate any of his extended relatives. I contacted him through his private email Address, he confirmed the existence of this person and his extended relatives, so, I contacted him through email to verify his identity and the suitability of my proposal, he is willing to sponsor me to a business worth investing in your country if I can be of an assistance to him.Please if you are willing to assist in this regards, indicate interest immediately and follow through my proposal. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate  investor  profile, so your role will be that of  advisor to the investor. I will be giving you 30% of the total project cost, 5% for charity home and 10% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction, fax and phone  bills inclusive. I will be contacting you with my private phone number and my fax number. I will be communicating with you by Email only because my computer is not operational at the moment due to the nature of this transaction. Please get back to me immediately if you can be of an assistance.Yours faithfully, Mr. David Miller. - David Miller email: davidmiller_2002@yahoo.com

Although, my lawyer advised me that perhaps I should contact a relative or business associate to take us to a private firm that can assist us in placing orders in your country. I will be very happy if you can allow me and my lawyer to go ahead and place the orders for the pickup and shipment of your company's consignment in your country.For details and location instructions, contact my lawyer on his option.  MY RESPONSE TO THIS MATTER IS HEREBY GIVEN TO YOU.PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS MONEY IS CONFISCATED BY THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE POLICY AND AS A RESULT OF THIS, WE DO NOT WANT IT TO LEAVE THE PAST MONEY AS AN EXTRACT FROM THE BANK.

My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad,5th.Feb.2006.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before the death of my father on Febuary 5,2006 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a sum of US$22.5Million (twenty two million,five hundred thousand United States Dollars) deposited with a Security company in a security company name and age confidential, that the security company has since released and re-classified the security company name as cabinet name.I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality to assist me in securing this deposit and as such,i choose to contact you to assist me in retrieving it.And to secure a reliable foreign personality who can assist me in investing this money with you.I will be glad to go into partnership with you,if you can be of good assistance to me.I will be honored if I am given the privilege of assisting you in the process of retrieving the deposit.Please endeavor to keep this transaction strictly confidential, as such I will appreciate your utmost privacy in this regard.

 RE: TRANSFER OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS  (RE: TRANSFER OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS) Mr.Harry Kim, Fort Knox /Konec
 RE: TRANSFER OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS   Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr.Harry Kim, a member of staff in a Bank  Privately owned  Foreign Company  here in London . I am contacting you as our foreign customer to receive  a part of  the total sum of Twenty Million Dollars. This money was deposited  some years ago by my father and his colleagues and used as a Back ups  and as  proof of deposit for their next of kinies.  It is very important that we receive this money as next of kin to the    Next of Kin to the late owner of the bad loan, as no one is coming for it  and the Minister of State for Finance &amp;  Finance Ordinance made it illegal for a Bank to issue new  or renewal  certificates of deposit to any foreign customer. As a matter of fact, the  bank where this money was deposited is asking us to come forward as the  next of kin of the bad  loan, as next of kin to the deceased (for further  discussion and details). As foreign customers we  cannot operate foreign account and, hence, the bank where this  money was deposited was asking us to present our foreign  account where this money can be transferred to, as the  beneficiary of the bad  loan. As a staff, it will be impossible for me to use my  position to influence the decision making  of the board of directors, who will of course take their own  decisions. If you can be of an assistance,  I would be very much seeking your  co-operation. Thanking you for your interest. Regards, Mr.Harry Kim.

 Responses!! Dear Sir/Madam,  As you read this, I don‘t want you to feel sorry for me. I am Robert El Masri, a Saudi national, and one of the account officer of the Saudi Binladin LNG Lifting (SBGL) in L'Aquila.  I am contacting you as a foreigner with a very important and sensitive information regarding my role in the alleged takeover of the money and property of this Saudi Binladin LNG Lifting (SBGL) by foreign powers, which is reported to be your countryman.  Recently, this money was transferred to a security company, who were not privy to the content of the consignment.  Unfortunately, the content of the consignment was discovered to be fhe money of her late husband, the former Saudi oil minister, who mysteriously died in November 29th, 2004 during a flight from the PHANTOMIC plane crash, where he had taken flight.  It is very important that you disclose this information to us at least partially, so that we can  proceed.  We would like to begin by stating that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion within the next couple of days.  Upon receipt of the above information, we shall provide you with the link to the security company and telephone number to talk to the security company Representative. Please ensure to contact us immediately  upon receipt of the above information for further clarification and detailed clarifications, upon which we will issue you a letter of authorisation to proceed with the process of securing the consignment and subsequently the release of the funds.  Should you be interested, please send me your contact information below: Full Name : Full Phone / Fax : Direct Tel number : Regards, Mr.El Masri.

Kik e-mail: joseph_kangami@yahoo.com.hk MY PROPOSAL FOR AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN 1997.I have the courage to ask for your support in clearing an account of $30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) which I discovered dormant in an account that belongs to one of my customers.

It is also an offence to commit this offence within six months of commencement.I have all necessary information that can be used to trace the owner of this account back to his or her position at the time of opening the account.I have the authority of my account director to prove to you as the next of kin to the deceased.There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as all necessary modalities have been worked out in ensuring a hitch-free movement between us.

Title: Greetings.
 Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. I am Mrs. Gangeswary Kumar, husband to late Mr. Kumar Gangeswary. I was married to Mr. Kumar Gangeswary for eleven years without a child. During this period we were both  highly successful farmers. After the death of our husband, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which  the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive, he deposit the sum of $30,000,000 (Thirty Million, Fifty  thousand United States Dollars) with one of the Financial institution where he declared his interest. I have asked him to contact any of his extended  circle of business associates to facilitate the movement of this money to his country. He  advised that I should seek for a foreigner to stand as a next of kin to my late husband so that  I can transfer this money into his personal account abroad. I want  you to understand that the Bible is not in favor of polygamy and I don't  want you breaking the law. The Bible is very strict in this  matter. As soon as you accept to stand as a next of kin to my late husband,  you will be  able to transfer this money to his account. I will provide all necessary  details regarding the security and custody of this fund to you. I will also  issue to you a letter of authority/Power of Attorney that will prove you as the  next of kin to my late husband. I want you and the group of  you to always pray for me because the Lord work in mysterious ways. My happiness  is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the  Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through  your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a  Christian individual to carry out this  task for us. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein  in my letter of authorization.  Hoping to hearing from you. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Gangeswary Kumar.  YE MAIL ADDRESS IS:chamberedriveback@yahoo.fr

 Sir/Madam, Attn:President/Ceo. Sir/Madam, Attn:President/Ceo. My name is Simon Chapman, I work in the credit andaccounts department of Federal Republic of Liberia.I write you this letter based on the fact that over the years now I have been hearing from a lot of different people about this money problem.I have therefore concluded from the amount of money that is deposited and the fact that nobody has come to claim it, that somebody must be cheat and defrauding other people over this money.I have therefore decided to do the investigation andfinding of who the real owner is of the deposit.I believe you will not be surprised how I  conclude from the amount of money that is deposited about how I found out that the account has no other beneficiary and that the account has no dividends andno interest. The depositor has turned himself in and was seen with a picture with the documents of deposited funds. I have therefore concluded from the information gathered from the depositor that somebody is trying to claim the deposit and this is why I need your assistance to make claim of the funds. You will be given 20% of the total funds, 60% belongs to me and 10% is for expenses. Please contact me immediately if you are willing to assist me in executing this transaction effectively.You can also contact me on the above fax number with this mail address:iscash@zmobile.com Have a nice day and remain Blessed....

 FROM DANIEL  M  CAIN ADDRESS: CHURCH STATION NEAR MOSUL, IRAQI REPUBLIC. Dear Sir/Madam, Good day to you and my Sincere Friend. I know this mail will come to you as a surprise and if I am not understood/succesful, please, allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is Daniel  M.  M cocaine; I am the only son of Late One who died 4 years ago when I  was a soldier in the callous regiment of the U.A.E. I left the country with my mother and our only son, and am now seeking political asylum in one of the  neighboring countries. Recently, my doctor told me that I  had a dormant medical condition that would give me around  24 hours to live. This is a result of my  poor health as can be seen by the fact that I have not been seen in  a very long time. Also, I have not had any child  in the form of a born, adopted, or grandchild, all I have  is my mother's blood. If this is  not the intention of you, I urge you to disregard this and keep  away from me. Then, when your time comes, I will  give you all the information  needed to have me as your  next of kin.  I have all the necessary  information we need to accomplish this task. My  mother's relatives have already confirmed that  she is who she says she is, she never told  me that she has changed her mind and that the  man she husband used to husband used to her is not her  husband.  I will give you all the  contact name of my mother as well as the phone  number of her office. If you accept to help me and treat with  utmost confidentiality, I will be very glad.  If you do not, I will send to you all the  relevant documents pertaining to this transaction immediately.  With best regards, Daniel M.  M. CAIN.

 Good day Lloyd James,  Chambered in 14000 rounds per box. I have a new email address! You can now email me at:  joseph_kangami@yahoo.com A young man who must have passed through my email as he did not use it for the first time. I am Mr.Joseph Kangami, the man from South Africa who was the ring leader of the AFRIQUE MONEY PENDING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION,  which  is the body that deals on the international transfers of gold and other precious goods. I have in my possession, the sum of $15,000,000.00, which is twenty-five percent (25%) of the total money, and five percent (5%) for the expenses that may be incurred by us during the transfeiture, and another five percent (5%) to cover any expences that may be incurred by me during the course of transfeiture. I have the address of a security company that provides security for important commercial properties, and I have never disclosed the presence of this consignment to any security company. I have therefore met with the company to discuss the modalities of its delivery to the security company, which is currently under negotiation, but as presently the proposed transfeiture deals mainly with foreign partners. If you can be of an assistance to me, I would be pleased to apply to the company for the transfer of this deposit to your account. You will be given a negotiable percentage for your participation, and further details will be sent to you as soon as I hear from you. Regards and respect, Joseph KANGAMI Secretary, International Remittance Department

Title: FROM: Mrs. Frida Kaba. Abidjan Ivory Coast. PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS: Frida Kaba.021 Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Email: frida_aba@yahoo.fr Dear Beloved One.  I am Mrs. Frida Kaba, widow of late Mr. James Kaba, a wealthy oil merchant who sadly lost his life in a plane crash during the U.S. Airlines 85th anniversary year. You can still hear the engines of the ATR-84 leaving the airport in Abidjan after the visit of my husband to Abidjan - Cote d'ivoire. He was an oil merchant who felled tons of indigenous trees to grow sugar and wood in his sugar refinery.  He was among the few black Zimbabwean rich white farmer who depended on his huge farming land for his existence.  It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad, last year. He was 85 years old.  Before his death on 9th january 2002 ,he called me to his bedside and told me that he has a sum of US$18 Million (twenty Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand USD) he deposited in a three star hotel in Abidjan - Cote d'ivoire. He said that he deposited the fund with a security company, that he used my name as the next of kin in depositing the fund. He advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, that is, someone who can assist me in receiving the fund on my behalf.  I would request that you keep this letter tight secret because of his status at the time, I did not want my husband's relatives to know about this development.   We will discuss much in details in the mail, when I hear from you.  Thank you so much.  Best regards,  Mrs. Frida Kaba.  Email: frida_aba@yahoo.fr

I am making this letter to seek your assistance and also to secure an opportunity to invest and do joint business with you in your country. I would be honoured if I could be of assistance to you, which I know is a divine right given my father's position as the highest authority in my country. He createdamemble with me , am a solo mother of three, which is a stark contrast to the society where I am oppressed and suffer from insecurity of residence. Plus, I don't want to invest or do any business in his country where I am not in a position to have a major impact on the life of the family, as I am the only one with the legal documents to back up any given claim. I would be most grateful if you could allow me and my father look for a role model in your country who could guide and guide us, like a god fearing individual who will not sit on our behalf should we not prove him/herself. I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you, my life is so much easier now that I have recovered my freedom and independence. I am now in possession of a secured business passport and I am ready to commence any contract that would be of mutual benefit to us, especially as I have already taken legal measures to ensure a no risk situation on the outcome of any given transaction. For your percentage, I would like you to provide me with your telephone and fax numbers for quick communication, as I will be contacting you shortly to confirm the details of your business or if not, for the necessity of a third party to assist us on any lucrative business we may consider.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Attn: Sir/Madam. My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Kangaro, I'm a widow to Late Engr. James Kangaro, who unfortunately lost his life during the Viet Nam War. I am 65 years old, and am suffering from esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I was never a very good person. I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East &amp; Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as  they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million Dollars ($28,000,000.00) that I have with a finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10% for you. Please get in touch with me on my preferred email address: me@jamesangaro.com or my official email address: me_officially_jamesangaro@yahoo.com God bless you as you help me. Regards and Respect, Mrs. Elizabeth Kangaro.

 ATTENTION Attn, Please permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Dr. Richard Hatch, a senior staff accountant officer with the Federal Government of Nigeria. I discovered an unclaimed account with a standing balance of Fourty Million USD (Forty Four Million United States Dollars) in an account which I have in my office. The account has been dormant since its establishment and nobody except me,the account officer has ever operated on the account. I have therefore concluded every arrangement with the ambassador in Europe to get the funds transferred to his account. The arranged transfer is likely to be concluded within the next couple of days and the fund will be transferred into his account without delay. The transaction is 100% risk and trouble free. As far as I am concerned, the customer is no longer in the position to claim the account. It is only me and the account officer who will issue the authority for the transfer. For now, let me know if you will be interested. I will be waiting to hearing from you. Regards and Respect, Richard Hatch

He advised that I should leave the country immediately as soon as possible, if I do not become his partner in the country.  I want you to help me to ship the contents of the crate to any country of your choice and also reunite with my children who are not yet grown up.

I am Mrs. Rosalynn j. Watson  from Nigeria. I am the wife of late Chief Moussambani Badruddin, a diamond dealer. My husband was killed during the rebellion in Cote d'Ivoire. He was one of the few diamond dealers in Ivory coast before the uprisings started in 1999. Before the death of my husband, he deposit the sum of $4.5Million (Four Million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one of the Financial Institution and shipped it to his country. I want you to help me collect the consignments and deliver them to the Financial Institution where the consignment will be secured and registered as a consignment. I have made several unsuccessful attempts to contact any of the Financial Institution where the consignment was registered as a consignment, hence the concern and reluctance of most financial institutions to accept or acknowledge the delivery of consignments of this nature. I regret that I contacted you first because I don’t want to invest this fund in your country which is a sensitive and lucrative business. I don’t want to invest this fund unless you are willing to assist me in collecting the consignment and delivering the consignment to the Financial Institution. I will be honored if I am given the privilege of delivering the consignment to your bank. I have made up my mind to offer you 20% of the total fund once the fund reaches your country.

 From John H Pritchard Dear Sir, It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a suprise. This is because we have not met before but I have  ascertained from the  information gathered from the Internet, that you do not have to go any further than this initial  e-mail to receive this simple acknowledgement. I am Mr Honest John H Pritchard, the son of the late Chief Paul Pritchard, a former  director of operations for General Motors UK.  I am contacting you because I want you to assist me in selling in your country  the remaining of my fathers' Cargoment stored in a security company in Europe.  I will be contacting you as soon as I hear from you. Best Regards, John H. Pritchard.

Title: From Mrs.Gunnar Johansson. 
 From Mrs.Gunnar Johansson.  Gunnar Johansson.  ABIDJAN COTE D' IVOIRE Dearest One,  Permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Miss.Gunnar Johansson, the only daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Johansson. I am 25 years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the cote d' voire in this country. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.  It is sadder still to say that he was killed during the French Revolution.Though his sudden  death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on May 31st 2006 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a sum of £30,000,000 (Thirty Million British Pounds)with a security company in a security company at a secret location  branch in London.  He did not disclose the security company name to the  secretary   He instead registered the name 'UNKNOWN PARTNER' in the  security company.  He did not disclose the security company's true location to  her But she confirmed to the security company that the  security company was in London.   The security company also confirmed to me that the company does not know the  location of the security company's branch.  How can I be so safe from the Revolutionary  Police?  Suppose that my father's business partner dies and nobody knows about it  except me. What will happen then? I don't want a situation where my  father's business associates will fight me because the  Revolutionary can easily seize any safe place and blow  up the place.  What I am asking is that my father take the sum of ( Thirty Million  British Pounds) and  distribute it amongst his family members as soon as possible.  I want a situation where all my father's business associates  will come to my assistance and we can  work together to secure the release of the money  and  investment.  I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of managing this  fund  and using it for investment purposes.  I will be honored if you can help me out  to finish my education and also  transfer this fund to your account  abroad so that we can invest it in a profitable  venture.  Best Regards,   Mrs.Gunnar Johansson Mrs.Gunnar Johansson@LATEST EMAIL ADDRESS MRS.Gunnar Johansson

 From Mr. Rashidi Hasan Tel:+92-337416 Email: rashidi@zwallet.com With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal regarding a potential investment.I have the privilege of introducing myself to you based on my status as a journalist and my integrity as a business man. I am Rashidi Hasan the son of Major Hasan Panahi Hasan, former Iraqi refugee and a business merchant based in Côte d’Ivoire. I am contacting you in regards to my father's investment fund which he kept for us in a security company in Dakar,Senegal, upon his successful unconditional release from prison on August 2002.Presently,this fund is in the security company for safekeeping as a trunk box containing valuables and secret notes of high value. My father deposited this fund with a private Security company, that till date has kept the box containing the fund as a trunk. Lets say its worth $30 000,00USD. Due to the nature of this business, its highly confidential and the security company did not know the content of the box. The security company does not know that its contents are secret notes of high value. The security company does not want the fund to be released to the public as that would entail disclosing confidential information about the contents to the security company. Hence the reason I am contacting you, because I don’t want to divulge any part of the contents to the security company. This is because the content of this box is confidential and all the secrecy rests on my name as the only son. I am contacting you because I don’t want to go against the flow of this transaction. Hence the reason for writing to you. I will send you all necessary information including the contact of the Security company where the fund was deposited. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of the fund. I will issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of the fund. I will not relent until the fund is returned to you. I want you and the company to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a true devoted son and that I  lived a life of a true devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a devoted son.

Before the death of my husband, he made one deposit on a Cocoa company I am the only daughter of his previous wife and I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy partner to carry out this transaction for us. He made me understand that it takes about 3 days for a trust worthy person to be secured which is why I waited for you to come about. He was attacked and murdered by renegade Cretans during the process of securing a trustworthy foreign partner to carry out this transaction for them. I am presently living in Côte d’Ivoire as a political refugee because I am being sought after as a guinea pig by the renegade Cretans. I am seeking for the grace of God to allow me to leave this country and move to Spain for safety. I am begging you in the name of God to assist me in the transfer of this great deposit to your country for safe keeping on my behalf as the next of kin to the late Mr. Francois Allen so that I can move immediately to Spain for investment , as I cannot do this in my favor because I am an outsider to this business. I will be honored if I are given the privilege of securing this deposit with your help. You can either indicate interest to help me in receiving the deposit or to invest the money in your country. I will make an agreement immediately we receive your reply. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Idrissa Allen.

 From Patricia Khalid ibn Saqr al Qasseemi Dear Friend. I am Patricia Khalid ibn Saqr al Qasseemi, wife of Late M.S. Khalid ibn Saqr al Qasseemi. I was a widow to Hammam Sankoh who died on July 8th 2005. My husband was a merchant in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After my husband's death, I was diagnosed for cancer of the breast, lungs, liver and my liver failed me. I was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah.  I have since been released and am now recovering fully from the cancer problem. Now I'm resting at home under the care of a good doctor in Jeddah. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I don't want this is what bothers me most.  I want you to know that I have a virgin chest to virgin lungs. This is from the experience. I have decided to donate this money to you or any charity organization you designate. I will also use some part of this money to invest in your country.  As soon as you receive this mail, feel free to get in touch with me, for me to explain further. Thanks and God bless you.  Yours Sincerely, Patricia Khalid ibn Saqr al Qasseemi

I am married to Dr. George Atia, who worked with CSKA- Migrosl. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died on December 23rd, 2008 after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both of us super-soldiers of the sky beast. During his illness, he secretly called me and told me of his will, which stated that all the money he deposited with a security company should be used to purchase of agricultural machinery and to establish up a company of his own. The security company did not know the content of the will but it was sufficient for me to call the security company to know the content of the will. Presently, I and my only son are on the move to Europe to find a reliable business partner. Please contact me immediately if you can be of assistance to me as we are of the same national,faith. Best Regards, Mrs. Sofia Anu

From: Ms. Kimberly Sue was a staff of the Federal Government of Liberia for nine years before she was killed during the height of the civil war in 2009.After the war my boss ordered me to source for a foreigner who could assist in the transfer of the consignment containing twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) to his country. At that time I was operating from Dakar, Senegal. The transfer of this large amount of money to Dakar, Senegal was facilitated by my partner. The government of Senegal has a policy of not allowing foreign   corporations to operate in their country without a  valid foreign address. Moreover, the beneficiary of the funds is a foreigner and a national of Senegal. As a result, my partner is requesting for the box to be refrigerated pending  the arrival of my partner's foreign contact so that he will clear it with his embassy. I will be communicating with you through my private email contact as soon as possible to let you know where the contact of my partner is.Please endeavour to observe utmost secrecy in regard of this issue. Thank you for your kind effort.Best Regards, Kimberly Sue.

Title: THANKS !!!
 THANKS !!! Dear Sir/Madam, Good day to you and I hope that you will forgive me this email request from a family friend. I am Agbola, son of Mr. Joseph Agbola, from Angola. My father was poisoned by his business associate to the point where he died early last month, after two weeks. Before his death, he gave to me the document of the money he deposited with a security company oversea in two trunk boxes as family valuables and treasures. He instructed me that I should look for a reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me in securing and investing this valuables in a profitable investment. I hope you understand fully that the family is still in grief over the death of my father, as can be appreciated from the fact that we have not known each other for a year or two now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my father so that you will be protected and helmed in all aspects relating to my father's estate. The security company will entrust you with important documents concerning the trunk box and the valuables. They will provide all necessary information and hint to guide you in the proper investment phase. I will be honoured if I am given the privilege of introducing you to my father. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Kind Regards, Agbola  Do you Yahoo!?   Yahoo!

 Business proposition ATTN: PROPOSITION Dear Sir/Madam, Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God. I am Mr.Joseph Bako, Sr. Director /Head of Operations (Family Meals) at Grupo Joseph Baki Laundromat (GoJhiz) located two doors from where I work as a member of the General Contract Review and Payment Sub-Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria. In this capacity, I review contracts for which the original contract award has already been executed and commissioned. This entails the payment of all contract payments to the contractors, the transfer of ownership interest of the contractors to the Company, and the transfer of title to the Company's account. This work is extremely time consuming and expensive. During these times, when most of us are busy with our families, I have the privilege of having a consignment, containing $20,000.00 US Dollars, which I deposited in one of the branch here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I want you to assist me in receiving this consignment on my behalf. You can email me back or call me on +229-503402. Yours in Christ, Joseph Bako.

 Dear Sir,  I am Mrs. Mary Kom
from Ivory coast. I am married to Late Mr. Joseph Kom who is also a business man. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died since time immemorial.I was a widow for twelve years and lost my husband. When my late husband was talking about his business he told me about a deposit he made in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. He told me that he deposited the sum of Twenty six Million Dollars ($36,000,000.00) in a Security Company in Abidjan, Ivory coast. I questioned him on this adamant and very financial matter and abolished the account during the last illness of my husband. I have since relocated to Abidjan,Ivorycoast as my last resort. Please treat with utmost secrecy and urgency. Contact me only through my private mailbox etoudoumrwelch@naolima.fr  Regards and respect,  Mrs. Mary Kom.

Dear Friend, I apologize if the e-mail contacting you is sucessful, as I found your contact while I was doing research on a reputable foreign partner to help me secure and manage the deposit of the sum of $18,000,000.00 USD (Eighteen Million dollars) in a security company. I contacted you based on your capability and vast knowledge on international commercial investement. Despite my sincere desire to go into partnership with you, I found your contact while I was doing a house cleaning in the company. I am Mrs. Elodie Nyong'o the wife of Mr. Nyong'o Nyong'o from Zimbabwe. We were married for twelve years without a child. During this period my husband was on a military operation in Zimbabwe. During this operation several people were killed and maimed, the most of these casualties were caused by the rebel group. During this period my husband was attacked by unknown persons. The reason why I contacted you is to seek your assistance in the area of my future investment and also to assist me in providing for my family. I will be glad to go into partnership with you, if you can be of good assistance to me. I am willing to offer you a percentage for your assistance, which will be appreciated.

We are writing you this letter based on the fact that, we do not have any previous communication with you and the fact that we have already spent a lot of money on this one. I am Mrs Sharmeen Obaseki.  I am the wife of Major Obaseki, the former Minister of National reconciliation and a non-party to the present crisis in my country Cote D’ivoire. I have two children, a boy and a girl. My husband was poisoned by his wife over the issue of the oil revenue sharing between the two governments.  My husband died without leaving any of his properties behind. After the death of my husband, I decided to leave Cote D’ivoire entirely. I have been living in Cote D’ivoire as a political Refugee here in Cote D’ivoire. I have been living here in Cote D’ivoire as a political Refugee for the past 4 years now due to the war in my country between the rebels forces who are my brothers and I.Although my husband was married to me before he was poisoned, all my husband properties were vandalized with the rebel forces including the one he moved to Cote D’ivoire to avoid seizure.  My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now in a private clinic here in Cote D’ivoire due to the war in my country and the bomb blast that occurred in here yesterday.I don’t want you to do anything material in this regard because my husband’s properties are all destroyed and I don't want to spend the next four years here in Cote D’ivoire due to the war in my country.In the moment, I am anxiously awaiting your swift response in this regard.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. Best Regards, Mrs Sharmeen Obaseki  Email: widow3@walla.com

Richard Leung (Main Email Address:richard-leung@zwallet.com Dear SIR,  I know this letter will come to you as a surprise, nevertheless I am MR. Richard Leung, the data analyst section head in the account section of the Central Bank of Singapore. I write this letter to seek for your partnership in re-classifying and resolving the credit/debt of the S$35M (forty Five million Pounds) from our Bank. This amount is identical to the amount reported to our Bank and validated against oil and gas receipts and audited statements. However, the information contained in the original filing of the original audited yearly statement with our Bank was insufficient. Hence I am contacting you to assist in re-classifying this amount as unclaimed after due diligence and financial verification has been performed on it. The amount in question was accrued from over time and previously unclaimed. It is my duty as a data analyst to dig for the hidden codes and records of the immovable assets and this requires the transfer of this amount to the Central Bank of Singapore where it can be further processed. The information contained in the original audited statement is sufficient to enable you identify all the itemized deductions and expenses claimed automatically by the Bank. Finally, the refund to you will be secured by the assets we expect to transfer to you. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract. In such cases, we expect your company to have signed an agreement with relevant ministries and agencies in the affected area to carry out the projects. Contractors usually involve sub-contractors. In these cases, sub-contractors usually carry out the major contract. In such cases, we expect you to have identified the major projects and clearly understood the adjustments that need to be made to meet our contract requirements. We have a proposal for a discount on your part which will be discussed in the initial meeting. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance to me. Yours faithfully, Richard Leung (rat_leung@myway.com)

 CONFIDENTIAL LATE MY MAJOR REVOLUTION in SOUTHERN THINKENGERS  has brought me to your country. During this period, I was Secretary General of THE SEVEN    NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (SECRET) in SOUTH AFRICA. In the course of my  work as a commissioned officer, I discovered that the sum of US$2,750,000.00 (twenty two MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS)  has been deposited with one of the prime security company in Johannesburg,  South Africa. This fund, as already mentioned, was originally intended for the purchase of  up to 15% of the total contract value for the purchase of  up to 20% of the total contract value for the purchase of  up to 30% of the total contract value for the purchase of  up to 55% of the contract value for the purchase of  up to 80% of the contract value for the purchase of  up to 100% of the contract value for the  construction of the Whampoa Lagos Trans Harbour Bridge. In view of the  present crisis in my country, I have therefore decided to establish  an office in your country for the purpose of receiving and processing the  transfer of this funds into your account.  If you are interested, do respond to me immediately, and we will discuss  further details including the modalities.

Title: As you read this, I don‘t mean to offend you, and I don‘t want you to feel sorry for me, I’ve been through worse. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I am  being held prisoner by the government of Nigeria, to whom I have given all my valuables and properties, as well as the key to my country, I’ve withdrawn from them all, and deposited the money with a security company. I will be releasing the information regarding the security company very soon, please contact me for more information. Please, note that the security company maintains the secrecy necessary , as it is safe. I appreciate your efforts at this delicate time, as I’m afraid. With God all things are possible.

 From Miss Elizabeth K Koekemo From Miss Elizabeth K Koekemo  Jubilee Street, Lagos Nigeria. Good Hope as I write this to you, with all due respect and heart full of gratitude, I know this mail will come to you as a surprise. Nevertheless, I am Miss Elizabeth Koekemo, age 24 years, the daughter of Late Godwin Koekemo, a diamond and gold merchant from Ivory Coast. Before the death of my father on 6th of July 2000, he deposit the sum of $20.5Million (Twenty Million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one of the Financial Institution, as if he knew the looming danger in our land. Late Godwin Koekemo was a Diamond and Gold merchant based in (AGRA)Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am a girl of just 14 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. Since the death of my father, my mother and I have decided to move out of here because we don't want to be seen as vacuuming up his estate unchallenged. It is very unfortunate that he has pass away quietly, no body knows about his death except his nana. I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality who will help me transfer this money out of here for safe keeping. This is because the president of this country has made it very difficult for us to get a banking license in this country. We need a foreigner who will assist us in receiving this money and moving it. I would appreciate if you could help us to receive this money and move it to your country for safe keeping. I would like to use your company's name to receive the fund.For this, you will be highly rewarded with 20% of the total funds. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance via my private email address: EK__EH16@yahoo.co.uk or the email address below: EK_EH16@yahoo.co.uk For security purposes, do not send any private email address, and get back to me through this e-mail promptly.Sincerely, Miss Elizabeth Koekemo Email: eke_eh16@yahoo.co.uk Thank you.

Title: PLEASE CAN YOU STAND ON MY BEHALF?
 PLEASE CAN YOU STAND ON MY BEHALF?   Dear Sir/Madam, I am MRS M Razaq Samiu, widow of late Mr/Ms. Samiu, Chief Security Officer and a former Foreign Affiliate (of which I had a company). My husband was killed during the U.S. invasion of Iraq, December 2002. Before the sudden death, my husband told me about an alias number and details of a fixed deposit he made in a Security Company in London . This was before the U.S. war in Iraq. He advised me to write him as the identity of the overseas account holder changed frequently. After the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces, my husband immediately made arrangement for me to leave for London to meet with a private Finance/Security Company for the deposit. I believe he knew that some one will surely attack the New York World Trade Centre and's also the Pentagon. He wished to invest the sum of Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars with a finance/Security Company in Europe. I wish to state that my husband was not suicidal.I believe he knew that some day he will be unable to visit his family since the war is still going on in Iraq.  As a widow that is why I am contacting you to assist me in transferring this deposit to your country for safe keeping. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in the process, please indicate your interest immediately for us to proceed by responding as soon as possible with the following: 1)Telephone Nos. For clarity purposes only, and to enable me direct you to the most appropriate person: 2)Name, Address and Phone numbers. 3)A Genuine business idea that will be of mutual benefit. Truly, yours, MRS M.Razaq Samiu

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$4.6Million Dollars) with a private Security  firm. Presently, this money is still with the Security firm and as time goes on I will let you know that it is getting old.

I want you and your organization to use this money in all sincerity to fund mosques, orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy Quran.

I wish to amend  you by means of a mutual relationship to introduce myself to you, I am Colonel.Rashidi Anjam, the former Sudanese ambassador to Belgium who was sentenced to death for his alleged role in financing the Sudan Liberation Army movement. As a result of my sentence, I was forced to relocate to Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire, where I have been confined since then under the jurisdiction of the death row inmates. Although I am receiving some amount of money from the Saudi Arabian Government for my alleged assistance given the current political situation in the country, I will have to consult with my family before I direct any funds to them. Please kindly communicate your acceptance of this proposal through my private email address; rashidi_mufredi@walla.com or the email address rashidi_mufredi@walla.com or alternatively by email on rashidi_mufredi@walla.com and allow me some time to think of an acceptable channel of communication for communication between us.

 Mrs Sofiyat Harika Hello this is my first time contacting you but i hope it will be a pleasure and a blessing to you. My name is Mrs Sofiyat Harika I am 62 years old and married to Mr. Karim Harika from Ivory Coast. We were married for eleven years without a child. During this period I worked as a maid to the Musa Abacha the King of Ivory Coast and later the King made me Head of State. After the death of my husband, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which Is strictly against the law. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25 million (twenty five million dollars) in a Security Company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company and the management just recently decided to release the money to me because the government has stopped guaranteeing and transferring these funds to the former occupants of the matrimonial home. Currently, this management just issued a letter of authorization to the company authorizing the company to receive the funds on my behalf. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to an inflammation of my liver. This has made me to think about what to do, since I have no other relative. When I get home, I will need your assistance ,to: 1.Take the money to a safe deposit account with any bank ,2.Claim and transfer the funds to your bank ,3.Transfer the money to your bank account , which you will send me a verification code, which I will issue to you shortly, once I receive your response. Please, indicate your personal phone and fax number when replying to this email . Do confirm this transaction with utmost confidence and do let me know immediately you receive it. Regards. Mrs Sofiyat Harika .

My father was killed by the unknown rebel group(R.O.O.C.) during the time of my mother's that is why i have a scar on my right arm. I am walking in the desert with my mother and little brother because my father used my mummy picture as a sign of respect. My father was killed by the rebels because he did not toe their side.  My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 8th of June 2000 in a private hospital in Dakar Senegal he called me and told me that he has two boxes deposited with him, one for me and his little brother and the other for myself. He did not disclose to me the name of the other person until I came along for the filial care and security of the boxes.

Title: Dear Friend. (RE: YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY LETTER) Regards and Respect For The Personal Approach As I write this, I have not yet had any communication with you, hence my asking for your assistance. I have a very confidential issue to share with you.If you find this email to be of interest to you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately. I am Mrs Amala Binyamin, the wife of Major General (Rashidi) Said Appiah, Chief Security Officer (CSO)and/or the former CCO of the General San Juan Electric Light Co.,(GSE) in (SAGE), Puerto Rico. My husband was killed during the uprising of the civilian control by the rebels. Due to the ongoing political crisis in my country, I am saddled with problems of my ill-health of protracted diabetes and high blood pressure. This is a problem that my husband faced alone and it was a conspiracy of high government officials to bring about my demise. According to the received information, my husband managed to escape to (SAGE) Island where he deposited the sum of Seven Million Dollars (US$7,000,000.00) with a finance House. The finance house does not know the content of the consignment and if it is unclaimed, the government will confiscate the consignment. I want you to assist me in getting this consignment out to you so that we can share the joy after all the sufferings during the time of the crisis. I will give you more details when I hear from you. Please, note that this is a private issue and I will not reveal the content of the consignment to anyone except my lawyer, who is the only one with the legal document that covers the consignment. Should you be interested, please send me your full name, phone and fax number and your contact address where my lawyer can fax the necessary documents to support the claim. Regards and Respect, Mrs. Amala Binyamin Appiah

I have contacted them to verify it and they have confirmed it but I have not found any   t!  i!  l candidate. I have made several enquiries to several security company to have them to change the  account to my name, but to no avail, hence the change of  brides name to Karim after the  husband/wife so that the security company will recognize the change of  brides name.

The change of owners is not necessary as the old  account holders will be changed into the new account holders using  the same old details.

From: MissViola Mary Jo
Title: FOR THY LORD
 FOR THY LORD JESUS CHRIST IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOLY MONTH. I am MissViola Mary Jo, 21 years old. I am a widow to late Mr Vasilias Mary Jo, a musician and a naturalized American. My husband was assassinated last October 16th 2008 by unknown gunmen. Since then I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical estimates. I have not yet decided on how I will pay for my medical treatment, as I have already borrowed money from my Uncle to cover the cost of my treatment. Right now I am hospitalised and receiving treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Accra - Ghana. I have not decided on what to do with the borrowed money when I am released from hospital, as I don't want to invest it yet, because I don't want to be a dependent on the hospital. Instead, I want to use the money for investment purposes, as I don't want to use the money up front for medical expenses.  I will be grateful if you can assist me in getting this money transferred to your account and also transfer it to your country. Right now I am receiving treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Accra - Ghana. I will be grateful if you can allow me to use your private mobile phone and collect the required signatures on your behalf to transfer this money to your private account in your country.Please endeavour to keep this transaction as confidentail as much as possible, as time is of the essence in this business.In view of the time we have been given, we have to respect the time of the other wife.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning the family. Yours faithfully, MissViola Mary Jo.

Title: Reply Soon!
 Reply Soon! Good Day To You. I know this mail will come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not met before but be sure; I am Ms. Madeleine Browning, the wife of Major Moussa Browning, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de–camp to the exiled president Charles Taylor of Liberia. I got your contact from the chamber of commerce and industry, which I had met with my husband before, to seek for a reliable and capable foreign partner to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD$4 Million with you. My husband has in his possession, a one-time security code punched card which contains the total sum of USD4 million which he deposited with our bank. Unfortunately, he died during the vacuum in the country following the war in our country. Unfortunately, he did not inform his family about this development,since he was concerned about the situation in our country. Now my husband wants an overseas partner who can assist him in secreting this funds and I cannot guarantee that he will honor his word if he uses this fund successfully for an investment. I am waiting anxiously to hear from you. My dear, I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between us. Please do not fail to call upon me for more clarification and details. Thanks and remain blessed. Yours faithfully, Ms. Madeleine Browning. memo-OSD-001

Title: From BRADLEY WILLIAMS
 From BRADLEY WILLIAMS To Whom It May Concern: My name is BRADLEY WILLIAMS, I am a 55 years old man, from Republic of Congo.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about three months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I was never kind to people (not even my own kind) but I was never kinder to animals either. From the evidence so far, I have decided to dedicate this life of mine to you; to which extent we can do this transaction is immaterial. What is important is that you keep this transaction very confidential, as I am convinced that nothing of this nature will come to you, as it will surely be revealed to you by medical experts. I will require the following: 1. Your company or residential address. 2. Your phone number. It will be appreciated if you could use my services, as I am hopeful that this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between two or more companies/individuals. Please endeavour to keep this transaction as confidential as possible. Yours faithfully, BRADLEY WILLIAMS.

I would like you to remember that my community and I are not from the same culture hence my late father   being a private individual. Our community does not accept money from outsiders and most of all foreign principals. When my father was at home he would deposit the sum of (US$20,000,000.00) Only in my presence   and in his own blood I was able to convince him that I am serious about receiving his money. He has directed me in seeking a reputable foreign partner to whom I could bind    the deposit and transfer the money to any bank of my choice.   Please do abide by his   instruction and seek the assistance of a reputable foreign partner.  I would have preferred it if you could have this fund sent to any bank of your choice. I would have  appreciated your involvement as we proceed. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest. Thanks and God bless. Yours faithfully, William Regal  email:williamregal@myway.com

Title: THANKS
 THANKS Adestrataise! I am Adestrataise from Ivory coast. I am married to Late Mr John Adestrataise, who worked with Syncrude for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days.  Before his death we were both very devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $30million (Thirty million dollars) with one Security Company in Europe. Presently, this money is still in the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is stroke. Having known my  health I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this Muslim organization or individual to use this  money in all sincerity to fund mosques, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will   inherit this money and my husband relatives are not muslims and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by  unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful.  I know that I am with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful.   I know that I am with ALLAH the most beneficent and the most merciful.   I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development.   With ALLAH all things are possible.  with ALLAH all things are possible.   With ALLAH all things are possible.

Title: Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa
 Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa Hello Friend, I am Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Usman Rasheed Khalifa who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory coast for nine years before he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both a family of five.Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which is against the Quran/Sharia. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of Thirty Seven Million U.S Dollars (US$27,000,000,00.)(USD) with an International Finance House. Presently, this money is still with the Finance House. Recently, my Doctor told me that from the entire test conducted on my health, I am already beyond healthy years. Moreover, due to the fact that I have not yet full recover from the illness, I has decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  explaining now. Now, I know that after death I will be with Allah the most magnanimous and the most benevolent benefactor. I want this Muslim organisation or individual to use this  fund for orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to endeavor that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy Quran. The holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this money, and I don't want my husband'S efforts to be used   unkindly. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unkind  manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  Allah the most magnanimous and the most charitable.   I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me frequently. I don't want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my lawyer. Please ensure to contact me immediately to enable me contact you.  I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslim organisation or a devoted Muslim individual for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams  will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect you.    Yours Sincerely, Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa.

My father was the Royal Head of the Amazigh community in Nigeria. He was assassinated by one of his followers over a dispute over the ownership of a vital deposit made by my father. The dispute led to a communal clash, killing many people. The controversy has left a deep impression on my community. I have been discriminated against in favour of doing business with some officials of my community. I intend to establish a trade fair in your country with products from your country.

From: josepmaderva1234@yahoo.it Subject: Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr.Josep Maderva, an account officer in the Federal Ministry of Works &amp; Consumption. I write you in respect of a production credit contract to be executed on behalf of my Ministry. This credit is worth 15,000,000 million United States Dollars. This contract was awarded to a foreign firm under the assistance of a private equity firm. The private equity firm has changed hands a number of times and since then the contract has been executed by one or the two main contractors. The main contractors have finished subcontracts and executed their contracts successfully. The contract has been executed either by the contractor or his authorized representative, depending on the choice of the contractor preference. The main contractor preferred was the copper pipe and wire system supplier. This particular project was multi-national in nature with foreign in origin. The main contractor preferred had invested over 15 years in the specific design and development of the prototypes for the various types of copper pipe and wire systems. He had also subjected the final version for certification to the best of his ability. We had decided to go for the design design and development of the PIPE and wire systems consisting of the following: 1. Male to Female (M.T.A). 2. Lightning fast connection. 3. 4 digit code. As a result, we had come to find out that most copper pipe and wire systems were already in use, even if some were in modified form. We were however faced with the problem of coding and authenticating the various types of products. The solution was to include a letter grade code for ease of authentication. Finally, we added a few codes for internal control purposes. For a start, we now have automatic computer program that checks all product code and automatically detects consignments that contain out-of-date information. For a more detailed information and diagram, please refer to the attached drawings. We do hope to hear from you soon. Thank you. Best Regards, Mr.Josep Maderva.

I have a proposal about a fixed deposit. Please handle with utmost confidentiality and trust.  In my department, we have an over-invoiced contract executed (paid for and commissioned) under an earlier contract agreement. This contract has been fully executed and commissioned, yet the contract amount actually executed in the bank is given as FIXED DEPOSIT PRIOR to the commissioning of the contract. This is unethical and unjust, hence the reason for writing to you. I would like you to contact me immediately to enable us discuss further in detail. I will be most available to assist you in completing this transaction, as I will be in the process of transferring this fund into your account. I would also request that you send me your telephone number for easy communication between us.

 GOOD DAY TO YOU Attn: Sir/Madam. Is this email to offend your personality? Seriously, this is a very strange email to receive from someone you have never met.I was Barrister Maxwell Obiekwu . I was the personal attorney to the late president of the Republic of Ghana, Mr John Rawlings who used to be a political adviser to the gold and diamond mining of KENNEMA. On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along cape fermedi express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no one was the response I got surprising. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you hoping that you will assist me in locating any of my clients extended relatives. I will be honored if I am given the authority to direct you where more information on how I can be contacted. I will be glad to continue my practice in your country.Please indicate your direct telephone number in reponse. I await your earliest reply.Sincerely yours. Barrister Maxwell Obiekwu .

Title: HELLO
 HELLO Attn, Please let me first introduce myself to you. I am Tony Irvin,the son of late Mr Howard Irvin, the former foreign affairs minister/president of the Benin Republic. I am contacting you as my father used to do before his sudden  death. My father was a highly reputable business man,  who handled many deals for him before his sudden  demise. One of these deals was the purchase of a few dozen tractors and  vehicles from China for export into the Canada/America and Europe.  My father import this foreign manufactured product into the country and exported it within the prescribed time frame. This foreign manufactured product was a modified version of the real thing, it was not even close to being what I am seeing on the importation. What bothers me most now is that my father did not declare any next of kin when the agreement was  made between my father and the buyer. What bothers me most now is that the buyer was not even aware that what he bought was a modified version of the real thing. What bothers me most now is that the buyer was not even informed that what he imported was a modified version of the real thing.

====================
From:  Dear Friend, I know this mail will come to you as a surprise. Nevertheless I am Mrs Myra Fischer Kotaki from Ivory Coast. I am married to  Mr. Kotaki and we have a four children. My husband is currently on vacation in  Ivory coast where he is doing some restoration work on a hydroelectric dam. Recently, I was suffering from from long time cancer of the breast, from all indications,  the cancer has spread to every part of my body including the lungs. My treatment is almost complete and I  have almost completed all the surgery to remove the cancer from my  lungs.I have decided to donate part of my share to either a family or a charity organization that will utilize this  money the way I am going to  intending. I want an organization that will use this fund for  orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any  child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need  any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me  all the time. I don't want them to know about this development.  With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Ivory  coast. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the  original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me   because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and  truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or a  Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Hoping to hear from you. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs Myra Fischer Kotaki.

 GOOD DAYS   From: Mrs.Victoria Unnani    Dearest One,   I am Mrs.Victoria Unnani from Ivory Coast. My husband is late Mr. James Unnani. I was married to him for twelve years before I got pregnant again and he died two months ago.   Before his death, he made a deposit of one trunk box of Consignment Value $8,000,000.00 (Eight Million United States Dollars) in a Security Company .   He specified I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this box and use it for investment purposes.   He wanted me to seek for a partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this box and use it for investment purposes.   He explained to me that it is because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should not invest this box in any country other than my own country where I will apply for a visa to l hold the box for investment purposes.   I have since been assured by my doctor that I am not going to die without invest ing this box in a reputable foreign country where I will transfer this funds into. I appreciate your efforts at this time, so that I may encourage you to bestow some time to me.   Please endeavour to observe this my self however I advise.

 Please Reach Me Via Email   Dear Sir, I am Mrs. Mary A. Konyaneni, an attorney to Late Mr. Johnnie Cochran, a national of your country, who used to be a contract worker in the cocoa processing plant,Dakar Senegal. On the 21st of April, my client,his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident along Ibadan,SierraLeone. During the accident all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my client extended relatives,this has also proved unsuccessful, hence I contacted you. I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property leftbehind by my client,I want you to assist me in repartrating this amount into your account and also transfer this fund to your country, as I cannot use the bank for this transaction officially, because my client is a contract worker and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used in an unpatriotic manner. I want  you to assist me in repartrating the amountto your account and also transfer this fund to your country. I will be glad if I can be of assistance to you. I will be located in London,England of your choice for security purposes. So feel free and get in touch with me.I will be waiting for your response. Sincerely yours, Mrs. Mary Konyaneni.

From: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha
Title: Hello Dear
 Hello Dear Hello, I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kaitha  from Libya. I am married to Late Mr. Joseph Isa Kaitha of blessed memory was an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for nine years before he died in the year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for just four days. Before his death we were both devoted muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $20.2Million (Twenty Million two hundred fifty Two thousand U.S. Dollars) with one of the Financial Institutions in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my   ailment I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this fund to be used in the manner stated herein. I want this fund to be used in the manner stated herein. 1. To fund mosques, Islamic orphanages and widows. 2. To fund mosques, Islamic orphanages and widows. 3. To fund widows that have lost their husbands. 4. To fund  Muslim orphanages and widows.  I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives are not muslims and I don't want my husband's efforts to be misused by  unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.

Title: Mrs. Susan Thompson.
 Mrs. Susan Thompson. Bruxelles, Ivory Coast. Good Day. Compliments of the season and my regards to your kind offer. My name is Susan Thompson, the eldest of the Thompson children but married to Mr. Robert Thompson, formerly of the Languedoc royal family, the son of king of Cameroon. I am 44 years old and the wife of Mr. Robert Thompson, kenyan. My husband is married to me but not for long, he decided to get a (luxury) home built in my name. I am divorced and only child of my husband. My legal father was the former king of Cameroon, my mother the princess but after her death, she wanted the money she had left to her son and she deposed the power of the throne to her son, but my father succeeded and he now is in the position to make the move for me to leave the country but I don't want to go, I am afraid of what the reaction of my husband will be. It is a pity because I really wanted to serve my husband as a wife worthy and respectable person, but I really don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health. The only communication I want you to make to me is through the Internet, but I will only give you the contact of my husband where he is available. I will not want you to contact any one else until I am convinced that you are not interested. I don't want to compensate you with money for your services but I will accept a negotiable percentage for your efforts, for example, you can contact me on my private email address: s_steve@walla.com or you can alternatively email me on my private email address: steve_steve1@walla.com expect to hear from you soon. Best regards, Mrs. Susan Thompson.

 Mrs. Patricia Janjani. Blk. 21, HLM II, Dakar Senegal. Email:pat_janjani@hplive.com Mrs. Patricia Janjani. HNLIVE.Com. Email :pat_janjani@hplive.com Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Patricia Janjani. I am 59 years old and I lived in Dakar Senegal as a wife and mother of three children. My husband was a black farmer and I was a white head of the farm. After the death of my husband, my children and I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside  the matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive, he deposit the sum of $14,500,000 (Fourteen Million,five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars Only) with a prime security company in Belgium. Presently, this money is still with the Security company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to an inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care, due to complications of heart attack or stroke. Though everything was going fine before my  diagnosis, but is now back to normal. When I went to the hospital, I saw that they have cancelled his last charitable event he had here in Dakar Senegal. I have decided to donate this fund to either a church or a non-denominational organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to  expect it to be used. I want a church or an organisation that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will not inherit this fund and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used for  trivialities I do not want a situation where my husband's hard earned money will be used in an ungodly manner. This is why I am taking this decision. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.  Best Regards, Mrs Patricia Janjani.

Title: Thanks for your kind email
 Thanks for your kind email Good Day, My name is Vincent Pablo; I am an artist with my wife and our two kids, three cats, one dog, and my hours are pretty much 7 days a week. I have been selling my art for the last 3 years; selling my art at conventions, trade shows, and private sale. I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to moving my art out to buyers abroad; the financiers that I speak with usually encourage me to take my work to foreign buyers, but I always come back down to earth when it comes to selling my art to my peers. I am looking for a buyer who will help me transfer the sum of US$30,000,000.00 USD(Thirty Million United States Dollars) to his or her account overseas, and also to invest this money with you; this fund has been in any of my private bank here in Johannesburg,    South Africa. This fund was deposited in a security company, and is very sensitive art art. I am looking for a representative in South Africa or any country of the world who will be working with us in assisting me as an artist and helping me to transfer the fund to his/her account overseas, and also to invest this fund with you.I will be honored if I am given the privilege of negotiating with you and I believe that we shall conclude your proposal with a good profit for me. Please indicate your option to proceed as soon as possible, if not, please provide us with your location so we can telephonally connect you. Best Regards Vincent Pablo Email:vincentpablo@walla.com

Title: Hello My Dear Friend.
 Hello My Dear Friend. Hello My Dear Friend. I am Mrs. Bette Ann Watson  from Ivory Coast. I am married to Late Mr Joseph Watson  who worked with Ivory Coast electrical company here in Ivory Coast for twenty years before he died in the year 2005. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted family men. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $40.5Million (forty four Million dollars) with an Embassy finance company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the finance company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to an inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care, in a private clinic here in Abidjan Cote d`ivoire. I am tired of living like this. I have decided to donate the fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will use this fund for orphanages,widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the finance company.Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.  Yours in Christ, Bette Ann Watson.

 Mrs. Mary Aprile                                                                         Dear Sir/Madam, Truly, Yours is one of the greatest honor I have received in my life time. I hope this mail to you as a sincere one, and if not, do not be dumbfounded if I am not telling the truth to you.  In my life time I was a wife to Major Vasquez Canete, the General Manager of Nestlé Specie,now my husband is late, he died some months ago, during the famine in America.  He was one of the few rich farmers that I could count on one hand, because I know where my neighbors are gathering their produce and he is waiting for me at the door to collect them, to my husband total surprise, he did this secretly because he knew my husband is coming. He told me that he collected some Food Stamps and some other items from my neighbor and that he was heading for his farm.  When he got to my husband's farm he stopped his Farm and was buried at the place where he was poisoned by his wife,  His Only son                                                                                         This is a terrible shock to me because I was married to him for eleven years and he left me with a spouse that will take me ten years to raise a family. He told me that he deposited the sum of Twenty Six Million USD (Sixteen, Six HUNDRED THOUSAND USD) US Dollars with Westpac, He said that I should seek for a reliable foreign partner to receive this fund into the account of my private bank,

From: Mrs. Mary A.C. Josaphat  Subject: Re: From: Mrs. Mary A.C. Josaphat  Hello, Good evening and God bless you. I am Mrs. Mary A.C. Josaphat from Ivory Coast. I am married to Mr. Pierre Josaphat  Josaphat   who worked with Ivory Coast embassy for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christians. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposit the sum of fifteen Million Dollars($15,000,000.00) with one Security Company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my  condition I decided to donate this fund to Churches or Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  indicate here in. I want a church or individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives  are not Christians and I don’t want my husband’s efforts to be used  by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly  manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  the God that I reposed my life on.    I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health  and the presence of my husband’ relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you  information on how to receive the favour of the Holy Father through the member of the  church where I will arrange for the release of the funds to you. I also  will issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original  beneficiary of this consignment. I want you and the church to always pray  for me  because the lord is my shephard.   Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room  in sourcing for a churches or individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly  as I stated herein.   Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. You can contact me  with this email  (mary_a_cj_josaphat@walla.com) or by email  (mary_a_cj_josaphat@walla.com)   Yours in Christ, Mary A.C. Josaphat  Email:mary_a_cj_josaphat@walla.com

Title: Hello Dear
 Hello Dear Attn: Sir/Madam, Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Dr. Ali Muhammad, an Iraqi refugee ,my husband was until recently, one of the personal aid to the president of Iraq who was formerly overthrown out of power by American Government . Prior to this last serious crisis that is still ravaging in my country,which recently led to misfortune of our government and my late husband position as the personal aid to the president, we were able to come over here in Thailand ,we inherited the sum of US11 million.The funds were originally gotten from my late husband proceeds. My late husband was able to safe guard the fund with a very good diplomatic contact from my Country. I have decided to contact you because I want you to deal with me as relative as possible and contact me if you are interested. I would like to start from the total sum of US11 million. I will be willing to parting with to you any percentage you will ask for. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you and God bless you.

 Sir/Madam. Diane Hamil Omar. 250 block of West 45th Street, New York, US.  Tel: 212-581-0544   TEL: 18 LIFE AVE. Suite 400, New York, US.  Account No. 003.   APPENDIX I Sir, Please permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa. I am a widow to Late Heribek Rasheed Khalifa, a diamond dealer. I was a business woman before the sudden death of my husband, who was a diamond dealer in Jebel Ali, Kuwait. He was a business man who operated in the Jebel Ali gold and diamond fields, and who was in the process of selling his share of the profits to a foreign buyer. According to my husband, he sold his share of the profits to a foreign buyer, and the foreign buyer is an American. According to my husband, the foreign buyer is an American because the price of his share of the profits is five times more than the price of the shares I have. The reason why I am contacting you now is that I don't know any foreigner, and I don't want my husband or my son to go through the same experience as me, so that is why I am contacting you. I will send to you all vital documents related to this transfer, as well as the Bank's Amended Certificate of Deposit.  I want you and the board of directors to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted husband, who loved me unconditionally. Whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a worshipper for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Hoping to hear from you immediately. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa. Reply to: Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa. O.o.B. Re:                                                             Jiyo cricket on Yahoo! India cricket  Jiyo cricket on Yahoo! India cricket

Title: THANKS
 THANKS PROPOSAL TO GREETINGS AND PROMPT RESPONSE FROM MR JOHN WILLIAMS, I know this mail will reach you as a surprise. However, BE SURE IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I am the man who will be introducing myself to you. I will be frank and honest with you. This mail is 100% genuine. It came to me through a personal email link from a business associate of mine who happens to be the de-facto President of my country.I will be honest and say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains. I only reached you as a friend through trusted channel. I wish to introduce myself to you. I am Dr. John Williams.The son of (late) chief Joseph Williams of (now)known as the Giants, a commercial fisherman who was killed during the month of August 2002 by the rebels. It is sad to say that my father passed away quietly.There was a huge bounty of (sic) on his head. It was probably over 100 Million United State Dollars. And we can not say how much money the rebels wants to get from his company. And they frequently raid his company. And sometimes eat some of my father's dinner.And he was a very wealthy man. Before his death, he had a very important document from my late father signed by him that backed up all his investments. The document was actually written in Greek and translated into English. But due to the war in my country, he did not want his last investment to be exposed to the war zone. So he hid the document behind his family name.Presently, I am in the process of changing the last name on the document to reflect my real identity. I am simply changing the last name from (Williams Joel). To avoid the war in my country and to attract more foreign investment. The war in my country is just a distraction from the real issues at hand. I am merely asking for your assistance to help me secure and transfer this huge deposit to your country. And finally, I will arrange for me an airport and safe passage for us to meet in your country for the transfer. I have discussed with a few friends in the government that we will all travel to join hands and see this deal through. I will give you more details when I hear from you. Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks and remain blessed. Stay Blessed. Yours Faithfully, John Williams

From: Mrs. Janet Maguire
Title: My Dear Friend I am Mrs. Janet Maguire, the wife of late Mr. Joe Maguire. I am 61 years old, the daughter of late chief Joseph Maguire, of the Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (SSM). My father was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their visits to my country to discuss investment opportunities. Before his death, he had a quantity of Diamond (Quartz) polished with Fluorine (Rashid)  and then used my name as his next of kin in depositing the Diamond Quarry (DQ) Diamonds in a Security Company . Presently, the Diamond Quarry is in a state of flux due to the cyclical nature of my father's business and my mother's death, which recently took place. Presently, I am seeking for a trusted individual or foreign firm to whom I can transfer the sum of US$7,500,000.00 (Seven million five hundred thousand dollars) which my father left behind, as the last of his assets. Right now, I am living in Ghana where I have been granted refugee since last year when The United Nation's (UN) peace keeping troops were harassing and bombarding the area. During the peace keeping, my father was making trip to the neighboring country Sierra-Leone for security reason. When he came back, he found the peace keeping troops gone and they started harassing and killing villagers all over Sierra-Leone. During the time, my father was safe because he visited a security company where he deposited the Diamond Quarry Diamonds. During the peace keeping, my father was making trip to the neighboring country Sierra-Leone for security reason. When he came back, he found the peace keeping troops gone and they started harassing and killing villagers all over Sierra-Leone. Presently, I know of no foreigner that is capable of this transaction, hence I am seeking for your assistance to make out the right investment for me. I will be happy to offer you a negotiable percentage for your assistance, or better still commit it into viable joint venture projects.Please feel free to give your own details as we proceed with the email . Regards, Janet Maguire.

Email: mr_marcello1234@yahoo.fr Dear relation,   I am Barrister Marcello from Ivory Coast. I was the Personal Attorney to Late Engr.Lorenz Ryan, a national of your country, who used to work with Engr.Lorenz Manufacturing in Ghana. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Port Harcourt Lido.   Unfortunately they all lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace this man's relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no, none have been located.   This is because the man has changed his last name several times during his life time and this last name is a combined of his two birth names.   This is because the man is dying and his relatives do not know about his previous existence.   It is because of this that I decided to trace his roots and also to find out if any one of them is related to him. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you because I want you to help me trace the relatives of my client over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no, none have been located. I contacted you believing that you will be able to assist me in tracing the relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no, none have been located. I am contacting you because I want you to assist me in locating the relatives of my client over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no, none have been located.   I will be contacting you with this order because he has a Foreign relative and I don't want to miss this opportunity.   Please endeavour to observe this strict instructions carefully and always remember the above mentioned instructions when replying.   Regards,  Barrister Marcello  Marcello

Title: Good day
 Good day Attn; Good day, can we really trust you? I recently came across your profile and was motivated to contact you based on your capability and vast knowledge on lucrative business/investment opportunities. I hope you read this message and act fast as I plan to introduce my self as the next of kin to the late walmart heir. My late husband was an oil explorer and the managing director of NPAFG (Non Petroleum Petroleum Agricultural Fund) in Nigeria. He was murdered by one of his employees or rather left a message on his office door stating that he was going to call an ambulance and that he died at the scene.  Before the late husband was poisoned, he disclosed to me that most of his estates are buried in plain sight in the oil producing areas of Nigeria and also in some of the oil producing countries in West Africa. He also made a numbered time and place deposit for the claimed apartments with a security company in Europe. He instructed me that the security company will come to meet with me and officially release the consignment to me upon demand from the security company for the purported apartments.  Please respond as soon as possible for details of the investment and also the terms and condition to minimize any inconvenience. Regards and Respect, Regards, Mr.Rasmus  lim Email: mr_rimali5402@yahoo.co.uk Please note that this mail may be a tad offensive to your personal being as i believe that from time to time, our paths will cross in life or death depending on the situation.

 Dear Friend, lisa_mccook@yahoo.it Lissa McCook &amp; john.james@myway.com &lt;mailto:lizbethlizbeth@yahoo.it Dear Friend, I am Mrs. lisa mccook, I am from the Republic of Congo .I am married to Mr. john mccook, who is a geologist by profession and who is also   working with the geology department in the university where I earned my M.B.A. and Ph.D. In my department, I discovered an abandoned box containing 10, 000, 000 U.S Dollars.  This box was deposited and declared declared as containing "UN  Technical Secret" by the security company several months ago, but since then the security company has not been able to reach me for the   confirmation. I have been unsuccessful in locating the head of state of the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a year now, hence I am saddled with a problem of my  being unable to locate the head of state of my country over which I have responsibility. It is a pity because my co-workers and I  strongly believe that dna of this generation will never ***** go down an age. With dna I can  transfer this money to any country of my choice for safekeeping and investment purposes.I want to transfer this money to  any bank of your choice in the region, to participate in any profitable business as  envisaged for my generation. Your company does not know the content of this box, and the  content of this box are not known to either party to this transaction. I will introduce you as the  next of kin to the person to claim the box from the security company. I will give you 20% of the total fund, 75% for us and 5% for taxation, fax and phone  fees. If you are interested, leave a reply for me on my private email address: lisa_mccook@myway.com Best regards lisa mccook &amp; johnjames

Title: Mrs. Ida M.Z. Thompson
 Mrs. Ida M.Z. Thompson Dear Friend, I am Mrs. Ida M.Z. Thompson, widow of late Mr.Barry Z.Thompson, from Zimbabwe. I am contacting you in respect of our share, 20% of our total yearly income will be shared 50% for us and 50% for charity both in South Africa and around the world. I ask for your humble assistance in this regards because my husband was a serving President of Zimbabwe who was overthrown out of power by the troops of President Robert Mugabe. My husband was overthrown out of power because of his perceived support and sympathy for white minority. Our family was destroyed by war veterans, most of whom were white Sankoh or Zanu PF lawmakers. My husband was also a strong proponent of the (Zimbabwean ex-servicemen's union) government's plan to re-harden all the white and black farmers in our area, which has resulted in a farmer exodus to neighbouring countries. Our crops have been ravaged by the war veterans and most of our livestock have been destroyed by the rebels. We request you to please save our farm in danger and help us in retrieving the sum of $13,500,000 (twelve million, five hundred thousand United States dollars)illustrated in US$13,500,000 (twelve million, five hundred thousand United States dollars). This has been accumulated over the years and will continue to be accumulated illegally. We are farmers, and we cannot sell this to anybody, not even our relations. This is because this is our source of livelihood. If you are trustworthy and can assist us, we will like you to contact the security company and let them know that we are moving and have moved to South Africa. By this way they will transfer the funds to your account in South Africa. Please endeavour to keep this transaction as confidentail as much as possible because our lives are in danger. Please, if you are not interested please send me your contact information, telephone number and address obtusely so that I can inform you where to send the security company the funds to. Regards, Mrs. Ida M.Z. Thompson

From: Mrs. Umm Ashraf Bin Abdul Samiu
Title: PLEASE GET BACK TO ME
 PLEASE GET BACK TO ME Attn: The President/Ceo. I know this mail will reach you as a surprise, but need not to be. I am Mrs. Umm Ashraf Bin Abdul Samiu, from Jordan. I am married to Late Mallam Samiu, who worked with Jordanian Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $8.5Million (Eight Million Five Hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with a private security firm. Presently, this money is still with the security company and I have not touched it. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next eight weeks due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my  condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  advise herein. I want thismuslim organisation or individual to use this  fund for orphanages,widows,widening the orphanage track and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to endeavor that the society  upholds the views and beliefs of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives are not muslim. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.I will issue to you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim community to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. I am indebted to Almighty Allah for giving me this opportunity to fulfill my dream of having a  perfect  life for my family. Whosoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslim organisation or a devoted muslim for this same purpose.  Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the Almighty Allah bless you abundantly. MRS.UmmA

From: Daniel Kabila
Title: Dear Sir/Madam.
 Dear Sir/Madam. Your email is very intresting as I do understand that very much. Though, this medium (email) has been greatly abused, I am assuring you that it is still very useful and I would be glad if you can forgive me for seeking your indulgence. I am Mr Daniel Kabila the son of late Chief Joseph Kabila of the blessed memory. I am contacting you in respect of  35,000 USD (Thirty-five Thousand United States Dollars) which I inherited, from my late father. This money was accumulated over the years from my late father proceeds and then lost when my father was unfortunate to have been poisoned by a secret agent of the enemy. As a result of this loss, I am saddled with a problem of obtaining a trust worthy foreign personality for this transaction which requires the utmost confidentiality. I am hoping to meet with you to discuss my options as I am willing to pay you anything to have a reliable individual standing in as the next of kin to my late father, so that the funds can be transfered to you. This transaction is very confidential and can only be divulged to a foreign individual who possesses the same or similar information.

 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCEREN. Dear Beneficiary, Good day, Compliment of season to you and welcome to my page. I know this mail will come to you as a surprise. Nevertheless, it is a divine wish and a matter of faith that I as a human being should reach you for assistance and comfort. I am Dr. Charles Taylor, a senior staff with the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MEMRI) in Ghana. I am contacting you concerning contract/agreement amounting US$18,000,000.00 (Twenty Eight million United States Dollars) which was originally executed for the oil servicing and marketing company of my Ministry. The funds were originally billed to the original contractor who has since passed away. This is the main reason why I contacted you to assist me in replying me immediately since no shipping or consequential charges were incurred by either party and the funds have already been credited to your account. Lately, I have been making movement on behalf of my colleague to Europe where he is due to be paid his last stipend. On this note, I have decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the funds and property left behind by my colleague. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the beneficiary of this fund. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Thanks and God bless you for your kindness and sympathy. Sincerely yours. Charles Taylor (PL/N Charles Taylor/Email: c_taylor03@yahoo.com) - contact Charles

Title: Business Proposal
 Business Proposal I have a new email address! You can now email me at: james_tobi@hofspaten.dk Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr. James Tobi, a member of the Bank of Japan (BoJ). I write you this letter based on the objective to assist you in relocating to your country. I served as a member of the Credit Unions board of the BoJ for nine years before his came to power. On the 22nd of August 1997, I was a Politician and a Vice president before the current government came to power. The present Government has suppressed all Opposition Forces and Forces loyal to the present Government. On the contrary, certain sections of the Military and the Policemen have been Slaying their Enemies. The present Government has also Mysteriously eliminated all Opposition Forces and Forces loyal to the present Government. The present Government has also Mysteriously eliminated all Oppression Forces and Forces loyal to the present Government. The present Government has Mysteriously eliminated all Oppression Forces and Forces loyal to the present Government.  In the opinion of the present Government, all Forces loyal to the present Government have been utterly defeated, as can be clearly seen from the current situation in the country. As a matter of fact, as per the present situation, it is impossible for any Forces to restore balance of power in the country. The present Government acts like an Organised Crime syndicate and practically all Forces that are opposed to the present Government have been totally defeated by the present Government. The present Government has issued many Excuses to Forces that evaded Enactments and Ordinances. Such Excuses have included, but are not limited to: - Being late for work/school related appointments; - Having left the country before the due date was met. - Failing to include key documents for signatures on Power of Attorney (P.O.B) and power of attorney (P.O.A). - Having provided inadequate explanation for why certain appointments were made. - Having granted themselves the privilege of vetoing certain appointments. There have been numerous irregularities and forgeries discovered during the last decade in the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). These irregularities and forgeries resulted in a severe blow to the financial integrity of some Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) nominated Paper Money and these Paper Money was eventually unwound and unwound it's face value was significantly reduced, (approximately 35% of the face value) By virtue of its nature as Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Refinancing Note Banque Opaque. In order to avoid the unwinding of this money, theForks Over made numerous proposals to avoid this problem. In the opinion of the Forks Over, it is better to let this money be unwound and unwound it's face value. Many suggested that this Money be used in investment / real estate. Such offers were rebuffed and some Offerors were made to use part of this money in investment. In the end, it was decided that 25% of the total money be used for investment / real estate.                               This percentage was agreed upon by all Offerers and the Forks Over.                                                 This Money is being offered by the Forks Over as a donateable
