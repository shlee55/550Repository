Title: Consultancy Proposal
 Consultancy Proposal ATTN:Pro bono,                            2115, P.M. Avenue, 14TH floor, Lower East Side, New York 10022, United States. Dear Friend, My name is Barrister J N.B.B.I, the personal Attorney to  a client who was a Foreign Contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Nigeria. My client was a  Broker/Dealer with the Shell Corporation in Contract Award approval,revisions and payments for the following contract worth of USD$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my department. The contract was for the construction of crude oil storage tanks for the importation of crude oil from within Africa into United State of America under License Agreements which are usually valid for twenty five years. Upon the successful negotiation of the contract,the contractor informed us that the new contract go through the normal grievance process and the new contract was awarded to a company of the same name from Nigeria who was also a Broker/Dealer with the same company. The old company management was replaced by that of the present Government and these license agreements are rarely enforced. When the new Government came to power in my country, they immediately terminated all agreements with Broker/Dealer with the Shell Corporation and registered the account of the old contractor with a foreign name as a contingency and beneficiary,so that the new contractor can be informed about the change of management in my client's country. Per the  contract, the amount in question is now rightfully being held in our bank as unclaimed funds. A notification was sent to the Broker/Dealer's forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that the old company management is no longer alive and no longer in the country they used to operate and all that is left of my client is his Bank Account. The amount in question is now in my client's BANK and the management is not aware of the existence of the account because there is no next of kin or beneficiary. My proposal to you is that I will like you to stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be approved and then go into the account of my bank for the funds to be paid into the account as the beneficiary next of kin. I will like you to assist in this transaction by providing, among other things, an account where the funds will be properly transferred to so that the funds will be safe there. On indicating your interest, I will furnish you with the full detailed information that will enable you get into the process of this transaction. I will then let you know where to send the money to be paid into your account. You should provide me with your completed and returned Personal Information to enable us formalize this transaction and also give you the legal authority to do business with you. For further instructions, call me for further clarification. Yours faithfully, Barrister J N.B.I

 URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL   Dear,  URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL I wish to solicit for your assistance in the investment of a significant capital I have made in your country into a very lucrative business venture of which you are to advise and execute the said venture over there for the mutual benefits of both of us. Your able co-operation is to become my business partner in your country and make investments there into high return on investment (U.S.A.) for we intend to invest our share in your country to the tune of $23,500,000.00 (Twenty three million five hundred thousand united state dollars) for a mutually agreed period of time, after which both of us will transfer the money to your custody.  I am MR. ABUBAKIND SARSAN, a well known member of the  advisory board of Nabisco, South Africa, before his death in a plane crash on the 2nd of May 2001, which killed all passengers on board. I have in my possession the sum of $19.5M (seventeen million five hundred thousand united state dollars) which was lodged in a holding bank in my name as trustee beneficiary, and since my retirement I have been unable to locate the owner of the account, as neither I nor my late husband have any family members here who are related to the account holder, as far as I know the account belonged to an anonymous person(s) who died in the same accident. I have made futile efforts to locate the late beneficiary of the account, as he was a very important person in my life before his death. I have made futile efforts to contact any of the relatives for over 2 years now, having found it unavailing. I have sent the same message to all relatives but have got no reply. I am quite certain that this is the reason for the unavailing communication you are about to make, as I have also discovered that you have no family in this part of the world, apart from my present family and they all regard me with favour, since I am the only surviving son of my late father. They all knew that my father was dead. I have made futile efforts to get in touch with any of my relatives in the West, as my family in South Africa has totally stopped cooperating with each other, and all attempts to trace his next of kin have been fruitless. I have been left with nothing as my father's particular property, which belongs to my mother and my two younger sisters. My sole hope of ever reaching my family in Africa, is if you help me to transfer this money out of South Africa, but this is a one way ticket to nowhere as my life is now in danger and there is no future for me.  I have been remarried to a man of very bad character, I hope you will not let me down, because if you do, I will abandon hope and believe in God, I have lived a very bad life so far, without any hope for the future. If you accept to help, I am willing to give you 20% of the total sum, as your interest would be enough to start a business in your country, which will then support me and my family, after I have recovered from my illness.  If this proposal satisfies you, please reply immediately, furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication, and also your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. I have also decided to give to you 20% of the entire sum, as your interest would be sufficient to start a business in your country, and after I have recovered I will visit you to meet with you. I need your assistance because I cannot manage without it. Looking forward to your urgent response. Yours sincerely, MR ABUBAKIR SARSAN

 URGENT ATTN                         URGENT URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Engineer, International Corporate Services, Chevron, (804)331-7788, emergency line: (818)279-6756, direct: +871-284-958, Dear Sir,  I am writing you based on recommendation from my secretary who is in a position to make arrangements for payment.  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Mining Consultant and Contractor with the Chevron Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Michael Doran made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron that Mr. Michael Doran died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Doran did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I want you to come forward and claim the money because I cannot claim it myself. I will give you 15% of the money for your assistance and 5% for any expense incurred in the course of this transaction. I will also issue a RESERVoir document which will prove that the funds belongs to you and authorize the post office to deliver the money to you on demand.  All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a genuine arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  I come to you with a very urgent and profitable business proposition.  I have been working in this company for almost a decade and I have decided to give you 20% of the total money while 10% will be for your assistance and 5% will be set aside to offset all expenses in my company and country  while the remaining 75% will be for me and my family investment in your country. Feel free to contact me immediately on my confidential fax number +871-284-958 and thereafter keep quiet about this deal.  I await for your urgent response.  Yours faithfully,  Dr. T.B.  Chadwell Tshweta

He also gave the Written confirmation which all consigned agreeableness and confirmed its genuineness to the Department of Finance and the lodgement of the consignment in your name as the beneficiary to be paid to you.

My  father was among the mass killed, my mother and two  of our brothers were not far from safety when the war  erupted. When the war was over, my mother and two brothers returned to  Ghana to  collect his money which was left behind by his employer. I had a feeling that I would die in the war because of the  conditions in my country now. My father was a shopkeeper and was  heavily involved in the production of Diamond and Gold.

I was shocked and I immediately called my sister to come and collect his money which was left behind for me.   I will relate more details on that when you receive this message.

 Letter from Mr.John Emsy Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr. John Emsy, the managing director of a reputable bank in Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Mark Geshem made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00, (Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Mark Geshem died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mark Geshem did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank. As a matter of fact, I discovered that Mr. Mark Geshem did not leave any next of kin in all his official documents in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately you telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me while 20% will go for you and 10% will be set aside to offset all expenses by both parties involved in the transaction.Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1. Your complete name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents for you as the owner of the funds. 2. Your personal telephone and fax number for easier communication between us. 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Each of these requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before the transfer could take place. We shall be compensating you with 35% of the total sum on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, as I have sufficiently investigated your profile to conclude that you are not associated with any known or un-corroborated account in your account history. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately so that we shall arrange on how to finalize this transaction.

Prior to the death of President Abacha, some of his family and associates were involved in a Money Mapping issue and their safety was in danger. The money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and safely transported by a military convoy to a security company here in Nigeria for safe keeping. The Security Company did not know that this box had any other owner and on further investigation, found out that the box was not the real content but was a forgery, used by one of his associates as a forgery to disguise the content. The Security Company has reason to believe that the owner of the box may be abroad, so we plan to use our position and influence on Parliament to obtain an Order of Mandamus requiring the owner to disclose his/her nationality to enable us process the box for shipment to any country of his/her choice for investment purposes.  Given the current situation in the country and government setup to assist the family, I have decided to seek for your assistance in the fields of Investment and see if you can help us to ship the money out to any country of your choice for investment purposes.  Please kindly reply to my private and confidential mail for more details.  Regards, Mr. Fahd A.Usman.

The content of the deposit was made prior to my father's death and the security company does not know the content of the deposit. I alone know about the content of the deposit and the management does not want me to know about the content of the deposit. I have worked here for 20 years and I have nothing to show for it.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers,the Federal Government of Nigeria that Mr.Aminu B.Bati (ph) died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts by the Nigerian Government to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

Title: Phone From   
 Phone From    Attn; Dear Sir/Madam, I am interested in the transfer of a large sum of money to a safe foreign account.  I am a cobbler/contractor with the federal government of Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999 an American mining consultant/contractor with the Federal government of Nigeria, Mr. David Hill made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00 (forty Million, United States dollars) into a foreign account.  After the success of our last payment attempt on the matter, the director of finance in the federal government of Nigeria, Mr. Abdul Hakim El-Hasay made another (Fixed) Deposit for the same amount of money, this time to a foreign account.  Upon maturity the money was sent to my customer, a French firm based in Singapore, Malaysia, registered as a beneficiary, but upon maturity the mail was returned undelivered.  I discovered that Mr. David Hill and his wife were both involved in a car accident and died on the spot, leaving nothing for the production of the new cheque.  I have therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. David Hill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$40M is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the late mongabay employee to seek for asylum in the Republic of Nigeria. All documentations will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside United State of America Policy of Non-Resident Foreign Investors.  Upon receipt of your reply, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via telex post work. Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative email: jeandcine@yahoo.com, or you can call me on my alternative email: 19+22907440332 Best regards, David Harvey

He was killed during the war in Sierra Leone and the personal effects of his family including his two children, one who is now in school and the other who is in the hospital with a broken hip. I inherited a total of 12 million U.S. dollars from my late husband. Since I have not seen my children for three years now, I am quite helpless as to what to do. My husband was a very good friend of mine and the bread winner of the family. He was also the one who introduced me to the country and gave me the money which I am presently holding in a security company here in Dakar. Hereinafter shall I call you as my foreign partner and my next of kin as I will come to your country to claim this money since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over three years now. I want to assure you that this money belongs to me and my family and I want you to assist me since I cannot go out as a refugee due to the laws here yet. I have already been to Sierra Leone as a refugee. Unfortunately my husband did not survive the war leaving behind a will of succession. I will be 38 years old then and I don't want anyone to know about this will and the contents of the box which was with my late husband. I want you to help me to retrieve this box out of the security company here and deliver it to you as the next of kin as indicated in my next of kin. You will also assist me to invest the money in a lucrative business which will benefit you too.

Title: URGENT MESSAGE
 URGENT MESSAGE Dear Sir/madame, May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It was hand delivered to my door by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC), who is with the Department of Foreign Exchange at the Central Bank of South Africa (C.B.A). I am Mr. Raymond Mokoena, an auditor with the Central Bank of South Africa (C.B.A).I was the personal account officer to one of the clients who died in a helicopter crash during the Gulf War in Iraq.  This client had an account opened in my branch in September 1999 and since January 2000, until his death, he had never made a (WILL) in the bank. On his death, he named his first wife and two children as his next of kin. On the 21st of January 2003, the bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his business associate that Mr.  Mohammad Najibullah had died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. MOHAMMAD NELSON died without making a WILL.  This left me as the only surviving next of kin to claim his estate.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. MOHAMMAD NELSON did not leave any (WILL) signature as the document covering the claims of his deceased account. As a matter of fact, we are practically certain that he did not leave any (WILL) signature as the document covering the claims of his account is almost certainly not the real thing as the author has almost certainly been paid by the bank.  Therefore, based on the facts and practice, I would expect that within the next ten official working days, the bank will release the fund to the account of any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin as indicated in our banking guidelines.  This will be disbursed as stated below. 1.  10% of the fund will be for expenses incurred during the course of this transaction. 2.  70% of the money will be for us (the government and the government agencies). 3.  We will use our share to purchase properties and investment bonds in the West African economy.  I have also maped out 10% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the course of this transaction, which we shall be incured to the benefit of the government agency in the industry in your country.  Finally, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity upon vanity. I await your urgent reply to enable me up-date you with more information and how to proced. Do feel free to ask me any question if you wish to as my husbands death has blocked every trace of this money from us,the documentations relating to the claim of this fund are all intact with my first son for your verification .I await to hearing from you soonest. Yours Sincerely. Mr   MR                                         MR.                                                      URGENT MESSAGE Dear Sir/madam, I am MR.  FIRST, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction that I propose to you. This by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and TOP SECRET. I got your contact in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this important and confidential business. I discovered that you have a substantial capital, which is $10 Million US dollars ($10 Million US), and I believe you are a highly reputable and trustworthy person. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. In my search in vain for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction I have recourse to the legal provisions of my country which guarantee the success of this transaction. In other words, I have successfully secured for myself and my family, the sum of $10 Million US dollars. My friend is willing to offer you 20% of this money, which you will give to the government agency with which you will base the operation and management of the fund. If my offer is accepted by you, you will be fully committed to this project and

Title: Good day my Dear Friend
 Good day my Dear Friend. My name is Dr.William Nimely, I am from Sierra Leone and a Medical doctor to the late Former President of Liberia, Mr. Charles Taylor, who according to my reliable source, may have been poisoned by the United Nation (UN) war crime commission on the Sierra Leone country. I personally accompanied my late colleague in our private medical practice to the Republic of Togo to the West African country of Guinea, where we lodged our private practice. What I want to relate to you will be a series of events which took place shortly before and during the events that lead to the death of my colleague and the seizure of our precious Farm and the subsequent disbursement of our share. Before I proceed, may I humbly introduce myself to your goodself? My name is Dr.William Nimely, I was on active service with the Liberia military from 1983 to 1990. During my duty time, I discovered some huge amounts of money which my late colleague and some close associates had deposited in a fixed or semi-fixed account in the bank here in Liberia. Upon this discovery, I and my colleagues were moved to the isolation ward of the hospital to be closer observation and the really nuts and bolts of the transaction were worked out. After the death of my colleague, I and some of my colleagues were transferred out of Liberia for security reasons and some other confidential transactions as the beneficiary's next of kin. The Liberia Government set up an enquiry commission in March 2004 to look for a foreign partner/transaction receivable abroad who would assist in the transfer of the funds to his account, where it will be remitted to his account under a foreign arrangement as listed here. The enquiry commission is chaired by my Col. Sherman Barnes and it is also intermittently functioning as a judge/jury with the mandate to award actual damages and to secure the release of the funds if any. The duty of the enquiry commission before it was dissolved by the support of the members is to lobby the government and the Central bank of the Liberia government to allow the transfer of the money to your account.  We have mutually agreed to give you 10% of the total sum for your assistance, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may arise during the course of the transaction.  I have also thought of doling out 5% to you as a special dispensation to help you in investing the money in a lucrative business in your country.

Title: Urgent  Response
 Urgent  Response Dear Friend I am Mr. Franklin Taylor, a Director with a reputable bank here in Nigeria named Royal Bank of  PLC. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition  for you. On February 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation, Mr. Claudio da Costa, a Christian, made a (Fixed deposit for thirty five  calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States  Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation that Mr. Claudio da Costa died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claudio da Costa did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claudio da Costa did not leave any valid name or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of $30,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping . No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my lawyer.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Claudio da Costa when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response immediately via my confidential fax number +23417707117. Yours faithfully, Mr. Franklin Taylor

Title: Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ
 Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ Dear, I wish to write you the greetings you may so desire. Greeting in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I am a born again Christian and a member of the United Church of Christ (U.C.C.) in Nigeria. I am thirty-five years old. I am married with a son who is twenty-four years old. We are now living in United State of America (USA) after my husband's death. I have been in the USA since I was twenty years old. I have no children from my firstborn to my last born that I have had. I have no desire to father a family of four. I have been a good wife and mother to my children. As such, they will not be displeased if you marry them. I have made arrangement with a man from Congo who will be working with me in five years, to move out to the United States, but before I move out, I want you to come and visit me in the hospital immediately you received a message from the doctor treating me because I had lost consciousness. I have lost consciousness and all the members of my family have gone to the hospital to recover me. The doctor said that I may not live for the next three days because I am sucedful to treat my public speaking. So, I am taking this opportunity to let you know that we have decided to part company with one another and have put our company directorships. One of my directors, Mr. Simon (ph) is a businessman and a general partner of a reputable bank in Nigeria. He and several of his colleagues had a deposit of US$30,000,000.00 (thirty million united state dollars). The doctor has advised me that I may not live long, so I now decided to part company with him and move the money to the United States. I want to invest most of my family's future in your country, so I wish you come down to assist our foreign partner who has kindly sent me your contact information. I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund for your assistance, while 10% shall be set aside for any expenses that might come during the course of this transaction, which will be clearly indicated on the documents that accompanied this mail. Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred to your country will be sure for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity. May the grace of our Lord Jesus the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,wonder in you, the Lord God is upon you. Amen. I await for your urgent reply. Yours Sincerely, E.I.P. Daniel A.

Title: Business Invitation From Mrs.Charakroult.
 Business Invitation From Mrs.Charakroult. From: Mrs.Charakroult
                                   Dear Friend, My name is Mrs.Charakroult, I am 42 years old ,I am married to Mr. Howard K. Charakroult. I am the wife of the former President of Liberia, who was recently impeached and killed by John Funke during the War in My Country since 1999. Before my husband was impeached and killed, he took me to see a doctor who diagnosed me with Meniere's disease. The doctor prescribed me this medicine to treat my symptoms. But as the wife of my late husband, I didn't know that this medicine could kill me. Before my husband was impeached and killed, he took me to see a doctor who said that I may not live long. That's why he compiled a special committee to review all previous presidents of the Liberia Republic for possible projects that was set up by the present president to review and approve all prior and subsequent decisions of the committee for the following three years. The committee has just finished its work and is ready to approve the sales of any mineral right that is within our control, upon acceptance of your proposal as the perfect partner to handle this transaction. The source of this fund is as follows: During my husband's life in the Liberia Republic, he made some investments here in the United States and there in the form of bonds and shares in several companies. The bonds and shares were all mature and the United States government has recently stopped paying me my overdue dues.  As a widow with three children and a nursing husband, it is against the ethics and norms of the Liberia Republic to receive this kind of fund as a deceased beneficiary. I want to transfer this money out of the Liberia Republic in my name with the help of a foreigner and into your account in the United States. I have the facilities to vet any and all foreign accounts. All I need is your honest co-operation to enable me see this deal through. You will be given 20%of the total sum, I have set aside 10% of the total sum for any expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction. Come to find out, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the hands of the committee that just concluded its work fine. I know that I am going to be in the hands of the committee that will decide my future and also my status in the society. I got your contact information from a reliable source, I will give you all the clearance papers you need in the next ten official working days. When I got your contact, I immediately made arrangements with a member of the Liberia Republic Special Compensation Committee, who will assist you in the course of this deal. The representative will come over to meet you in Liberia once we have established a reliable business relationship.  I am very confident that this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between our two countries.  Please note that this deal is 100% legal and risk free. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction is risk free in nature.   I await your urgent reply. Yours sincerely, Mrs.Charakroult Well done.

I got your contact in due course from my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle the transfer of a country's money to a foreign account.  The source of this fund is a diamond purse from the reign of former PRESIDENT/PM, HERMAN CHIMONG who was a political prisoner.  The Republic of Zimbabwe (RZ) was ruled by his political opponents; this is the reason why pretty much all the officials are now being arrested and prosecuted.  Before his death, President/PM, HERMAN CHIMONG had taken to the Johannesburg North African International Airport to Dublin to pick up his family and personal effects which he had deposited safely in the security company here in South Africa. But at the time of his death, he had not reached Ireland.  Before his death, he had taken to the Johannesburg North African International Airport to pick up his family and personal effects which he had deposited safely in the security company here in South Africa. But at the time of his death, he had not reached Ireland.  After a thorough search, I discovered that President/PM, HERMAN CHIMONG and his family died in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. There was no will of succession so all the property that is presently in the Republic of Zimbabwe belongs to the President/family.  No other person knows about this discovery except me, the researcher. I am contacting you because I want you to assist me in claim ing this family of ours and the estate. All documents, photographs and biological data concerning the deceased are with me now because I want you to stand as the next of kin to the deceased so that the latter can be paid his full allotment in your country.  As a result of this, I need your assistance in the following areas: 1. To make an urgent arrangement to the highest court in your country for the payment of the stipulated amount (2. To provide a safe account into which the fund will be transfered to and 3. To actively search for a reliable and sincere partner to assist me to transfer this fund out of South Africa for investment in a lucrative business in your country.  All these require a very high degree of trust and a high degree of confidentiality. If you accept to assist me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that there will be no doubt in future. 2. To provide an account in which the fund will be transfered out of South Africa on our behalf. 3.

The bookkeeping clerk at the bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Bank that the deceased had died in a plane crash on the 7th of April 2000 in 1998.On further investigation, we found out that the deceased had died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that the deceased had left no next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in our Bank. This sum of US$19.8 Million has carefully been fixed in my bank for safe keeping. No one will EVER come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Title: Urgent  Business Contract Proposal. 
 Urgent  Business Contract Proposal.  Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Miriam Achen. I am the wife of the president of the republic of Sierra Leone, (former)  Chief Samuel Bill, who was formerly the friend of the president of Sierra Leone before he was killed by United  Nation (UN) force during civil war. Before his death, he took me to Johannesburg, South  Africa to meet with some foreign government officials and the like.  However, as he was about to leave the country, he was killed by the rebel soldiers of (former President of Liberia) Joseph  Faure ) during a raid on his private residence. Since then, there has not been good chance for me to leave the country because of the  civil war going on in the country. Thereafter, my husband and my two  children are facing danger from the rebels and the danger of death from disease and  from the refugees because of the famine that is ravaging the country. My husband is in a position to influence those who work with me to  come over to his country to invest the money in manufacturing, agriculture,  hotels, restaurants and similar businesses.  As a result of this, we have taken the decision to leave the country and seek for  asylum in Europe, given to you by our attorney, because we are refugees.  We want to invest the money in a country to a high standard of living because we are  not allowed to settle down in Sierra-Leone. Our main reason for  seeking asylum in Europe is because our homeland is being used as a refuge by rebels and as such, it is a  matter of high international sympathy and orderly importance to come over to  your country to open a business and to invest the money in a profitable business.  We have heard from some of the top officials of the Union of South African  Trade Unions that any business in money will be kindly  regarded by you as a reward for your assistance.  Please kindly communicate your acceptance of this message by  using the above email address and enclosing your private fax number for easy communication.  I expect your urgent response.  Thanks and Remain Blessed.  Mrs. Miriam  Achen.

I am writing  with my personal load of cash in my custody as a family mount  baggage. I got your contact from a reliable source, and after going through some of  your client's past financial disclosure statements, I am quite confident in  you.  My client, Mr. Ahmad Halasov, an Iraqi, who owned a construction company here  in the United States before he was killed by Sunni insurgents during the war in my country,  and during his time as a monarch, always maintained a very good relationship with the United  Nation, and generally supported the United States in the region,  so my client was quite pleased when his son took office as  the new monarch, with the help of God, Iraqi government troops invaded his country and  killed his entire family and placed the family treasure in  the security company vault. After the death of my  client, I immediately started looking for a reliable and  trustworthy person to assist me in  repatriating the money left behind by the United Nations, United  States of America and other international agencies, when they leave  the country to a safe location abroad, after the death of my  client. I have the deposit information of the security company and other names are being looked for. All the documents  are straight from my bank and the security of the two countries have been  carefully worked out.  The only thing we need from you is to help us to track the money, so,  we would like you to provide a safe account where the money will be  placed in a few days. We are going to use the money to buy food for the people of  Iraq, as we cannot import food products into  Iraq, while 50 percent of the money will be for us. The problem here is that we do not  know our client personally. All we have are his secretaries and two days ago they called his name again. We will give you  more information. I am waiting for your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed.  Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.

Title: Business Proposal
 Business Proposal FROM THE DESK OF: Mr.Bom Uche                                                       URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Dear Sir/Madam, I am DR.Bom Uche, the Director of Bills &amp; Exchange of the Zambian Ministry of Resources and Environment (MRO).This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1997, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Zambian Ministry of Resources and Environment, Mr.Bom Uche made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$22,500,000.00 (Twenty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Bom Uche died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Bom Uche did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$22,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be set aside for any expence incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email: tookelvin_uzuki001@juntosdelica.com Thanks and Remain bless. Bambi Uche.

Russell Ola, director of the Gold and Diamond Mining Control Company of Nigeria operating under the aegis of the Federal Government of Nigeria. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge amount of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of private investment company(s). The original value of these contracts were DELIBRATELY OVER INVOICED to the sum of USD$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is NOW READY TO BE TRANSFERED BEING THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY DESTROYED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY PAID AND THE PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED. The contracts were actually awarded and executed under a legitimate process that was actually carried out to the successful conclusion of the projects.  However, in some of the contracts the original contractors did not fully satisfied their contractual obligations. In some of the contracts the original contractors did not  fully satisfy their contractual obligations. This led to the 'surplus' money left behind by the agencies in the various countries where these contracts were actually executed. The 'surplus' money is now to be used to 'reimburse' those agencies for their expenses in executing the contracts. This process has now been  successfully completed. The contracts that have been officially 'paid' and the projects that have been commissioned and the projects commissioneded are now ready to be transferred or remitted out of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to any country of your choosing for the investment of that type. Your `responsibility' for claiming this fund should be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free, and the transaction is purely confidential. I hereby declare that the funds is safe in my custody and that I will assist you in investing it in your country on your `risk free path'.

Dear Friend, I am Dr.P.M.Bello, the Director of Bills &amp; Exchange and Surplus Control of the Central Bank of the  African World, Uganda.I got your contact in our search for a reliable and  cooperative foreign partner that will assist us in processing payments for the  payments due to be made during the course of our business transaction.    We have a foreign partner, a Mr. John Angue who has a PrÃ©sidentity Bank account in Uganda with a  closing balance of US$18,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million United States Dollars only) as next of kin.   He wishes to have the money and dynasties proceeds in your country with out you being involved.   What we need from you is to provide a safe account into which the money will  be transferred and an account open for the movement and other investment of the funds in your country.   If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so that we can arrange how to move the money to your country.   Keep in mind that you are not contacting us to beg for support, but rather to a desire to invest in your country.   If that is alright by you, do let me know by returning the fax number above so that  we can go over the details.    on the 6th of September 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,  Mr. John Hughes made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued at US$18,000,000.00) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.  John Hughes died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John Hughes did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.   This sum of $18,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as Mr. John Hughes's next of kin. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of a solicitor for the drafting and  notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of administration in your  stead as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of a solicitor and also the services of an attorney for the drafting and  notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of administration in your  name as the beneficiary and on your behalf as the next of kin. The money will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin if you are able and willing to assist us. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant document�s that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

ATTN:EQ:YOUR-SELF Dear Partner, I am a lady of the People's Revolt and struggle for Freedom, wife to the late Dr. Mohammed Fustafuyi of Liberia from whom we were separated during the war. During the war our husband was commanding in the Liberia Democratic Army (L.E.A.I) to the north-east of the country, and before his death we were both captured by the Liberian military and later killed. My husband was a brigadier in the Liberian military before his death and was planning to invade the country with his family when his wife and two children were kidnapped from their home.  Before my husband's death, he made me to understand that he deposited the sum of $7,000,000.00 (seven million united state dollars) in a private security company in Senegal under my name as a family valuable. He further informed me that the security company will release the fund once we have reached certain percentage of the fund. Regrettably, my husband did not survive the war and I cannot bring my family back to Liberia.  I have been to the office of the security company and confirmed the authenticity of the deposited fund. My husband was a prosperous farmer, before his death he had taken me to Senegal where I found out that he deposited the money in a security company and the commission of the deposit was confirmed by the High Court of Senegal to the tune of US$16million (Twenty eight million, six hundred thousand united state dollars).  I am now soliciting for your assistance to receive the money as my late husband was into foreign governments with my family, as such I have taken the liberty of soliciting for your assistance to receive the money as my late husband was into a foreign country where I am presently in detention on trumped up charges of corruption and money laundering. My husband was a brigadier before his death, his family denied ever knowing about my husband's life and property in Nigeria but after my husband's death, I discovered that my late husband was an orphan and had no known or living parent. I was married with children, I am now single and homeless. I have been to the office of the security company and confirmed the authenticity of the deposit. I am seeking for your help in receiving the money as my late husband was a very rich man before his death.  I am presently on the run and have not gone back to my country, my family and I are still in Liberia.  I have two older sons who are against me and I have to find a way to save my family without going back to Liberia. I have nothing to fall back on. I have been to the office of the security company and confirmed the authenticity of the deposit.  I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum, for your assistance, and 2% of the remaining money for your assistance in the area of investment, I have mapped out 20%, for you and 2% for you and your family while 2% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.  I have all the necessary documents that can back up any claim we may make, all I require is your sincere, honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I have 3 sons from my first son to the present day. I have decided to give you 20% of the total sum, 2% for you and your family while 2% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.  I have everything in place, all I need is for you to contact me on my direct private TEL: +27-83-509-081 for more details. Please, call me on this number immediately you recieve this mail if you are interested. Yours faithfully, Mrs.AISHA MOHAMMED.

Title: Urgent
 Urgent Dear , My name is Doris Odoh. I am a widow, a daughter of late Mr. Stevan Odoh who was a sugarcane and/orchards/farm owner in Liberia. My father was a prosperous man, and he particularly loved his life and his farms. But at the time of the revolution in Liberia he was attacked and killed by the rebel army of Dr John Charles Mbonjo upto the death of him all the family . My mother and sister escaped to Sierra-Leone but my mother died on the way with my father before I was able to leave in the morning. When I was about to leave by the help of an army colonel, I was killed in the hand. The next day I saw a man named Mr. Charles Taylor, who ran away from the hand of my father and killed me as well. Before my death I had made arrangement with two of my family's friends to visit his country of origin, to look for a genuine and legitimate business and after a thorough search found your contact in relation to your country of origin, it was true that a small business could not successfully operate in a more corrupt and unstable political environment than Liberia, but I was sure that of all the corrupt government officials that still exist in Liberia, Mr. Charles Taylor would be the last to be tried and convicted. After all the deaths, I was afraid that my life and that of my children depended on it if I did not leave Sierra-Leone immediately.I now seek your permission to have you stand as my foreign partner in a business transaction, because I have declared that my foreign partner should be his country of origin as indicated in my banking guidelines, and also I want you to assist my two younger sisters to plan their lives and destinies in your country. All I want from you is for you to undertake all the processes as implied in our agreement, and then come to meet me in person, so that we can discuss physically and spend time togetherly, after which you will be given 30% of the money while 60% will be for my family and I. The money will be disbursed in the proportion indicated.If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance.

Title: Business Transaction  Dear Sir,  My name is Mr. Ahamed Van Leeuwen, I am from the Philippines and an auditor at one of the Bank in Hong Kong. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of foreign firms in the market for new contract execution and design of new plants and equipment of all kinds in the support of the programme originally approved by the Bank of England in 2001.The original scope of these contracts were to mop up the difference in value made by the various contractors as a result of different decisions and actions taken by the government of the Philippines in the government since the ousting of My late father from office. The original scope of these contracts were: Maintain and upgrade of existing plants and equipment for delivery in 2026.Operate a new plant and equipment of all kinds in the support of the programme until at the end of its life in 2032.Supply my father's old age pension fund with overseas account.  These contracts were supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors at a tender and the contract was supposed to be awarded to a consortium of foreign firms. But in fact the companies that actually executed the contracts were selected and paid by the Filipino firm,while the remaining parts of the original contract were to be owned by the British firm. The contract life of the British firm is about five years; however, in some of the contracts it has actually expired and the owner of the account in question has been unresponsive to our attempts to contact him.  Consequently, my present solution of using my position as an auditor at one of the foreign contract paying companies to try and get in touch with any of the deceased contractor's family members or relatives to get the money to the rightful person as the beneficiary.  However, this business proposal is risk free as I have already disclosed in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE Dear Assimilator, I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia and my efforts in searching for a reliable and reputable business partner. I am writing you based on the recommendation to my secretary who happens to be a prospective business man as he is now in his mid-30s. I am writing you because I discovered some money while I was on a business trip to your country a year and a half ago. The source of the fund is a secret and it is being kept very carefully in a bank vault in my country. The amount in the vault is $12m USD and the owner of the vault is  a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) living in (Nigeria) who has an account opened in the bank in (Nigeria) and died on 9th November 2001. His next of kin is a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) who died in the same accident(he was in a motor accident) and his account in the bank is closed. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for the money as his Foreign partner. I cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. When this discovery made me to contact you, I felt that you would be in a position to assist me in  receiving this fund in your country as I have applied for refugee status in your country as a refugee. The banking ethics here stipulates that after five years the money will be transferred to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. In order to avoid this, the bank now proposes that you as a Foreigner or Australian resident should help me to have the documents proving my identity called up to the court and show that I am the person that actually made the deposit. This is simple and requires the absolute co-operation of both of us. You must apply first to the court to enable the relevant documents to be sent to the court and then I will apply to the court for the transfer of the funds to your account. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I shall be very glad if you accept my proposal in good faith and acknowledge the receipt of this letter in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor, though I do hope you will not feel pressure to assist me. May Allah bless you and your family as you see fit. Please do not make undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed. MR URGES NGANG

Title: AN URGENT ASSISTANCE FOR A FOREIGN INVESTMENT TRUST FUND.
 AN URGENT ASSISTANCE FOR A FOREIGN INVESTMENT TRUST FUND. Dear Sir/Madam, (J) you are receiving this mail from us without any other source of your choosing. We are members of the Special Committee for the re-election campaign of our party in the United Nations (UN). The re-election campaign of our Committee is being assisted by some specially-trained International Secretaries. The aim of this mail is to solicit your assistance in the area of Investment overseas. We are members of the Committee for the re-election campaign of our party and we are seeking your assistance in the area of Investment. Our country is currently in a dire situation, with problems of its own making and we are beset on all sides by various problems of our own making. This is a situation that can never be easily remedied, as every aspect of our lives depends on this fund. We have submitted before the UN Commission on Human Rights our views on the treatment meted out to us by our Government, which we control, as Members of the UN Committee, when we were summoned to the Committee room to give our reports. These reports were thoroughly examined and after due deliberation with our own members, we came to the conclusion that we should not bother seeking for foreign assistance in this matter, as we are all members of the same Party now, we are all foreigners, and therefore, should unite in seeking foreign assistance since the same problem confronts us all. To enable us invest our own share into a foreign country, we have to find a foreign partner who will serve as our foreign partner/receiving country. To this end, we have in our possession the sum of US$15,000,000.00.(Fifteen million united state dollars) the value of which has been arranged and is floating in the computer system of a bank here in my country, we have all the necessary legal documents to enable the bank to process the fund as a foreign partner/receiving country. As it is now, this fund will not go into your account unless you specifically state where and how you will want it to be invested. For your assistance, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum, which is  22% of the total sum as profit for your assistance, and 2% to be used in settling taxation, and 3% to be used in paying off the necessary legal fees and local and foreign expenses. Please note that the fund is floating in the system and the management is not aware of the content. I have every proof of ownership in the system as all the documents presently relating to the fund are in order. All I require is your co-operation and sincerity to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my private email address as soon as you receive this message, so that we can discuss the modalities of seeing this deal through. I shall be grateful if you take this proposal very seriously. Please do not reply me as soon as you receive this message, as I will want you to reply only to this email. Please reply to: engridude@microsoft.com Best Regards, Mr.      E. RidU, domestic.

====================
From: Mr Zuhair Idris
Title: URGENT BUSINESS MATTER.
 URGENT BUSINESS MATTER. Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr Zuhair Idris the manager of International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Nigeria. I am writing you based on the trust given to me by the members of my committee. Before the death of my late colleague, he was a member of the Union of Petroleum Producers (UOP), he was assassinated by his body guard during the winter months in a bid to stop his movement to his country Russia. The Union of the world's largest petroleum exporters have asked the Federal Government of Nigeria to supply them with the sum of US$10,500,000.00 (ten million five hundred thousand united state dollars) to help it process the  products of the contract that was supposed to be executed in your favor.   The product in question is a steam condensate pipeline construction. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a consortium of seven US firms, three Japanese firms and two South African firms. The contract was supposed to be for the construction of power plants to supply electricity to developing countries in Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa. However, on the day the contract was awarded to the South African firms, the Federal Government of Nigeria told the firms that the contract had been awarded to them. The South African firms were directed to supply half of the total contract fund, while the remaining share is to be used in the project.   The South African firms have successfully completed the supply of the raw materials, the Federal Government of Nigeria told the South African firms, but there was a catch, the South Africans demanded that the funds be released to them in cash on arrival of the finished product, which the South Africans refused to do.   A few days later, the South Africans stopped sending money to the Federal Government of Nigeria, and the contract was awarded back to the Japanese and South African firms.   After the contract had been awarded, the Japanese and South Africans stopped claiming the funds, and the funds was left there unclaimed.   A few weeks ago, my position as a manager in the office of the President of the office of President of the Republic of Nigeria made me the only person with the relevant information regarding this fund.   I discovered that the Japanese and South Africans had all but stopped claiming the fund, because the Japanese Government had stopped paying them their due share.    I therefore made futile efforts to get in touch with them, as I was being monitored closely by the security company. I have tried all kinds of channels but to no avail. I have discovered that in some countries - especially countries with Communist Governments such as China and Russia - the Communist Party Central Committee may not allow members to run for office again for several reasons including being critical of the Government, People and policies. In other countries where democratic processes are not as strict, members of the Government may not be responsive to pressure. In these countries, a member of the Government may be killed for 'disgraceful' reasons, such as supporting the Government. In these cases, the money may have been 'lost' to the Japanese or South Africans, and is therefore 'unclaimed' by the Japanese or South African Government. In some countries, a member of the Government may simply be removed from office before the next election by the President. In other countries, the Government may not tolerate criticism of Government, especially if it is caused by corruption. In China and Russia, for example, Government Agencies frequently remove their own party members from office.     I have discovered that if I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africans will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africans will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africans will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africans will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africans will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africa will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africa will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out of the country, by the end of the year the Japanese and South Africa will be out of my country.     If I do not move this money out

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to my client so that the bank will file in a WILL in your name as the next of kin.

Title: PROPOSITION
 PROPOSITION Dear Friend, My name is Mr. Roland Bartic, I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of three contracts executed by one of our foreign customers in the private sector in favour of our bank in favour of the United Bank for Africa (UBA). The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of $31,500,000.00 (thirty one million five hundred thousand united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Unfortunately, the life of our customer, a citizen of Brazil by name, late engineer and company, Mr. Simon Dani, died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr.Simon died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Simon did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to Mr.Simon so that the funds would be released in your favour and then be transferred to your account in your country. On being satisfied that you are suitable to offer as a next of kin, I will issue a WILL setting forth the terms and conditions for this transaction. I have all necessary legal documents that would back up any claim we may make and we must adhere to them to ensure a smooth deal. Once the notice is circulated, all our personnel will converge at the site of the transfer to begin the transfer of the funds to your account in your country without delay and we will commence immediately. We have successfully executed over 70% of the total contract and the life of our customer is now officially confirmed over invoiced.    I have successfully secured from the probate an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. I have also landed a big reward for you from the federal securities and law firm. I am now soliciting your assistance to provide account in which the funds will be transferred to in your name. You are also going to provide a safe account in which the funds will be transferred to in your name. I have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum, while 65% will be mine. I have also committed to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, 5% will be for expenses incurred during the transaction, while the remaining 5% will be for my share holding in this business venture. If you are interested, send me an email to indicate your interest via my secure email account. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Do not send the above fax or direct message to prevent a delay in action. Send your reply only to this letters, use this email too for faster communication. Yours Sincerely, Mr.Mr.Roland Bartic

Title: CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Friend. I am writing you based on recommendation by a good friend who has asked me to write to you regarding a business ( GOLD AND COCOA) here in India which she deposited in my name with a security and finance company here in the city of Calabar Branch of Nigeria. I am Mrs Susan Kroult, the wife of late Director of Federal Government of Nigeria, Mrs. Susan Kriket . I have two sons, who died in the course of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. My son was working with the Central Bank of Nigeria when he was killed by suicide bomber in Baghdad airport on the 6th of April 2004. Since I have lost confidence of the security company where he deposited the deposit, and have been asking the manager to release the deposit to my family for investment, he has told me that he has conveyed to the security company the name of the deceased, the director and the director of the company as the next of kin of the deceased, but has instructed us to withhold this information to avoid any misunderstanding. I want to state here again that his life and that of my family depends on the money as such I will not let it be known to my family until I personally know the next of kin. This is my reason of contacting you for this transaction. Firstly, I need your assistance in the investment of this money, since I have tried and failed before in locating any of the deceased relatives for the project. I need your sincere co-operation in this project, which is of the utmost confidentiality. I am aware of the international sanctions, embargoes and restrictions on movement of certain commodities as a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as a result of which my charter flight to Europe on the 1st of May 2005 was arranged and paid for by my State Bank of Nigeria, as the beneficiary of the money which was allocated for my family by the director of the company before his death. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign partner with a genuine and adequate knowledge of international monitory policy. At the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the foreign partner to the deceased. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number, full Biographical Information, direct fax number and the like to enable us start the project immediately. Secondly, you will also help us in investing the money in a lucrative business. If you are interested, send me the information regarding the deceased, including your direct fax number and the like, which will enable us start the project immediately. I will bring a lawyer to the project immediately you indicate your interest to assist us in investing the money in your country. On receiving your positive response, we will then start the project immediately. Depending on your urgent response, we will initiate the production of the deposit certificate within 14-15 banking days.I will be waiting to hear from you and if you are interested, please reply immediately. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Best Regards. Mrs. Susan Kroult.

The actual amount in the account is(U.S.$2,220,000.00)two million, ten thousand two hundred and twenty united state dollars (us$2,220,000.00).However, the management decided to look for a trust worthy foreign partner abroad, who will assist us in repatriating the fund to his country, or any other country of his choosing, as soon as possible because the management no longer knows the client's foreign account holder or beneficiary.The foreign account holder is a deceased account holder in a number of different countries including the UK, USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and China. The account was opened in these countries without any other person knowing about it.The account has expired and all attempts to track the account owner have come to naught.I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the Audit Committee of the F.N.A.W (A.C.A) to look for a foreign account to receive the fund on behalf of the management, as all documentations will be in the management's control and we will share the money accordingly.

Title: Greeting from Dubai.
 Greeting from Dubai. ATTN,  Greeting from Dubai. Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ, I have been counseled to contact you concerning a business transfer of a sum of $22,000,000.00 (twenty-two million united state dollars). The source of this fund is as follows; I discovered from the confidential communication published in your newsletter on the business of a deceased consultant/contractor with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing here in DAKAR TENDER AREA, that he/she/it may not have lived to see out his/her due date. I therefore made personal investigation and found out that the consultant/contractor did not leave any next of kin in the world, and the fund was transferred to his/her custody in the private Sector Finance Company in UAE without the knowledge of his/her next of kin. I have been advised by my legal and moral advisor to seek for whom his/her last name shall be, as I have been given the impression that the deceased were members of the same family, and so it is in order to protect my family business interests to make this transfer to a foreign account, and I personally desire that this money should be the only beneficiary to the account. I have precise information of who the deceased left behind in the file of a FNB Skrill Finance and Accounting in Denmark.

Title: please reply
 please reply Dear, I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise,considering the fact that we did not know ourselves before,besides,i feel the need of urgent attention to secure our future and our families.I am despatching to you the sum of fifteen million,five hundred thousand United States dollars from the Central Bank of the Republic of Cote D'Ivoire. I discovered your contact through theuse of my private search on the Internet,and aftergoing a little more research i found out that you have no previous contact person before.after going through your previous profile,i am quite confident in your reliability and capability in the transaction of this amount of money,i will like to transfer the sum of fifteen million,five hundred thousand united states dollars into a safe foreign account and make arrangement for the transfer within 10 days.i have the authority and mandate of the chairman of the board of  the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the Federal Republic of Cote D'Ivoire,Mr. Jobeel Laurent,who died in the 1992 air crash,that took place on the island of St. Domingo,Cote D'Ivoire on the 19th of May, 2001, as a result of which my board of Directors has frozen our accounts and cancelled all our worth in the bank. This is borne out of a cash deposit made by one of our customers, who died along with his entire family as a result of X-ray sickness from the plane crash.in other word,i have given notice to our bank to provide the account owner with his foreign account information,so far nothing has changed as the bank still does not know the account owner.as a result of this,the bank now believe that the account owner is dead and its late director was never heard from again.I am contacting you because of the need to involve a newfangled foreign account. I discovered in their files that our deceased customer had an account open in the bank in 1990 and died in 1996, and in the year 2004, we discovered that the account owner died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account owner did not leave any next of kin or relations in his environment before his death, and the FNB has published in the British newspapers that his name does not exist any more. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account. I want you to provide a safe account where the fund will be safe kept pending my arrival to your country to claim it, since I have discovered that some years ago in a similar situation taken care of by a very reliable and honest person who is now in government (acting in my place), we had a tidy sum of twelve million united state dollars(u.s.dollars) deposited in an account opened in your name.I am contacting you because the security of the fund is not as tight as it used to be, and I want you to help me to move this money out of the country as soon as possible for investment purposes, because the money is being rolled over with a high interest. I have three options: 1.I can offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 2.I can make arrangement for us to meet face to face, 3.I can make arrangement for us to invest the money in a lucrative business in your country, but all these will involve risking the safety of our family and our homes. If you can assist me,please do not hesitate to contact me back on my private email: (jauba200@maktoob.com) or to give me your telephone and fax number; this will enable us meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that the funds can be moved out of the country.This is a risk free business transaction, and you should do the right thing and let me know when you receive this message so that we can go ahead and share the money when this money is moved into your account. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately so that we can discuss the modalities of seeing this transaction through.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. (a) Your full names and address; (b) Your telephone and fax number; (c) Your personal information, where you will like us to lodge your bank account details in your country and other relevant information, for example your bank name, address, and personal information about you. I shall be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you so desire, but do urge you to give the matter your immediate attention it deserves. Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested, because if you do, it will be the end of my life. I await your urgent response. Yours faithfully,

Title: BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
 BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT ATTN /C. Dear Friend, I am from Australia and one of the personal aid to the president of Liberia the former head of state of the independent country Liberia, (later, to become a sub-Saharan Africa nation) Mr. Charles Taylor. I was in Liberia before his death and I have  personal information with regard to an oil discovered in my country that has since been successfully processed and is now  ready to be transferred to a security and finance firm for safe keeping. The name used in this transaction is that of foreign goverment man that was an  enemy of the motherland when she was in power. The government has now cabled me to transfer this  money to the security and finance firm for safe keeping pending my  arrival to meet with the foreign partner that will take  possession of the consignment and  forward to me the funds to the security and finance firm. My personal relationships in  these matters is such that I would not object if the funds was transferred to the security and  finance firm  that will take it from me. I have all necessary legal documents that i will  present to the security and finance firm when I get the chance. However, some things I have to  assure you first and foremost. Firstly, I cannot introduce this transaction to  the general public because it is  a secret that Liberia has not had a functioning justice system for  many years. The present Liberia government, being a  president of the peaceful transfer of such vast sums of  money, has led to a huge amount of money being lost to  corrupt officials and mob  upon corrupt officials. The business of  corrupt officials and mob  alike has gone downhill from here. If i do  introduce this transaction to you, I will require from you 10% of the  total money to be safe keeping in your country. I have all the  relevant documents from the storage company and the central bank of Liberia. I am  certain that you will not let me down. Please treat this as urgent and  very confidential. Please also contact me on my alternative email address at:  +44704011296. I am presently in Dakar, Senegal,  but have no computer with which to send or receive email. I will appreciate if you contact me through this my private email  address because the document covering this transaction is with the clerk of the Reserve Bank of  Liberia and the security company that has received the consignment has direct  access to the electronic data connection. Please I will require you to mail me on call on my private email:  +44704011296 or send me a mail to the right address given below for  immediate communication. PLEASE, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE YOUR HOME  OR COMPUTING STATION YOUR SELF IN ORDER TO HANDLE SUCH TRANSACTION OR THE  CONVERT TO WESTERN MUTUALLY CONVENTIONAL CONTRACT IN YOUR OWN FUTURE.

Title: CONSIDER IT URGENT
 CONSIDER IT URGENT Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi. I am Iraq refugee, wife to the late Lieutenant Colonel James Hashemi, who was during his tenure as a military Commander in the Saddam Hussein regime until his death, and during his reign as the leader of the Republican Guards in Iraq before he was killed by American troops during the Gulf War. Before my husband was killed by American troops during the Gulf War on November 2003, he was fighting in Support of Military Action Against Iraq during the war which he helped to lead to victory over Iraq. Before his death, he had taken me to Kuwait to deposit the sum of US$11 million (Eleven million United States dollars), and declared it in a security company, which I managed before my husband was killed. The money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The Security Company did not know that the money was actually the proceeds of a business transaction and he fully expected that the Security Company would never suspect that the money was the product of his business investment. The Solutions? There is one simple and very effective way to move this money out of Iraq and out of Iraq as a refugee. By providing a safe account where the money will be safe from physical seizure and confiscation by the Iraqi government. By providing an account where I will be safe from physical seizure and confiscation by the Iraqi government if I accept to be his beneficiary. I wish to state here that Iraq is a corrupt and chaotic government that does not serve the interests of the Iraqi people and that those who claim to serve the people often exploit the desperation of the people.  I have already made arrangement with a lawyer and other legal advisers to move this money out of Iraq, but due to the inherent instability in Iraq as a result of war and unrest, Iraq has become a haven for corruption and terrorism. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, there were 202,000 refugees in Iraq as of the end of November last year, up from the previous month, 2002. This means that Iraq is completely safe for investment. There are no risks involved. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a female relative. I need your assistance because Iraq is a poor country where survival is not guaranteed and any relative can become a victim of war. I have met some good people among the refugees and they have encouraged and assisted me to move this money out of Iraq. I wish to declare here that my assistance has been fully utilized. If you are interested in assisting me to invest this money in a lucrative business in your country, kindly contact the lawyer and his associates immediately.  I am waiting for your urgent response. Please reply to my private and confidential email:  mrsslioc@tiscali.co.uk  Yours faithfully. Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

But when the deadline for payment came and went by without a claim, The money was classified as "Worst Possible Deemed".The president said  that could not be done because the whites are  against him.  So, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but without any reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, The Democratic  Republic of the Congo, that Mr. Bongani died from a bullet wound to the head. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Bongani did not declare any next of kin or any relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of $21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) has carefully been fixed in my bank for safe keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreign partner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited five years ago. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 20% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this deal will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Yours sincerely, Mr.SAMSON BAMOGU

 URGENT Attn/Pls Dear Sir/Madam, I am Barrister Bahram el Sisi, a Solicitor. I was a Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria before my retirement in early 2001. One of my colleagues and I were involved in the contract award and recommendation review with a foreign contracting firm in the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria for the supply of ammunations, hard/soft wares,phamaceuticals/medical items,light and heavy duty vehicles, ammunations procured from United Nations  ATOMI and other international agencies. We were involved in supplying equipment for the purchase of aircraft,phantom aircraft,consignment and equipment for the supply chain development of the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria. We are the only partners with whom we have a position in this business. We negotiated a down payment of 35% of the total sum to be used in collaboration with you for the purchase and lease of an aircraft,to be used for civilian and military purposes respectively, by the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in the country. The equipment was supposed to be delivered to you as a result of a positive balance in our favour to enable us take delivery of the equipment in your name. Instead, we received negative balances as a result of over invoicing and over invoiced taxes,and as such, we are seeking to transfer the equipment into your account to enable us transfer the funds to your country for investment purposes. We agreed on the amount when we met in my chambers the previous month. We have agreed to share the equipment and relevant funds as follows:- (1) 70% for us (2) 10% for you (3) 5% for the expences both will incure during the time of transfer. We hope to invest our share in a real estate project in your country as you will be our business partner. Please note that this transaction is risk free. If the equipment is delivered to you as desired and your company's role is properly filled, we shall organize and implement the project in your country into the schedule and estimate as soon as the equipment is in your possession. At the conclusion of the transfer, you will be given 35% of the total sum, 60% will be for me and you while 5% will be for the expences both will incure during the time of the transfer. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. You can reach me with my confidential fax number +23416704189 or you can send me email to allow me brief you the procedure. Awaiting to hear from you soon Mr Bahram el Sisi.

During the war, some private security company officers were on leave, when the conflict erupted in my country. I was made to work as a personal security guard to the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone after the death of the former President, ROBERT VANESSA, during a military campaign, which took us a long time to resolve. During this time I was regularly in Sierra Leone, mainly to pick up shipments from the Customs, who had to change their shipping containers to take goods through the Suez Canal tow as a protection for his precious Diamonds. The Sixty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars was changed into your account when the former President was killed. I am presently in England, working with a private firm, as a civil servant, so I cannot operate a foreign account, but I have made arrangement to have that right. Within the last few days, my proposal to you was accepted by a member of the staff of the private security company who is a Diamond/Gold Merchant and he directed me into business relationship with you. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, and 2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction, which includes, telephone bills, theft and any form of general miscellaneous would be borne by you. We have decided to business relationship because you are familiar with private sector and you would be expected to assist us in investment in your country. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Title: Business Transaction/Agreement
 Business Transaction/Agreement Dear responsive, I got your contact from the UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry. As you may be aware that during the tenure of the former Military Head of State of the United Arab Emirate (U.A.E) Ahmed Shafi Al Nasser, who as a result of his death, succeeded in imposing his will on all the Emirates (except Oman) except Oman and West Africa which he governed with an iron fist and oppressive rule for twenty-three years. Before his death, Shafi Al Nasser personally appealed to the West African Chamber of Commerce and Industry to help him transfer some money remaining of our huge oil wealth accumulated in the West African economy into a foreign account. This amount of US$25M (twenty five million United State Dollars) was deposited by one of our foreign customers who happened to be a foreigner. However, upon my insistence, the money was done with the assistance of a Secuerity Company in Thailand for safe keeping and subsequently, the deposit certificate issued to the Thai company has been changed to reflect the transfer of the funds to a foreign account. As a result, the money will be changed into a foreign account and then out of the country altogether. I made personal arrangements with a lawyer and also used his services to propose to the bank the details of the deposit. The bank is presently unaware of the existence of the deposit and the change of the deposit certificate. The owner of the deposit was a foreigner, a farmer/politician by name, who happened to be in a union with the United Fruit Company (U.F.C). My proposal is that the bank would waive all claim on the fund from the Thai bank and direct the funds to the account of your choice. The bank will then make arrangement with your foreign partner to provide you with an account where the money would be safe transferred since no one has heard from the owner since 1994. The proposal is that bypass the Western world for this money and send it directly to you. On commencement, the transaction will be completed within 10 days if you accord it   due chance.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 20% for you and 10%  will be for any expences both parties might have incurred during the course of the transaction. For further instructions, you may call me on my personal line 181866 or send me on my confidential fax line (248)20-52774. You should provide me with your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. I will then furnish you with details of the transaction and the next step to take. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. I will also give you more details of the transaction as soon as I receive your positive response. Keep this very confidential. I await for your urgent response. Thanks and Remain Blessed.

The contract was actually awarded in favour of the Chinese firm (Electricité Commercial Power) but was changed to the non-Chinese candidates after the re-election of President Robert Mugabe. As a result of the change of government in my country and with our part in the re-election of President Robert Mugabe, we were given the option of paying the contract into the hands of the Chinese firm or to have the contract closed down.I chose the latter option as the contract is fully controlled and both parties have satisfied all legal requirements. The contract was due to be paid to the Chinese firm in 2001 but was paid to a different Chinese firm in 2002. In order to avoid the Chinese firm from claiming the money, I want you to provide a good position for the payment of the contract to the Chinese firm in your country. On indicating your willingness,I will furnish you with the details and procedure. I have sufficient legal documents that can be used for the payment of the contract. All I require is your honest co-operation for us to see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Note: If you are  willing to assist me,please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more information and the relevant parts of the Payment Agreement between us.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  Dear , I am writing you based on the mutual trust and confidence actuated by this present conditions in my world.  My name is STANDARD COTE D'IVOIRE  head of state and Government. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Republic of Sierra-Leone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,500,000.00 (Twenty 18 Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Republic of Sierra-Leone that Mr.Mukhtar Barwa (a bureaucrat), died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Mukhtar Barwa did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

Title: Urgent  Business Proposal.
 Urgent  Business Proposal. Attn,   Greeting,    Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ our Redeemer, I am, Mr. Ahmed  El Bakir the Auditor General of a reputable bank in Nigeria named  Jubilee Bank. I came to know of you in my “private” search on the internet for a reliable person with a reputable conscience to help me transfer the sum of $41,429,000,00 (forty-one million four hundred and forty thirty‐nine united states dollars) into a foreign account. This money was a product of a contract awarded for the production of equipment for foreign customers in my country. In the course of our search, I discovered that your country is involved in a financial meltdown, with a bank branch down here in Lagos, the Federal Government threatening to close down the bank unless the help of a foreigner is taken [abandoned] by the government. The contract was for the construction of a new office building for our bank here in Nigeria, to the great relief of the employees of the bank here. The threat of closure was made possible by the sudden death of the former President of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), General Sani Abacha, who ruled for twelve years and died on 8th of June 1998 while in office. General Sani Abacha was an alcoholic and he kept a great many gold and diamond dollars in a private Box here in the bank here in Nigeria. The money was left there unclaimed, in the hope that one of our loyal customers would come forward to claim it. During my visit to Nigeria last year. I noticed that some of my colleagues and I have visited some abandoned buildings and also visited some military barracks where their men were fighting in the war against the native population. In some of the deserted buildings, some of the men kept gold and other valuable items which they used the money to buy foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of native farmers in Uganda, Kenya and South Africa. The Government are not aware of these transactions because they are made with the help of a Western country friendly to the United Nation (UN). Our policy is to withhold information that would lead to the actualization of these projects from the Government. This is the main reason why we have decided to help you, as a foreigner,to assist us in investing the money in your country.  Please whenever possible, please indicate your telephone number, fax number and email so that we can have a smooth interaction and also to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your country before entering into any contract.  I wish to repeat here and again,  acknowledge the receipt of your contact by E-mail and by fax. This is to enable me relate these transactions to you as a Foreigner and to enable you claim the money on my behalf. Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred to your country will be used for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity on the level of vanity. I await your urgent reply to enable me up-date you with more information and how to proced. Yours sincerely, Mr. Ahmed El Bakir

 PLEASE CALL ME FROM MR. DAVID THOMAS FROM: DAVID THOMAS &amp; CO.BUSINESS CONSULTANTS (LATEST OUT OF COUNTRIES)                              1 7802 MANGAN DRIVE,  MOBUTU -LAPIS, LEONE             7-83-81-119                                                                                          URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL,  I am writing you based on the recommendation of my attorney who has advised me to proceed cautiously because I do not know this person or have any inclination towards him. I once worked with a consultant and he was a gentleman. We used to discuss business transactions on a very confidential basis but as time passed, I lost interest in the subject and he became unresponsive to my repeated phone and fax attempts. After a month, I used my official capacity to solicit his assistance to enable me resume our business relationship. He was responsive but unresponsive at the time I sought his assistance. I attempted to contact him through my legal and diplomatic means but received no reply. After a month, I tried again and again. Finally, I discovered that Mr. Nelson Bidi died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I discovered that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Nelson Bidi did not leave any known or identifying person or company in all the official documents relating to the inheritance of his Estate. This sum of US$14M (14,000,000.00(fourteen million united state dollars)), which was generated by an Over-invoiced Payment in my corporation last years, has now been purloined and placed in the care of the tax authorities. I have therefore, made further investigation and discovered that the owner of the Company did not declare any next of kin or relations in all the documents relating to the inheritance of his estate. This sum of US$14M (14,000,000.00) has thus been placed in the care of the tax authorities without any claim of the money in the embassies or consignment and as a result, the owner and next of kin of the deceased are not aware of the money in the Consignment.  Consequently, the money will be forfeited to the care of the customs and the local authorities without any of the owners knowledge or will ever come forward to claim it. This transaction is tax free and risk free.  Please note:  The consignment is thawed and the contents refrozen in one of the holding companies in Europe.  The holding company does not know the content in the Box and the date on which the Box was shipped. This means  that the owner of the Box will not know the contents from which it was shipped.  This transaction is risk free and risk free.  Please, do not hesitate to call me on my confidential number 234-1-7755678 or use the high-speed internet connection available to you on my mobile  line 24hrs a day. I will then furnish you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the  transaction. You should provide me the following: 1. Your Company name or name of business which side of the border country you would like the box to be shipped to. 2. Your private and confidential telephone /mobile number and fax number so that I can provide you with the necessary documents and letters of administration in your  country. 3. Your good will to me which will enable me to do business with you. 4. Your age or marital status so that we can use your name and address in the  application for the transfer of the funds which will be approved by the tax authorities. Please, treat as urgent and  very confidential.  Best Regards,  David Thomas.

GOODWIN, the Chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the Federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of a company of which I was one of the few contractors that actually performed the project. The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names.  Where this fund will be transfered and how is not yet known to you. For further information please get in touch with me over the phone immediately, as soon as you receive this fax.

Title: Urgent  Assistance.
 Urgent  Assistance. JUSTIN T BELLO Capital Standard Bank of Nigeria Idumota Branch, Lagos, Nigeria. Dear , I am JUSTIN T.BELLO, the manager of bank idumota branch . I got your contact from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SECC).  I am writing you based on recommendation in my first aid kit for the Ebola crisis in my country country Liberia.  I am contacting you because of the need to involve a reputable and trust worthy foreign partner. MY colleagues and I are humanitarian volunteers from my country Liberia. We are members of the UN mission to peace keeping some place in Liberia. We are also volunteers of the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP).  We are members of the Liberia Civil Defence Force (ECF). The mission of the ECF is to ensure the survival of the country to enable the continuation of the Liberia Humanitarian mission to Somalia and to protect civilians from the effects of the war. We are members of United Nation Relief and Works Agency for Liberia (UNRWA), a volunteer-run non-governmental organisation set up by the UN General Assembly in order to assist in relief and rehabilitation in Liberia.  I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and useful foreign partner that would assist us to transfer the sum of US$7,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), into a safe foreign account. This fund was a product of a contract awarded in the program of sale of crude oil in the country. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$120,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty million united state dollars).  But in the course of negotiations, the contract was awarded to a local firm of the Russian Federation.  Because of the political crisis in my country, I decided to divert the funds for my involvement. I have worked with the UN for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as return.  I want to transfer the fund into a safe foreign account, an account that will not be traced.  I have almost resolved to give you 20% of the total sum. But I don't want to do this if I find out that the fund is actually being kept in an account that belongs to another named individual (foreign partner). I don't want to invest this money in Liberia in case of my presence on the soil of Liberia. I want to remain in Liberia as a volunteer and a par thn the land according to my agreement with my parents. If you accept to assist me, I will require from you: 1. Name and address of account 2. Your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication 3. Your confidential telephone and fax number 4. Your bank name and address in your country of origin to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made. I hope to conclude this letter with your personal information where you can send the following: 1. A copy of the deposit certificate indicating your name as the beneficiary 2. Your private and confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication 3. Your bank name and address, your bank telephone and fax number. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible. I wait for your urgent response. Kind Regards, JUSTIN T BELLO

My country is in dire need of an investment, the present Government is about to leave office with a rescript from the World Trade Organization,this rescript was due to excessive profit and  pressure from the United Nation of  aid agency (UNASIL).

I have also met with some members of the board of directors of Liberia National  Petroleum Corporation (LNPPC) who are in favour of my proposal and would enable me to transfer the funds out of Nigeria for investment in your country.

BGOH, who was  assassinated by the rebels during the war in Liberia and later by the rebels during the peace keeping policies of the Government of the Liberia  President, ROBERT G. ANTHONY. I  decided to leave the country immediately because of a problem that I and my elder brother (ABUJA) have in the last years. After the death of my father, I and my brother were living in the capital of Ivory Coast partly for security and political reasons because we were told by some officials that our father did not survive to see his next of kin (his ambassador) in Europe or America. Since the death of my father, I and my brother are now living in the slums of Liberia. Because of the situation in the country, we cannot go out at all because the authorities will not allow us to leave. During my father's life, he had deposited a consignment with a safe box firm in Nigeria for a consignment that contains the sum of US$ 21,500,000 (Twenty one million, five hundred thousand United States dollars) deposited in a secure vault in Abidjan,Cote D' Ivoire and placed that consignment in a security company for safe keeping in Europe and the United Kingdom and the rest in my brother's safe box in Europe which I and my brother are able to leave because of the security situation in our country. I wanted to invest the money in a lucrative business in your country because I am a reputable and reputable person. You can contact the security company directly, or you can send me an email to enable us start the process for your investment in your country. For your effort, I am willing to offer you 20% of the total money, while 2% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the balance 70% will be for me and my brother. I hope to invest in your country within the next few working days. I will need your telephone and fax number for easy communicating during the course of the business. I assure you that this money will be safe invested in your country due to my position as the only son and the only daughter. If you are interested, contact me immediately on my private number +234-1-7756-9079 and also send me your confidential fax number for easy communication.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,300,000.00 has carefully and precisely been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Thai Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Thai Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Clifford Stone so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that a lawyer will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of a reputable and honest Foreigner as a favourer and the legal agreement will be executed under my supervision and direction.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Title: Greeting in the name of our dearest friend
 Greeting in the name of our dearest friend Dear Friend This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have never met before.  However, it is coming from a reliable source; I have decided to contact you based on the news report of The Nigeria Stock Exchange. I got your contact address from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry where I discovered that a deceased business partner of mine, Mr. James Nimely, had left the country. He had until his death in a private plane crash landed in Johannesburg, South Africa on the 3rd of October 2003.  He died with his family on the 31st of May 2004, and the case of the missing million six hundred thalers has been traced to his South African Business Bank (S.A.B) branch in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The money was generated during a boating excursion on the 8th of April, 2000, and is presently in my branch. An enquiry was therefore opened regarding possible business associates, and among those whom the enquiry referred for further investigation were:(a)a Foreigner, (b)a South African National of Late Mr James Nimely.(c)a Mr. Richard Gubu. After further investigation, it was discovered that (a)all the deceased partners in the business, (b)all Late Mr James Nimely's listed next of kin in the South African Business Law, (c)all his Business transactions were made with foreign accounts, and (d)the money will be  lost to the Government if not claimed within the next ten official working days. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased partner, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary next of the estate. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I will then provide you with the details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because we will require your assistance to invest our share in real estate within your country.  Awaiting your urgent response.  Best Regards, Mr. Hinga Kobi

====================
From: Michael From: Mr. Michael From: Mr. Michael From ABIDJAN MOTOR CO-OPERATION COMPANY. Attention, Good Day, Please accept my apology for contacting you this way, which was due to the urgency of my request. I am Mr. Michael From, Board Chairman of Autoridad SABOT, a contract award and monitoring company based in Abidjan. I am contacting you regarding a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account in our company. I discovered the money while I was sleuthing around in the dark and I was quite certain that I had found the sum of Twenty-Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$25,500,000.00) in all the accounts of a deceased customer who died between 1996 and 2000 years ago. The company was running a capital project in abidjan the site of which is where we are now seeking to transfer the money.  The project was instigated by the management of our company to export our products to foreign countries through a sweetheart deal made with a  bank here in Abidjan. The project was completely botched and resulted in the loss of my company and my personal interest in the project.  The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$132,000,000.00 (One hundred and Twelve Million United States Dollars). But in the course of discussing with my client's representatives, I discovered that they have all been moved about in their official capacity without succeeding in transferring the money.  I am quite certain that the money will be moved out of my country through a diplomatic means, hence I am contacting you for assistance in the following three following: a) transfer of the fund to a foreign account b) the establishment of an account in a foreign country where the fund will be safekeepingc) establishment of a good relationship between myself and your country's financial institutions. As a result of this, I can take you in confidence bassically due of the source of the fund, hereby believing that your assistance will be profitable to us. The source of this fund is as follows: During the civil war in my country in which my country was involved, my boss until his death was a cooperating witness with the Abidjan Porte Police, and a government official of the Abidjan Porte Police (APPE) who was also a contractor with the Abidjan Porte Mining Corporation (ABMMC). He was a contract killer and also a civilian contractor with the Abidjan Porte Police. The original terms of the contract was supposed to be awarded to a consortium of foreign contractors of the same type but was changed to sole contractor status by my late client before the commencement of the contract. This resulted in the loss of my client and his consortium.  The original contractor has since been paid his promised amount.However, my late client before his death was the sole beneficiary of the contract.He had before him executed on behalf of his principal contracting party, a written approval from the APPE confirming his liability to the contract. However, the contract was fudged to the tune of US$132,000,000.00 thereby making the contract meaningless for the benefit of the consortium. This sum is still sitting in my account with the Financial Institution.  As a civil servant still in active government service,I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Abidjan. Hence I am contacting you as a foreigner to claim this money as I have the authority of my office to authorise me as beneficiary of the account.  I have the power to influence the person authorized to authorise the claim to come and claim the fund as I have the written authorization of the accounts owner and the account owner is a foreigner.  This is to enable me claim the money as the account owner's foreign partner/beneficiary.  I have all the necessary documents covering the account owner's authorization to claim the funds as the account owner's foreign partner/beneficiary.  I am the authorised person to make the arrangements for the payment in your favor.  If you accept to assist me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message via my confidential email account to enable me send to you the relevant information for us to work out the percentage payments for you. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the benefit of the trust rendered on you by this proposal, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you and your family, then I wish to encourage you to contact me immediately so that we can discuss the modalities of seeing this transaction through. Please call me on my private telephone number , or send me email to enable me brief you further about the transaction. I shall be greatly relieved if I have your confidence when you reply. Call me for more information . TEL: +22

I inherited a total of $20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million United State Dollars) from my late husband.The money was accumulated during the tenure of my husband as a private contractor.When my husband was on active duty, he deposited the money in a high secured security company here in Accra,Contrary to our Sharia Law, we are not allowed to have an account beyond our late husband's official one which means the bank does not know the content of this account. The Sharia Law here stipulates that once the said amount is in the bank, the owner of the account must haves been declared dead, or the account will be confiscated or revert to the government's use, and that of course means my late husband account was declared non-functional and unclaimed. A panel set up by the President (Mr.Umar Hassan) to look into the possible liquidation of my late husband account has given its positive recommendation to the concerned bank here in Accra for the refund of the money to my account within the next thirty official working days.  Given the fact that we are now living in the republic of Senegal,I have the assistance of an attorney who will assist us in claiming this money from the government of Senegal under the law. I have successfully secured an order of mandamus (interpretation of law) from the federal high court of justice, to locate any of my late husband account details, and the position of my client in his contract with Usenet.net, as a result of which my bid has attracted the interest of the (central bank of the West African currency in the europe) before the transfer is finally made final. Your positive response will be highly regarded. For further details, all you need do is to contact me on my direct private email address for very confidential purposes, or send to my private fax number plus overnight delivery. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to treat this matter with urgency and confidentiality, as we are still in the months of grace. My sincere regards, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting to hear from you soon. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Mona Alagia Alagia

I am Tony Adams, I work in a Bank in Nigeria called, Federal Government Pension Fund (GEF).I have an account opened in this bank in the year 2001 and since 2003 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is, Mr. Eric Anderson a Singapore Citizen and an Engineer with Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He died in accident. He was on a contract with Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNP). He was also a Country Manager with a Japanese Contractor. The contract was for the supply of ammunitions, hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical supplies etc for the ( five year) construction of in-house power plants in both Japan and Nigeria. The contract was awarded to a consortium of three foreign firms, one of them is a South African based firm, two are a French firm and one is a British firm. The contract was for the supply of ammunitions, hard/soft wares,pharmaceauticals/medical supplies etc for the ( five year) contract period. The contract was awarded to a Japanese firm, but after the Audit Committee hearing on the contract in May 2003, no Japanese partner has come to hand the fund over to the Japanese Government,because the contract has been drawn up and the contract awarded to one of the South African based firms. The contract has been with the Japanese for ( five years), and the Japanese have already paid the fund. The contract has been drawn up to enable each firm pay its share to the bank. But the Japanese Government has declared war on us,so the contract has been re-awarded to a Chinese firm. The contract has been re-awarded to a Chinese firm because the contract is being executed under a Chinese Law.

Title: reply
 reply Dear / Mr Takemoto I have a new email address! You can now email me at: takemail me @parks.com I sent you this information about a Consignment I have with an Approved Bank in Accra,Ghana.The Consignment is a Russian Export Certificate of deposit, and the interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. The owner of the Consignment is Mr. Karl Polanyi, a Country Manager with a Russian Export Credit Bank in Accra,Ghana. Due to the sudden death of the former boss of the bank, the owner of the Consignment was able to escape with some of his documents, which include his personal information. This allowed me to write to you with the help of God and the power of faith, seeking your help in the investment of the money in your country into a lucrative business venture of which I will be able to transfer to your account at the end of your service. When I discovered that you are a potential business man, I have decided to make your life easy with a few words of encouragement. I am Mr. Takemoto Obaya, the former Manager of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&amp;H) Accra, Ghana. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$15,000,000.00(Fifteen Million United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign Customer, a Foreigner (A Turkish) living in Ghana. I made further investigation, and discovered that the deceased had no next of kin or relations in Nigeria, and that the money was Rolled over without his knowledge or consent. This deposit was made in my department in 2001 and 2002, and last validated in 2003. No other person knows about this deposit, and I have therefore made further investigation and discovered that the deceased had no next of kin or relations in Nigeria, and that the deceased had no next of kin or relations in Ghana, and that the funds is lying with a Security Company in Europe under a secret arrangement as a Family Treasure. The deceased had no next of kin or relations in Nigeria, and the security Company does not know the content of the box that was left behind by the deceased. The Security Company does not know the content of the box that was left behind by the deceased. This is the clearest way to found that the deceased had no family or relations in his homeland, or the European Economic Area, as some of his closest relatives is still living there, and the Funds is thus floating without any claim of the Funds in the European Union, or the Bank there.In view of this, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may Interest you to know that I have secured from the probate an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to Africa and open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account, and for us to see face to face. 2. Details, particulars of your contact address, telephone and fax number. 3. Direct and private telegraphic code for easy communication. I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total money so you can assure me that this is really a good idea. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. Kindly reply to my private and confidential email:   cod_kelvin@fastermail.co.uk Best Regards, Mr. Takemoto Obaya

 FROM:MR  ROBERT  SIEGEL MR:ROBERT SIEGEL UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC LOME-JOHANNETT  REMITTED TO ME MY ASSORTS FIRST, I MUST SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE A CONSENSUS FUND FOR A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. I AM SENDING THIS LETTER TO YOU BASED ON INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE FOREIGN TRADE OFFICE OF UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA (U.B.A). I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TENDER TO ENGAGING BUSINESS. I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US IN INVESTING THIS MONEY IN A VERY BENEFIT ACCOUNT PRESENTED BY YOU. THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS MR JOHN HUGHES FOREIGNER, A CHIEF OF STAKE (THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT OF NIGERIA) WITH A  CONSENSUS FOREIGN ACCOUNT OPENED IN 1970. AN ANNUAL STATEMENT RECORDED IN 1980 CONCLUSIONS THAT SUCH ACCOUNT HAS BEEN OPENED AGAIN AS NO NEW BANK ACCOUNT HAS BEEN OPENED OR RECEIVED NEW ACCOUNT AND ALL RELATION TO THE ACCOUNT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE PUBLIC DISSENT ABOUT THE DEPOSED BALANCE AS A MATTER OF INCONSEQUENCE BY THE SENATE EXCEL TENDER. IN HENCE, MY DECISION TO WRITE YOU IS THAT I WANT YOU TO STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO THE ORIGINAL ACCOUNT OWNER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: 1. THAT IF YOU ARE  ABLE TO ASSIST US IN INVESTING THIS MONEY IN YOUR FOREIGN ACCOUNT, YOU SHOULD DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. 2. THAT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN OTHER THINGS INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTMENT, CONTACT ME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THESE REASONS SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: * ATTN: SIR/CONTRACTOR ATTN: SIR/CONTRACTOR  Dear Sir/Madam, I am BARRISTER ROBERT SIEGEL, a SENDING OFFICE OF UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA (U.B.A), I am the personal attorney to Mr. Charles Jones a Foreign Contractor with United Bank for Africa Plc (U.B.A).  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition  for you. On December 8, 2000, a Foreign Contractor with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Mr. Charles Jones an Equipment Manager with United Bank for Africa Plc (U.B.A) made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar(24) working days.  Upon  arrival of the next working day, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr. Charles Jones died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Jones did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of USD$16,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

MR.AARON W.G INVESTMENT OFFICE OF THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE &amp; RELATION.COM &amp; CONFIDENTIAL ATTN:SIR/CEO,                                               URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL &amp; INVESTMENT PLAN. Hello, My name is MR.AARON W.G., a member of the Sierra Leone Mining Contract Review Panel (SCMC) and a member of the panel set up by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Mining and Social Services to supervise the review and approval of all foreign contracts, especially those of large capital nature awarded to foreign contractors.  I got your company contact through the South Africa trade and industry, and after going through your files, I discovered that you have a client who is a foreigner (A Russian national of well to do family) and an investor in a company here in Nigeria which is a mining company. He died in the Kenya air crash, and all his properties were totally destroyed.  He has a total sum of $17,500,000.00 USD (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) in a holding finance company in Europe.  The owner of the account, while he was a national resident here, died intestate without providing any next of kin or relations.  The policy of the finance company is that such amount should be shared as follows: One per cent (totalling USD$1,000,000.00) for the foreign contractor, and three per cent (TWENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS UNITED STATE DOLLARS) for the local government and the minority community.  The policy of the finance company is that such a transaction will be thoroughly investigated and found wanting, to avoid any appearance of impropriety.  I will appreciate if you keep this business within your limits of the law as my client was a national and resident here and his death was a result of a motor accident.  If you are interested, please reply to the enclosed letter and include your private telephone and fax numbers for more details/ discussion.  I have very much interest in this business transaction, please include your private telephone and fax number for further discussions and direct messages. Awaiting your urgent response.

ATTN:SIR/CEO, I AM AVNEST O'NEILL A Government Official ,I am interested in your business transaction which involves a transfer of funds to a foreign account. This transaction is 100% safe and risk free. I will appreciate if you use this opportunity and if you are interested to assist me in transferring the funds out of West Africa into a safe foreign account, to be controlled by you for investment purposes. My name is Dr. Ives Mkize, the Director of West African Export Promotion Council (W.A.E.C) and member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Exchange Policy. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of three foreign firms in favour of the Kenyan Ministry of Mining and Resources in the amount of USD$10.5M (ten million five hundred thousand united state dollars) in the hands of the contract award and monitoring committee in favour of the firms. The contracts were all awarded and executed to the Kenyan Ministry of Transport and Communications.The original value of these contracts was verbally executed to the tune of USD$15,000,000.00 (twenty million united state dollars).The contracts were all finally executed to the original values, after which the Kenyan Ministry of Transport and Communications remitted the remitted amount to the three foreign firms. The three firms are: (A) a consortium of Mitsubishi, (B) a consortium of Vickers, and (C) a consortium of Bell Pot Plc. As a result of this, my request to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, obliging you to assist in the collection and safe keeping of the remitted funds, vested in you by the Kenyan Government, became imperative. Thus, I and my colleagues, in the capacity as members of the contract award committee, devised a fool-proof money transfer plan that was accepted as legitimate by the Kenyan Government and the companies. We seek your assistance in the following three key areas: (1) To assist us in collecting and safe keeping the funds, (2) To assist us in investing the funds in your country under appropriate conditions, and (3) To assist us in furtherance of our business plans for the funds. Your services will be needed to allow us take possession of and manage the funds, pending my arrival to meet with you. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me on my confidential fax number +4470488597, or you can send it to me using the above email address. I await for your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, Dr. Ives Mkize

Title: CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Friend, My name is Mohammed Zuba, the chairman of amaBJ plc and an auditor of a reputable bank here in Nigeria. I have urgent and  business-like business proposal for you. On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Department of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds in a bank here in Nigeria so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be kept aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:megan_zuba01@yahoo.com Thanks and my regards. Dr.Mohammed Zuba

I was married to him for eleven years, until his death. Before our marriage we were blessed with a son who was eight years old when his father was killed by a group known as the rebels during the crisis in my country. During the period of our marriage we were blessed with a son who was having some issue with my children. After the death of my husband, I and my son had full trust in God that He would one day deliver us from this dangerous situation. My husband was a brigadier in-charge of arms procurement and munitions production at the point of shipment of arms and ammunition to other countries. During the crisis in my country, my husband was amongst the first to depart the country to Europe through the help of a mediator from my country. Concerned about my child, I decided to contact you directly at the request of a friend, as I was afraid that you might assist us in transferring the sum of US$8.8 million (Eight Million United States Dollars) into your account. I was assisted in reaching you by a confidential member of the Botswana stock exchange, who is a business man in his thirties.he gave me the confidence of the Botswana Government that my son should invest the fund in your country, or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons. I and my son now plan to invest the fund in your country or anywhere in the world, because we are being threatened with being persecuted for our African identity if we invest in Africa. I will be extremely grateful if you accept this proposal in good faith. Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible to enable us conclude the transfer. Once this fund gets to you, it will be interesting because it contains very important information about you. For further instructions, call me on my private number +27-83-509-0500, or send to me through my son's lawyer email address, which I will add to your private/company email list. I will appreciate your reply and call you soon as I receive your reply. Please, treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. I await for your urgent response. Yours Child, Abdullah

Title: URGENT MESSAGE FROM JOHN
 URGENT MESSAGE FROM JOHN ATTN:SIR/CEO I am writing you for a business transfer of a huge sum of money. Though I knew all along that this money would be a source of stress and confusion for both of us because I have dealt with these people myself. I am a businessman by training and my business has flowered in the last ten years. My client, late Mr. Al Nasser, an Iraqi refugee ,officially became a citizen of Iraq through the action of a United Nations aid worker, and was a contractor with one of the government parastatals. He was until his death a ingress and egress through Iraq to China. Before his death he called me and informed me that he lodged some money with a security firm in DAKAR the total sum of USD$10 Million (Ten Million United States Dollars)in a box as a family treasure.When war erupted between the Iraqi Government and the United States of America in the wake of the change of the US President involving the participation of some Western military personnel in the removal of Saddam Hussein from office in Iraq.We were ordered by the president to  leave the country within seven days of the instruction. I was under the impression that such instructions came from above, however I found out that such orders were given only to government officials and that there was no such undertaking as 'captured government funds' as the funds were lodged in a security and finance firm with the help of an Iraqi Diplomatic Courier Service - an arm of the government parastatals.The funds were realized from the sale of Iraqi State Assets and the military budget during the war.

Title: DEAR SIR,
 DEAR SIR, From Mr. Michael Ola. Chonburi-Sierra Leone. Attn:Mr. Michael Ola. Re:Transaction/Agreement. Dear Sir/Madam, I am contacting you on a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account that I believe you will be in a position to help me transfer out of Sierra Leone to your country or any other country of your choice where we will invest it. I have the authority of my account holder (Late) who died from the Sierra Leone epidemic. Before his death he made a will and gave to me all his property, which includes his bank account, which he declared to be $10m (ten million united state dollars)to my knowledge no other person has claimed it nor will anyone ever come forward to claim it. The government is not aware of this account because my mission is not allowed by law to be able to visit the country at the moment. A company director who has been in this business for a long time and died quietly from a heart attack in April last year told me recently that the government will not allow any British or American company to claim this account because the owner will be buried alive if he does not claim it urgently. I have been told by my account director in the past that if I do not claim this account urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. If this is the case please reply to my private and confidential box: (mariama_olela@yahoo.co.uk) for further directives of how we can move the money out of the Country immediately. If you are not interested please do not reply because I do not want to make rash decision which will not benefit us both at all. Please also reply to my private and confidential box for further directives and advice. Yours faithfully MOBUTU KONA

Title: BUSINESS INVESTMENT TRANSACTION
 BUSINESS INVESTMENT TRANSACTION Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you based on trust. I am a Staff of United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos, Nigeria . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 1998, an American miner,Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$19,000,000.00 (One hundred and eighteen Million United States Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity in 2003 the account was re-directed to my foreign account and after going through the records, I discovered that his name is no longer with us. I contacted the new owner of the account, a  a Turkish citizen by name, and in writing confirmed his identity as the next of kin to the account,but found that the account owner is no longer alive. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not leave the country  until after his death.  I contacted my bank and found that Mr. Travis Myers account was not operational for five years, and I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr. Travis Myers died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I discovered that he did not leave any next of kin or relations in his confidential document with the bank, the deposit certificate for the deposit contains the same information as the account owner's name alone. This means that at the expiration of five (5) years, the money will be gone unless someone applies to claim the fund on our behalf. According to our code of ethics, at the expiration of five (5) years, the bank will  confiscate the fund and the bank will declare that the account is no longer operational.In other words, my proposal is that I will like you as an foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Travis Myers so that the fund will be paid to you. What I want you to do is to provide a safe account into which the fund will be paid into as the beneficiary next of kin. I will like you to also indicate your private telephone and fax number for easy communication and referring me to the right person in your country. I will also like you to send to me immediately your reply to my letter which can be any language you prefer. I will bring you into the complete picture of this transaction when I have heard from you. I need to be very sure and sure of your reliability before I can proceed further. For further details, do not hesitate to ask me on my private phone for further explanation, or in my confidential email address (mrnelson_20001@mixmail.com) for maximum confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to my firm by the bank when the deposit was made for your perusal. I will furnish you with further instructions as soon as I receive your positive reply indicating that you are in a position to receive the deposit. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, United Mine Workers United States that Mr.Dave Graham died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dave Graham did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of $14,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incurred in the course of the transaction.If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately via my private email and upon your agreement, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE  PLEASE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  PLEASE Dear Sir/Madam, It is my great pleasure to write you. My name is Dr. Sanni  Sabo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria's main electricity supply commission (F.R.S.C).I got your contact in good time as a matter of urgency given the volume of messages and calls I received from all over the world in the last few days.  I am a Medical Doctor, member of the Federal Republic of Nigeria's main electricity supply commission (F.R.S.C).I helped to found and was elected Chairman of Contract Award and Monitoring Committee for the contract award and review of projects in the electricity sector in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  My duties included studying the quoted data and recommendation from the commission and from the members of the public, before and after the events of 9/11.  When the commission was set up in 2001, it was to supervise the award and review of contracts in the electricity sector.  In 2002, the commission awarded a $2.5 Million contract to a foreign firm to supply heat and light in quantity and quality to pulp and paper mill operation in the Nigeria city of Accra, capital of West African nation Republic of Nigeria.  The contract was supposed to last for 36  months but was extended to 40 years on the approval of the commission in 2003.  Since then, there has not been good condition in my country to award the contract again, so the contract was again extended to include new business and a new contract was awarded to a foreign firm.  The new contract allows my commission to award a different business, hence my proposal to you.  I have studied the contract carefully and after due deliberations with my colleagues, we have agreed to give you 20% of the total contract value, while 10% shall be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred during the course of the contract, and the remaining 80% will be mine alone.  I have due regard to your integrity and honesty, and hope that our differences will be worked out in a timely manner.  I have so far decided to trust you with the sum of $8.8 Million which I have, as a private business, which I will give you 30% of the total amount, because I do not want you to be a front for any of the money when I get it.  I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free, as I have found a reliable and good business partner in your country who will assist me in investing this fund in a lucrative venture.  I am also prepared to place you in a position to request for the transfer of the fund to any account you will nominate in my country, where it will be safe keeping and appreciated by you.  I will take good care of you and your family, as I have found a suitable business partner who will assist you in investing the fund in a lucrative venture.  I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.  If you are interested, please reply to my private and confidential email and please include your private telephone and fax number to enable me make the necessary arrangements for the transfer of the fund. I expect your urgent response. Yours faithfully, DR. SANNI  SABO

Title: MATT BUNDU VERY URGENT
 MATT BUNDU VERY URGENT ATTN: SIR/CEO, I am MR.MATT BUNDU, Assistant Director of Western Union (Western Union) Asia Pacific business and finance department. This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, South African Export Promotion Council that Mr.Matt Burton died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Matt Burton did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Matt Burton so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately you Telephone number, Account Number, and private e-mail address where I can lodge your family business and other requirements. 2. I will like you to respond immediately with your full names and address to this mail. 3. I will want you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number for easy communication. 4. Send also your full names and address to enable me file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before i could proceed on the transfer to your account. Please acknowledge the receipt of this mail if you are interested. I expect your urgent response immediately. Yours Sincerely, MR.MATT BUNDU.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE .
 URGENT ASSISTANCE . Dear (Sherry) I fear that my appeal to you might be a sullen one, though I know that a parent ought not to cry out their child's name. I am Sarah Amaka ,the son of late former PRESIDENT of (UN* - South African)Victor Hugo Amakuma (Aza a.k.a Josef) and on the 15th of May 2003, during a coup against the elected government of my country, my father died along with my mother. Since then my mother left with her children (stuck) for (UNHCR in South Africa) Africa. I have decided to contact you because of the urgency of this transaction. My father was a shopper and he was also a diamond /cocoa dealer in Liberia. Before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some money (US$10.000.000.00) which he made on a business trip to (South Africa) through a diplomatic means, with a security company here in South Africa. He told me that this money was to enable him invest a good part of his life in your country. I want you to help me to lodge this consignment in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box and then forward it to you for safe keeping. He told me that the security company did not know the content of the box as it was unloaded and left at my disposal with the help of my husband's former assistant. This consignment has since been lodged in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box. However, the management at the Security Company told me that they did not know the content of the box as it was left there as a family treasure. They told me that the box will be opened upon request from me at the last. When I tried to contact my late father's attorney in South Africa, he told me that he had all the necessary legal documents which prove the validity of the consignment. I am waiting for your urgent response. Please reply to my private and confidential email:

I therefore made urgent arrangements to locate any of my late father's family or relations. A day or two later, the documents relating to my fathers investment came up as family of my late father were involved in a car accident, I was seriously injured in the incident, and subsequently diagnosed with traumatic myelogenous leukemia (T.M.L).

My mother and two elder brothers died in the same accident, and since then no one has come forward to lay claims for my fathers investment. I am making this request to you because of the need to involve a foreign partner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your help to help me to locate my fathers relatives and also to provide a safe account where this funds could be transferred into pending my own claim.

I have an urgent and profitable business proposition  for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. The nature of your business does not indicate any interest and the fund is  lying dormant in a holding company here in Karachi, Pakistan. The owner of the account,a Foreigner and a Mexican Permanent resident,banking on their Account opened in their name in 1995 and  1997 respectively. They have since passed away, leaving behind no next of kin or beneficiary that has come forward to claim the fund. The present  Chancellor of the bank is a foreigner and a permanent resident in Pakistan who used his position to launder money for his country during his tenure as a political prisoner.  I have the opportunity to make a business transaction with him,to the tune of $25,000,000 USD(Twenty 25 milion United states dollars) into a partnership investment and  subsequent sale of the part holding on the partnership.   What I wish to do is to give you 20% of the total sum, I have the legal right to this funds under the law as a Foreigner,I am therefore contacting you to assist me in  investing the money in a lucrative business in a stable country where I will visit in coming months.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  DEAR SIR,  I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia, and I have decided to write to you. The World Business Encyclopaedia is an ever-evolving and valuable resource for anyone seeking a reliable and profitable investment overseas.  In my area of Private Banking, I discovered an abandoned sum of $27,000,000.00 USD (Twenty-27 Million United State Dollars), in an account opened in 1991 and since 1993, nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that this money was actually made available for investment by a Foreigner, and that the owner of the account is a Foreigner as well.  This account has no other beneficiary and my own share of $27,000,000.00 USD (Twenty-27 million United State Dollars) sits on top of an existing account with no beneficiary. The owner of the account is a foreigner, and that he never made any investment in Nigeria before he died.  When I requested for the release of the fund, he told me he had enough to return to Nigeria for his family. But when I told him his family died, he said that he never made the family business business business investment in Nigeria. The Nigerian Government has been telling me that this man died without a family. When I tried to trace his next of kin, I could not find anybody. When I finally found out that Mr. Osi Abukarufu, the owner of the account, was his foreign partner, he told me that the money was in his account and that he had the money on deposit in the bank. I asked him why he did not want any one to come forward to claim the fund on his behalf, he said that he did not know the owner of the account and the account did not exist prior to 1993.  When I contacted the bank about the missing funds, I discovered that he did not leave a WILL. The bank also informed me that he died without a family or a given next of kin.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Osi Abukarufu did not leave any relation or any NEXT RATIO in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. In other words, if you know that you are a potential and trust worthy partner to handle this confidential business relationship, I would like you to respond immediately. Respond to my letter below (as you will be the one that will  instruct the bank where the money is deposited and how to transfer the money) and I will furnish you with the necessary documents and procedures to enable you claim the fund in our favour.  I have proposed twenty five percent (25%) of the total sum for your assistance, while 65%  will be for my family and I.  Please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.  I hope to hear from you as soon as possible, so that we can discuss physically on investment potentials, but do urge you to give me a call immediately on my confidential line 112, which is connected with international payments and financials, for further discussions and clarification.  I await for your timely response.  Regards,  Dr. Chris Wada.

Title:  
  Überhandel, 50, 713pp. Stuttgart am Main, Germany. Dear Sir/Madam,  Please accept my apology in advance for contacting you this way, which was due to the urgency of my request. I am ZAKI AHMED , a consul general with the Federal Government of Nigeria, an independent foreign trade and investment friendly country in Africa, under the direct supervision of the Federal Government of Dr. Sani Abacha (R) the former president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the influence of General Sani Abacha until he was impeached in office in June 1999. Before his removal to the custody of the Federal Government, the then president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria made arrangement with a foreign firm to relocate some of his family's valuable properties. The properties in question were: A residential complex in Lagos, Nigeria, worth (US$7,000,000), two cars worth (US$26,000,000) and a motorcycle worth (US$14,000,000) were all the way moved to Europe through a diplomatic means, while my mother and two of her children were born in Europe.      As a result of the move, my mother and two of her children were forced to leave the country for safety to Europe.     I have always loved life and since my late husband was removed from office, I have been put under strict government surveillance, scrutinizing every word I say. In fact, I have been directly targeted by the government because I am a foreigner and the reason is simple: they want to know if you are connected to any foreign partner or relation that could assist my family in the future. My mother and two of her children are currently staying in a hostel here in Europe, having fled the country due to the government's harsh treatment toward the family.    In order to enable my family to invest in a lucrative business in your country which will yield more money.    Please note that I will be grateful if you accept my proposal in good faith. My mother will be highly compensated with 20% of the total money while the rest will be for my family investment in your country, after the family has left the country. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message to enable us commence due process, as all legal processes will be followed accordingly.Please do not hesitate to call me on my direct line for further clarifications.    All the documents covering this deposit are with my family lawyer.    Please treat as urgent and very confidential. My family will be waiting to hear from you.     Yours faithfully, Ricardo ZAKI         ZAKI AHMED

Title: YOUR ATTENTION 
 YOUR ATTENTION  Dear, I am interested in pursuing a business relationship with you. My name is  Mrs. Eleanor B. Williams of Liberia. My husband was  until recently, one of the special advisers to the Liberia President, who was killed by rebels during the war in Liberia.  Before my husband's death, he made me the sole beneficiary of his separate business money, which was $12 million USD, deposited in a finance center in Monrovia,  Liberia.  Because of the war and the economic situation in my country, and because of my status as the wife to the President,  I did not want to leave my country to a more stable and peaceful environment, and so I contacted you.  To this effect, I will like to seek for your assistance in the investment of this money in a lucrative business in your country,  and also to seek for investment in your country as you propose investment in other countries as you shall advise, since we cannot invest here.  We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as your foreign partner, and 70% will be for me.  Please note that pursuant to my husband's death, all the resources of our family will be devoured by the rebels, and I fear that my life and future is in danger.  If you are willing to assist, please contact me immediately on the telephone and by the confidential fax number 234-1-7755703.  I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free, as my late husband was a successful business man.  If you are interested, apply first three months ago via the Découvrez une nouvelle façon d'obtenir des réponses à my private email:mrssosc_rev_en@maktoob.com,and please include your private fax number for quick communication.  I shall be very glad if you accept this proposal in good faith. You should keep every bit of it between us till we have a solution to our problem. When this is done, I will come over to your country to meet with you for the definite purpose of investing our share in your country, when the two of us meet.  I wait anxiously to hear from you, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity. May the grace of our Lord Jesus the love of God and the fellowship of God be with you and your family God be with you.  Yours Sincerely,  Mrs. Eleanor B. Williams

From: Mr.                         UNIDENTIFIED MALE 24 JUN 10 2001 ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Dear Sir, I am a Barrister and a member of the special committee set up by the Federal  Ministry of works and housing in the country of my  residence, which was specifically set up to rescue and  rehabilitate properties that were damaged or abandoned by the Russian army during the  civil war in my country.  I was moved into  personal involvement in this project by the ''good will'' of my colleagues. The project is  being carried out by private agreement and the government is not  aware of the involvement of any foreigner. The aim of this letter is to seek your help so as to help me to relocate and invest my share in your country into a viable business investment and residential property, which will be manufactured in your country or anywhere else you think is a stable investment. I have all the necessary documents to back up the project as stated here. I am contacting you independently of the fact that the project has been successfully completed and the fund returned to the government so as to encourage our investment in your country or anywhere else you think is a growing commercial and industrial zone in your country which will create jobs and develop the economy of your country. Please note that this transaction is risk free, if you accept to assist me, you must first make arrangements for me to leave the country and also for me to take delivery of the funds in your name. Then we can share the money. I have all the necessary legal documents to back up any claim we may make, all I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. I will post you further information's on when to expect your urgent response.   Please reply to my private and confidential email: arun_kelvin@yahoo.com Best Regards, Mr. Arun Kumar Date: Sun, 12 Oct 2001 21:47:33 +0100 (CET)  Data Type: text/plain Message-Id: greek23@direcway.com.br  Attn:Sir,                                          ATTN,                                         URGENT BUSINESS/HANDLING TRANSACTIONS:  My name is Mr. Arun Kumar. I am the personal account officer to one late Engineer Vasily Matsumoto (AY) a Russian National who until his death was a contractor with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing here in India. Prior to his death, he had taken to Hong Kong as a refugee and deposited the sum of Three Hundred and Twenty Million United States of America Dollars (US$3000,000.00) in a safe box with a private Security Company as valuables for safe keeping.   The Box was opened and placed under the custody of an auditor and after some time, it was opened and discovered that the contents of the Box was missing. The Box was opened and after some time, it was discovered that the Box was lost in the course of a shipment that was part of a logistics shipment from Indonesia to Europe.The box was registered as an "Unclaimed Goods" and was therefore donated to the trust fund for refugees here in India.   This Unit was designed and built by Russian Engineers and is currently in use by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing here in India.    The original cost of the Project was over invoiced to the sum of US$3.5Million (Three million five hundred thousand United State Dollars).    The present home owner in my country, after the death of his wife and children, left no next of kin to claim the money.Because of the way the law is implemented here, all the family's property has been lost to the government. It is against the law here to be  a foreigner or a national of any race, sex or colour. Hence my family will be interested in investing in your country or anywhere else you can invest in and as soon as you confirm your interest, we will commence work immediately followed by your reimbursement of the difference of 20% of the total sum.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond back to me indicating your interest through my confidential means immediately you receive this mail. I want to assure you that this is not a government subsidy program and that your share will not be wasted.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately

 Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Dear Sir/ Madam, I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, Deputy Chief Credit &amp; Risk Officer of a reputable bank in South Africa who specialises in repurchasing and restructuring outstanding securities. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an entire portfolio valued at US$19,500,000.00 (Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into one of the leading private Banks here in South Africa.  Upon maturity, the Funds was decleared Unsatisfied and was subsequently conveyed back to the Bank without the knowledge of the public or the bank.  Upon presentation of the Fund to the bank, the manager informed me that although the message was good and polite, we had  yet to meet face to face.  After some Googling, I discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did  not actually declare any next of kin in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to present your choice as next of kin or relation of the deceased;  if you so wish, I will introduce my family to you personally and settle down here in the United States.  All you need do is to help me clear the money in the bank and we can share the money as you please.  All you need do is to make arrangements in my home country for a business meeting and get back to me as soon as possible.  I am aware that a meeting with you will set us both apart and after due talks,  we can settle down and have dinner together, after which you can handle  the funds in the bank while I will accompany you to the meeting place.  The fee for this transaction is two million five hundred thousand United  States dollars (US$2.5M)and two million five hundred thousand United  States Dollars.  I have the funds in the bank and have ruled out any payment policy as  unworkable. If you accept to work with me, you must give me 20% of the total funds,  2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction,  3% for your personal use, and 5% for the establishment fee.  Please do contact me on my private address which I will give to you once you have offered to help. I have all necessary  legal documents that can back up any claim we may make with the  law.

Dear Friend, Compliments of the season.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter. i may not wish to disclose how I got your email address for now. After due deliberation with my son,I decided to forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I will give you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply. I am Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi, from the Iraqi refugee camp in Iraq,now seeking political asylum in Thailand. I am contacting you through the Thai bannings council. I am writing to seek for your assistance in the investment of funds which my late husband deposited in a safe deposit vault pursuant to Thai law. Whilst in the camp we found funds which belongs to my late husband which has since been released by the Thai government. The funds were all set to invest in a profitable business in Europe,I will guide you accordingly. In view of this we have decided to contact you.Please kindly acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1. FULL NAMES AND COMPANY NAME: 2. DIRECT TELEPHONE NUMBER AND FAX NUMBERS: 3. OCCUPATION AND POSITION: 4. OCCUPATION AND ADDRESS: 5. OCCUPATION AND RATIO: 6. OCCUPATION AND JOB DURING THE YEAR: 7. OCCUPATION AND POSITION:A good percentage of the total sum of $7,500,000 USD including all expences will be for you as my foreign partner. I will compensate you with 20% of the total sum for your international assistance. I need your assistance because I cannot do this alone and without assistance from someone with understanding of foreign policy, foreign trade, and able to work with both local and foreign affairs in mind. I am giving you this information due to the urgency of this transaction. Before the death of my husband, he was among the government officials who donated blood for medical treatment in Thailand. Recently, he was arrested in connection with the murder of a Thai police officer. Since we discovered that he had died, we have been expecting his next of kin to come to Thailand to claim his money or claim the money on his behalf since no one has come to claim such funds which belong to his foreign partner. We need a reliable and trustworthy person who can assist in investment of this fund in a profitable business because our local government is not competent or interested in investment of such huge amount of money. This is simple,I will like you to provide us with your company name or any name as long as you agree to assist us. If you are interested, get back to me immediately, on my confidential fax number one-800-273-8255 or email toa_k_2002@fastermail.com, so that i will forward to you the relevant documents which led to the issuance of the last of my late husband's deposit in your company. NOTE: if you can be of the mind to assist us, do not let us know that you are delaying us because we are going to leave for good. Let us depend on God that you will not disappoint us. I await your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

Title: From Mr. Al Nizami
 From Mr. Al Nizami ATTN: I must solicit your confidence in this transaction that is of mutual benefit and urgency of life in general. I am contacting you concerning a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account in our Bank. The said money was a result of a contract awarded by the bank for the goods and services supplied by the bank during the year 2004. The contract was supposed to the construction of a new steel plant in China and the actual cost of the project was over invoiced to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$130,000,000.00 (thirty united state dollars). The actual cost was US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars).  The owner of the account, a Chinese Nationality with a Permanent Address residing in the United State of America, with a Bank Name as above, has for his personal safety and the security of my family, advised against travelling out from the country for investment purposes. I have therefore contacted you to assist my family in investment in your country.  I have the possibility to invest a total of 10,000,000.00 (ten million five hundred thousand United States dollars) in your country under your proper management and care. The money will be paid for us by you after you have helped my family to secure a foreign account where the fund will be deposited, and also secured a necessary agreement with a foreign security company to provide legal cover for the release of the fund once it has been lodged in your custody. I wish to note that this transaction is risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance though,I am ready to give you a commission of 20% of the total money for your assistance, and 2% for the services of other part of your family. Finally I want you to keep 15% of the total money for your assistance, and 5% for the expenses the transaction might occasion in the course of the business.

 URGENT CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE  FROM: BRIAN FUSUAMU. PLEASE OPEN FAX NUMBER:+27-73-424-81-16 ATTN:SIR/CEO Dear Friend, I have a business proposal that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. This is not a rumour and it is not a hoax. There is a business in my country,  worth about USD$12 million (Twelve million United States Dollars)and i the owner of that business,  (A miner) in our country (U. A. E) are involved in a contract with a foreign Contract Review Panel that is due to be awarded in October 2002.  The contract was executed in 1997 and paid to our company for construction of a pulp and paper mill at our site in South Africa. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a foreign contractor to the tune of USD$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the funds was adjusted to reflect the difference in assessed value between the two contractors. We discovered in 1999 that the contract was not being paid and finally we discovered in 2002 that the contract has been pay by different contractors and that the contract has been awarded to a company wholly owned by one of our foreign Contractors without our knowledge or consent. This sum of USD$12 million has been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by the Federal Government of Nigeria for almost three years now.  In order to transfer the money out of country, I need to have  you as the beneficiary and next of kin. I have the money in a security company and this is the information that you are required to provide. I will arrange for the money to leave the country and be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition for peaceful purposes to further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. It does not matter whether you do contracting, as a trust trust is enough cause for anyone to desire to assist in this transaction. For the information, i will give you my percentage and you will give me 20%, of what you will remit to me.

Title: CALL ME IMMEDIATELY
 CALL ME IMMEDIATELY ATTN:SIR/CEO,PERSONNEL REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION I am writing you based on recommendation in the commercial bank's file. I am a Director of the Bank of the African Development Bank Cape Town South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant, i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with my government attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 7, 1997, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African   Current Energy (COREA) Mr. B. Daniel made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar   days, as he intended to invest in South Africa. Upon maturity, he sent a routine notification to my forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr. B. Daniel passed away from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. B. Daniel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million United States Dollar) was lodged in our Bank and is still in our custody. I will forward to you the relevant part of my request for assistance to you.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Dear, I am Mr Daniel Williams, a Sierra Leonian who worked with Shell Development Company of Nigeria in-charge of crude oil and natural gas. I got your contact through our country's trade and industry department.I am writing you based on a contract award of a number of million dollars by a contractor for the supply of ammunitions and other civil supplies needed by my country, my life and that of my children depends on this fund as such I must firstly seek your assistance to enable me lodge it with a security company for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since the money cannot be released to me by the security company itself. I have a contract with Shell Petroleum Corporation (SPC) and with my country's government officials to supply Ammunitions and other civil supplies for the defence and stability of a joint venture company (Joint Venture) being entered into by two European companies.The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors but in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to our by the Australian firm, hence the two contractors were awarded the same contract. The contract is still sitting in the Security Company's court after the government auditing firm refused to release the fund to us, so we are seeking your assistance to help us lodge the fund in your country for future investment in a lucrative business. Your assistance will be as follows. 1. To provide a safe account into which the fund can be disbursed since government officials are not allowed by the codes of conduct bureau to operate foreign accounts. 2. To assist us in investing the money in a lucrative business after the fund has been successfully channelled into your country without trace in the country where it was lodged. 3. To assist us in buying properties and investment in your country as you may advise. 4. To assist us in getting a good remittance from the Security Company. 5. To assist us in investing the money when you advise. 6. To help us in buying and selling properties and business in your country after we have helped ourselves to some decent quality properties and businesses. We wish to invest our share in your country as you may advise us. Please treat this proposal as strictly confidential and as such it is advisable not to reveal its content to anyone. We have mutually agreed to give you 20% of the total money for your assistance, 2% will be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will surely be reimbursed by the other party in the course of the transaction, while the remaining 75% money will be our investment in your country into lucrative business in your country which you will surely do us proud by encouraging other investors to come over to invest our share in your country. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free and the success of this transaction will be secured by your presence at the court where the transaction will be lodged and all legal documents will be in your favour. Finally, I honestly prayed that this fund would be sufficient to sustain our family since I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity upon vanity. I await urgent reply to enable me up-date you with more information and how to proced. Do feel free to ask me any question if you wish to as my husbands death has blocked every trace of this money from us,the documentations relating to the deposit of this fund are all intact with my first son for your verification .I await to hearing from you soonest. Yours Sincerely. Mr. Daniel Williams Ap- pears courtesy of Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire Country of SOUTH AFRICA Tel/Fax:229-9-23RZA Best regards, Mr Daniel Williams

Title: Delivery Confidant
 Delivery Confidant From: Mr. Micheal Ipenza. Attn:Managing Director We are currently in need of an assistance from a foreign partner who could assist us in investing and doing the business in our country for forty (40) years. There are certain numbers on an international file that if transferred to his country would make him the owner of the funds. This is because the Act of Transfer of the funds was not done in accordance with the customs and laws of the respective countries where this bank is located. The Act of Transfer of the funds was made possible when the then President of the Republic of Cote D' Ivoire, General Sani Abacha, who is currently in exile to the Republic of Senegal, made arrangement with a German business commitee to transfer out $30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United State Dollars only) from my bank here in Nigeria. This money was meant for his election campaign and the maintenance of the National Democratic party in the country.      As a public servant still in active government service, I cannot acquire this money in my country. I therefore took it upon myself to go into active business in your country.    As a matter of fact, the success or non-success of this business depends entirely on the personality and capacity of the foreign partner that comes to receive the fund. If you are interested in this project, send the name and address as stated below. I shall then furnish you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and my regards. Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

Title: GUIDE TO SUBCONTRACTING
 GUIDE TO SUBCONTRACTING FROM:MRS.AISHA MABACHA ABACHA dos Santos, Angola. Dear Friend, Compliments of the season.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good health and cash flow in the view of my new husband.I got your contact from the Central Bank of Angola which acts as a clearing and settlement centre for the foreign remittances in my area.I am presently in the Central Bank of the Republic of Angola for the payment of the foreign remittances due to the volume of payments due to different countries from within the last six to eight months. An earlier payment was made to Saudi Arabia,with deposit in my bank here in Angola, the investment of a huge amount of money by my late husband in a Country outside Angola which is now our life and our future. Please note that this money is now safe in my bank and the foreign remittance processing was very smooth. There was no risk at all as the funds belong to my late husband. As soon as I got your contact,I immediately made arrangements to have my first son up to Saudi Arabia, without waiting for the payment to come through my son. I have already met with some Saudis since I got your contact and decided on a good amount for you to handle the money and settle in Saudi Arabia, for investment purposes. The money in question is USD$14 million deposited in my bank here, which I have already paid for and handed over to the Saudi government, once the money has been in my bank, I will like you to contact me to enable us start the process of payout to you. I have already met with you and other family members and settled down in a Country in Africa with your family, and we have agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may arise during the process of the payment. I have also written to the Saudi embassies to request them to contact you to assist us in transferring this fund to you for investment purposes. All these are very important as I want to invest in a Country in your country so that you can maintain a good relationship with the security company and the Saudi government.I hope to invest more in your country so that you can maintain a good relationship with me and the Saudi government. I shall be very glad if you help me to progress this transaction.

 Attention/ Urgent(for emergency) Attention/ Urgent(for emergency) My Dear Friend, I am Mr. Iwan R. Jones, deputy senior regional manager of SEZ Bank Plc, Johannesburg, South Africa. I became aware of the existence of this fund in a safe-deposit box kept by my branch manager at the end of May 2001. The box was opened and the contents of the box lost. Since we have not known the contents of the box since then, we assumed it was lost by accident. After due deliberation with my colleagues, we decided to leave the fund worldwide for safe keeping in a secluded area as I will arrange for us to resume our business relationship when the fund has been in there for a long time. I have therefore, sought your assistance in the transfer of the fund to your account. I have the authority of my manager and two other top officials to request that you should present your self as the beneficiary to the fund to enable us transfer into your account the fund 30% of the total sum. You should furnish me immediately with your phone number,firm's name or any alias so that I can use your confidential telephone and fax number to conduct the necessary procedures. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, I hope this is the right decision for you. Please, I appreciate the urgency of this transaction. I will like to assure you that there is no risk attached. I am waiting for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Dr. Iwan R. Jones

From: MRS FARHIMAH ABACHA
Title: URGENT BUSINESS MATTER.
 URGENT BUSINESS MATTER. FROM THE OFFICE OF MISS FARAH ABACHA.   Dear Friend,  My name is Mrs Fatima Abacha, wife to the late Ibrahim Abacha, who was recently impeached from office by the military. Prior to his removal to jail, Mr. Ibrahim was a prosperous farmer/producer in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.   Before the change of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe, my husband produced and sold in Zimbabwe.   Before my husband was impeached, the military removed my late husband from office and floating my money in detention, as well as order of mncs. The removal of my late husband's money from Zimbabwe to the Republic of South Africa was effected by military means as a result of the support of the Western Union Money Transfer Agency (U.W.A) and the South African Reserve Bank (S.A.R.) (S.A.B).   The money was moved unwillingly by my late husband to the custody of the S.A.R.B. through the intervention of my late husband's friend, who had been working in the country and was a member of the board of Intergration and Accountability at the Central Bank of Zimbabwe (C.B.O.)   The money was moved unwillingly because of the political war and famine in Zimbabwe and the persecution of the Tajiks and other groups by the government of president Robert Mugabe in my country.   Zimbabwe war property was seized by the authorities and my home and office were ransacked.   My main objective is to move out this sum into a safe foreign account abroad as soon as possible for investment purposes but unforeseen circumstances may prevent us from successfully doing so.     Mr. Robert Mugabe recently made arrangement meet with Swedish ambassador to Botswana to wish for help in the transfer of a huge sum of money from my home country to his business and pastoral Africa.   I am presently in captivity in South Africa while my attorney and I are seeking for a reliable and reputable foreign partner who can assist us in the investment of this fund into a lucrative business in his home country.   We are members of the new C.B.O. and Ambassador for the Africa, and we want your assistance to help us transfer this fund into your country for investment.   If you can be of steady trust to assist us, I will initiate the process of transfer of the money to you in your country for investment.   I wish to intimate you of the source of the money when you give us assurance of your capability and reliability.   I would furnish you with more details when the money will be moved into your country.   If you are interested, please reply immediately email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction Dear Sir/Madam, I am Dr.Paul W.Durkan, the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of four large private firms in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in the Works and Housing sector in favour of a foreign contractor (American firm) a year or more ago. The original value of the works and housing contracted were both over invoiced to the sum of USD$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed the contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. In order to transfer the total sum of USD$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) into an account that we will nominate and which we will keep exclusively for ourselves. This is because our code of conduct prohibits government officials from operating or opening foreign accounts in our country. It is also to avoid any account or name appearing as the next of kin or beneficiary to any account in the world, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds to be safely transferred into your designated account. It may interest you to know that two years ago a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the Contractor and the original Authorized Account Holder to the American Funds. Mr. Patrice Miller died as a result of an automobile crash. I have faithfully and officially authenticated all the documents relating to this transaction, and as with the contracts in the works and housing contracts, we now have all the necessary legal documents to back up any claim we may make. All you have to do is to furnish me with your full name and address so that I will prepare the necessary documents and give to you the consent to claim the funds on your behalf. I wish to note that should you contact me via my confidential direct line (234)333-7661 or by private e-mail, I will require to know your name and address so that I will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will back up any claim you may make and also give you the legal documents and power to obtain the funds from the Financial Institution on our behalf. I will use my position and influence on the committee to effect legal transfer of the funds into your designated account. I have successfully secured from the probate an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. I want to state here again and again that a high degree of trust and confidence is required in your dealings with me. If for any reason you are not able to assist me, at all the involved should be very thankful that Allah has called them to His holy peace and if you wish to assist again, please do not hesitate to contact me through this confidential email address. Waiting for your urgent response. MR. PASCAL IBE.

On June 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Mr.Chioz Ugbo made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Chioz Ugbo died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a Will,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Chioz Ugbo did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.   Upon this discovery,I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to Mr.Chioz Ugbo as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds Twenty-One million United States dollars (us$21,500,000.00) in a domiciliary account to a beneficiary that will be a beneficiary of the funds in your country.   I am contacting you because of the need to involve a beneficiary in a business transaction. Bernie Ugbo has been an active member of the Board of Directors of N.P.C. for the past fifteen years and presently, he is one of the trustees of the Privy Council Chamber of the Federal Ministry of Finance.   I need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner overseas who will provide a domiciliary account where the fund can be transferred to in your favour in my country in my absence as a result of the war and other  natural disasters ravaging the country.   I will arrange for the transfer of the funds to you through the Department of transport and communication facility,I will also provide  you with the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the Fund.   I expect your urgent response as soon as possible to enable me furnish you with the necessary documents to back up the claim you will make in my  Department.

Title: Urgent  Business Proposal.
 Urgent  Business Proposal. Dear Friend, I have an urgent and very profitable Business proposition in relation to a deceased customer. This demand for assistance is made by my colleague who is a Financial Analyst/Contractor with a reputable bank in Nigeria. We have a deceased account in our bank for some time now, but we have no information about our former customer. Even after we sent a routine notification to the forwarding address, we have received no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that the account owner died without a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account owner died without a Wife or children. The account was never opened for business purpose.According to the Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5(five) working days, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. In the interim, the board will be nominating a new account holder from amongst all the existing account holders that has the correct information concerning the account. The procedure is simple and straightforward. All you need do is to provide me with your top-line (financial) statement, and I will arrange for you a meeting place and other important documents that will help you claim the fund. I shall also inform you the withdrawal conditions and the next step to take. The sharing process will be done in a very short time. Note that the funds will be shared as follows: 1. 20% of the total amount will be for you as Foreign Partner 2. 80% of the money will be for me and my colleagues 3. During my tenure as a banker in my bank, I have seen better days. If you can accept this proposal, please, do so immediately. I have more important things to do than worry about my bank balance. Remain Blessed,     Mr.   Donovan Oji  Donovan

The money was lodged as a family valuable and a matter of pride for my department as we all know that investment in your country will yield more money on the return investment than sitting on the fund.  I contacted my private contact and through the goodwill of God he has led me to believe that the only thing we need from God in this life is to give us the assurance that we shall be protected from all kinds of  devils and spirit here after. I am now soliciting for your assistance to invest this fund in your country and also for you to help me see that my family and I come to a peaceful and successful conclusion.

 James Nimely James Nimely England &amp; West Africa,   London, England;   From England. Dear , I am James Nimely, Staff of (UK)ATTOX  (Commodity Trade &amp; Exchange TB.O,   Bank Of England Plc). I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a  deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude  will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well  at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.  A Fund was open in the bank for Deceased Account, and the owner of the Account is  a Foreigner, (Mr. Perceval Cedric) a Brazilian Nationality. He has been  untill date, (A) alive, has never made his home here and (B) has an account in the bank as  a deceased beneficiary with a closing balance of US$16,500,000.00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars only) for a single beneficiary.  In the event that you accept to assist us, we propose that you provide us with your private  telephone and fax number for easy communication and beneficiary information. We shall  use our share to purchase goods and services for the project, which will be  carried out by you two, and I will also contribute a percentage of my share to your  share as you so desire. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence in  this transaction, though I know that it is against the ethics and morals of  the Bank to assist such an individual(s) in a transaction this important  for us to be honest and straightforward in our communication, though I wish to confide in  you a little more about myself and my situation. Before the death of my late father, he deposited with a  Security Company  a sum of $16,500,000.00) Eight million five hundred thousand United States  Dollars, into an unclaimed account in my name.  He had for his own use as beneficiary all correspondence with the bank, as  indicated, and the contents was decendedly delivered to the bank by a courier service  on the instruction and direction of my late father.  I boarded the cosechet with the express intention of  leaving the UK and using the money to buy goods and services for myself and my  children. But when it became apparent that the bank would not  release the money, I decided to contact you to assist me and my family.  I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased account, as all documentations will  be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.  I have all the documents relating to the account ownership and the withdrawal of the $16,500,000.00) Eight million five hundred thousand United States  Dollars.  All I require is your honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum,  75% will be for my family and I while 5% will be for any expenses that might be incurred in  the course of this business.  If you are interested in assisting my family and I should urge you to please  do urgently get back to me on my personal fax number (+4470401876) for further  discussion and clarification, this will be the better way to do it because the  time is not quick enough for a written agreement.

Before his death, he made me aware of a course of action I should take to avoid discovery by him during my stay in the hospital. He told me about a fund which was meant for our family investment in Thailand which was deposited in a security company here in Thailand in my name as the next of kin. The deceased told me that the security company did not know the content of the box which was sent to the company for safe keeping but when he was in power as a public servant, he opened an account in the company and out of the box deposited the money in my name as the next of kin. The matter is now before the court as my late husband was not aware of the content of the box when he deposited it in the company. The court will hear from the Solicitor General on your behalf as the next of kin. Please note that this is a sensitive and private matter, which requires absolute confidentiality.

We are top officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of Nigeria Plc (F.R.B.N),  staff of the  Bank for overseas customer care, our proposed business is to provide foreign customers with a reasonable assurance that their funds will be intact pending my arrival to their country for  servicing and investment purpose.  We have a customer, a citizen of the Republic of Liberia,  (West African country),  late Mrs. Amede Agah, with funds totalling $10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars). Before our investigation we believed that she died of a heart attack. We have sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but have received no reply. Based on the instructions to the contrary, I have decided to trace her relatives over the Internet, to ascertain if I can locate any of my late Customer's relatives.  I have traced all the way back to her unclaimed after her husband was killed in the E.O.C plane crash. After going through some of the files in the Records, I found out that the money may not be the only thing that is missing. There is a residue of $11M.I have sent a notification to Her relatives but have not heard from them. I will send a reminder letter when I hear from you. However, the file relating to Late Mrs. Amede Agah did not go through our normal automated records system,but went through the custom and data registry at the International Commercial Bank of Nigeria, (IBAN), and was lost in the system as a result of a system crash involving a Boeing 727-type aircraft on 31st November 2002, that took the life of my colleague and others on board. The main information that I need from you is to provide a safe account into which the money will be transferred since Government officials and corporate don't usually live here nor operate foreign accounts.

During my husband's tenure as the leader of the Gulf War, I witnessed many of the atrocities committed by the rebels and many others. During my husband's time in the office, I learnt that some of the money that my late husband deposited in a security company during the war was not actually the total amount involved, but a portion that was meant for my son's future investment in your country or anywhere else in the world. After going through some of the records, I noticed that some of the documents that was deposited in the security company belong to my late husband. After going through the records, I discovered that my late husband did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the bank. This amount of US$9.9M (Nine million United States dollars) was actually Deposited in the bank as family valuables, and the authorisation papers for this deposit were signed by my late husband's family attorney and approved by the bank board before the funds were finally released. In order to avoid any family relation from being affected by the release of the funds, I will write to- some of the family relations who will be interested in this transaction are as follows; [1] Mr. Daniel  Hosseini [2] Mr Shoaib al-Hashemi [3] Mr Nasser al-Hashemi [4] From  Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi. I hope that this fund can be released and spent in your country or anywhere else where it will be needed most. Kindly please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free (provided you keep utmost secret). I await your urgent reply to enable us finalise the transaction within a strict deadline. Yours Sincerely. Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

Title: Request for Profiteering
 REQUEST FOR PROFITEER. Dear, I am contacted via email by a respectable person who will allow me to use his name as a  relation to you for investment purposes. He proposes to  me in business and gives you 30% of the total money,  10% for your assistance and 5% to be used in settling taxation and local and  Foreign expenses. No strings attached. I contacted you because of the  urgency of this transaction. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a  foreigner with a well established foreign account and foreign beneficiary. A Fund was set up in my name in 1998 by my late father in our country into  a company that makes vacuum cleaners and household items. The director of that company is Late Al Nafaa Sankoh. He died recently without making a living. I  left the fund in the care of the bank here in Nigeria to see if anyone will ever come forward to claim it. It is  sad that this sum ofUS$15.8 million (Fifteen million, eight hundred thousand U.S. dollars) has been floating and placed  under my father's account by the bank here. I wish to let you know that all the  relevant documents to this account have already been handed over to the police and the  funds will be released to my foreign beneficiary from the bank as soon as the fund is handed over to  my government. Due to the unique nature of this business, I do not want you to know about this transaction  until I am sure of your commitment to assist me. I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance,  while 10% will be set aside  for expenses incurred during the course of this transaction and the  remaining 80% is for me. You should provide me with your company's name or any other name as long as  you will be able to receive the money in your company account in your country. I am looking forward to doing business with you and  investing my share in your country as you will also benefit from the investment. Feel free to contact me on my direct mail for more information and talking to you. Keep up the good work and continue the good  years ahead. I await for your urgent response.

Title: I NEED YOUR URGENT SUPPLY
 I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE TO INVEST MY PROPERTIES AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT PROPOSAL IN YOUR COUNTRY. I AM A MONETARY AND I DON'T WANT MY IMAGE AND CAREER DENTED. CONFIDENCE &amp; SECRECY IS REQUIRED. MY NAME IS  Mrs Farah al-Hashemi, From Sierra-Leone , Liberia . My husband was until recently, a Sierra Leone \ Colonial, but since I became ill he has forgotten all about me.  I recovered some documents given to me by my late husband from his personal safe in Madiba (Liberian) Bank here in Monrovia , and from my personal research, I found out that he died without making a WILL (EQUAL WILL) and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further research and discovered that Mr. Paul Kamara, the son of Late Dr.John Kamara a Sierra Leone who died in the war, was the subject of a visa issue by the British Embassy in Liberia before his death in the year 2002. During our marriage we had two children, and during my last months here I called the aid of my son to seek for my life, as my health was failing me. The British Embassy confirmed the validity of my husband's last statement of claim to the British Bank in Monrovia , and also gave me the assurance that the fund will be safe in their system. As such, I decided to transfer the fund to a foreign account, as the fund can not be approved to a local bank here in Liberia.  The money is in the Control Department of the Bank here in Monrovia and the safety of the fund is ensured. The Western Union Money Transter, by which I mean John Sawyer, in London, UK has designated as my foreign partner, an American named Mr. William Russell, an Oil Merchant in (Gulf)West Africa, who has an open account in (Euro Bank) here in Europe, and we arrange to meet on the 4th of July 2004. (ish)to take delivery of the consignment.  I am 44 years old, and have never been married, I am now living as a homosexual man in Liberia. I have never worked to earn my living, I am now living as a homosexual, as I have not received my pension from my country and my health has become a problem.  I have no education, I have never received any education of any kind from my father, my only education was obtained from my late father who died when I was just 4 years old.  All my life I was the only child, my mother being killed by my father when I was just 8 years old.  A few months ago, my father confided in me that he deposited some amount of money in a private finance and security company here in Europe, made from precious stones, minerals and precious stones.  He also told me that he intended to use his position to influence the people of Liberia to benefit himself and his family.  Before his death he told me that he wanted to use his position to influence the people of Liberia to claim the money, so he could send it to any country of his choice.  I am the only child, my mother was killed because of my father's desire to use his position to influence the people of Liberia to benefit himself and his family.  I did not know that my father would ever let me down in trusting his confidence, but I am sorry, I now know that trust is not weakness, courage is the one's which makes the difference between life and death. I have the strength now to face any situation as I come to it, I have come to find out that strength and fear does not belong to those that one needs to fear, kill or be afraid.  One needs to rely on one's self to face any situation as if one were in a hopeless and existential dilemma. I have overcome many adversities since my father's death, but I still have many more to overcome. I await your urgent response to my letter.  Yours faithfully,  Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

Title: URGENT  BUSINESS ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT  BUSINESS ASSISTANCE  Dear Sir, I am Barrister Shaikh, a Solicitor at Law. I am representing the Board of Directors of a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I have urgent and Reliable business proposition  for you.  On June 6, 2000, an Indian Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Petroleum Corporation,  Mr.Dwight Dike made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months,  valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my Bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.  After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, South Africa's  South Africa Institute of Mining and Metallurgy that Mr. Dwight Dike died as a result of torture in the hand of ECOMOG rebels during the war in Zimbabwe. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr.Ekotos Duncan, a foreign contractor with South African Petroleum Corporation died from the hand of his business associate on the same day, November the 8th 2002 in a similar car crash. On further investigation, I found out that Mr.Ekotos Duncan died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Ekotos Duncan did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$17,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited 5 (five) years ago. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names,account name, and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 2% will be for expenses and tax as your Government may require. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the bank's customer services officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Yours sincerely, Barrister Shaikh.

 Business Meeting From James Nimely ATTN: CEO I am James Nimely the only son of the late Mr. Steve Nimely a merchant of West Africa who died on 29th of December, 1999 in an air crash along with his wife on the coast of Cote d' Ivoire, after the couple had two children. Since his death, I have made various enquiries to various Embassies to locate any of my dead parents and this has also proved unsuccessful. After a very unsuccessful attempt, I am now determined to locate any of my dead parents. I have made some diligent searches and found the first tranche of money which my late father left behind me in an embassy vault. The money is USD$10 Million (Ten million United States dollars), and I have decided tol register it in my name as the beneficial owner to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the money to a security company in Singapore for the safe keeping of the money in a well-established and reputable company there to enable the bank to commense the transfer to your account in your country without delay and also to enable you claim the money on my behalf since I have been refused a bank account in my country. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free as the money will be safe in the security company as my foreign partner have all the necessary documents and keys to the security company in Singapore, where the deceased had an account valued US$10 Million. As soon as I hear from you, I will then furnish you with the details of the transaction. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free because I have taken care of all arrangements with the security company in Singapore, as all the documents and proof of the transaction will be with the security company upon my request. I will then travel back with my foreign partner to your country for the sharing and other investments as you specify in our mutual agreement. I will also personally visit your country soon after to ensure the transaction is completed. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above email address and I will then furnish you with the procedures to ensure the transaction is successfully concluded within a reasonable time.

Title: business transaction.
 business transaction. Dear Sir, I am Mrs Carey Zuma, from the South African re: EMPLOYMENT is a widow( 48 yrs) with two daugthers. I got your contact in our search for a reliable and committed partner who has the ability and reliability to protect our investment abroad. I must not hesitate to confide in you this business offer,taken from a diamond smuggling case in my country. This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2002,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, (being four years) valued at US$24,500,000.00 (forty eight million united state dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Export Promotion Council that Mr.Christiane Martin,a contractor with the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC), died from a freak automobile accident.Sometime in early 2003,my iraq bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Export Promotion Council that Mr.Christiane Martin, died from a heart attack in an Air Crash. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a Will,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Christiane Martin did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in mybank. In other words,the total sum of US$24,500,000.00 have been deposited with my bank without any next of kin or relations in the bank. Since the bank has no next of kin,and the law of South Africa makes it unlawful for a citizen to have any next of kin or relations. Accordingly,my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Christiane Martin,so that the fruits of this elder man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Because after all, the life and liberty is not the same for every one.

PLEASE RESPOND TO MY PRIVATE Fax:234-1-7755804E FAX:234-1-75972069 E-MAIL:(bny_sokol@latinmail.com) CONFIDENTIAL   Dear,  I am writing to solicit for your assistance in the investment of a foreign portfolio valued at $25,000,000.00 (25,000,000.00 U.S.D), which I have in my custody, since I took over the management of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) five years ago.  I discovered that the deceased ($25,000,000.00) was a customer of Wein'et AG, a leading oil and gas consulting and advisory firm in Europe, who died among other things in an Air crash along with his wife on the Nigerian Airline Rafale  aircraft on the 21st October 2000. I have successfully secured the money in the offshore safe vault of the Nigerian Government and the interest is being rolled over as a family valuable.  I would like to put before you alicia pink green energy bond which I have executed in my favour and in the interest of the good people of my country.  This bond was executed in two parts. The first part was executed in my name and approved by the board of Directors of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  The approval was given for the investment of $25,000,000.00 (25,000,000.00 U.S.D) into a government or company of our choice worth of $25 million USD (Twenty-Five Million U.S.Dollars). The approval was also given for us to meet in any part of the world other then Africa for investment purposes within five years of the expiration of the time limit.  This bond has been around for many years now and it has worked fine for us, the board of directors have fine tune and over invoiced the money to the tune of $25million USD.  I have the option to have the money transferred now to a safer location, but that depends on how much you want us to invest in your country and our cultures. In any case, I want to let you know that this is a risk free transaction as the board of directors have approved the transaction.  If you accept to assist me in this transaction, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, reach me immediately via email, by return mail and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE  ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR/PRESIDENT/CEO, URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE  I am writing to you based on the recommendation and trust you have to help me out of the money left behind by my client before the bank undertakes its business transaction with you as next of kin.   My name is Mr. Martin Blake, a Bank Manager with a Bank in Singapore.   I left my country due to war in July last year with my family and belongings, after which I  decided to transfer the money to a foreign country due to its political instability.   I have a deposit of $28,000,000 USD(28,000,000.00) in a Security Company in Thailand for safety and I intend to  transfer the money out of there as soon as every thing regarding legal and financial requirements is satisfied.   I have also agreed to give you 10% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance, in both  form of money and services. Both money and services will be performed by the lawyer as soon as everything regarding legal and financial requirements is  satisfied.   If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take advantage of the trust so lavished on you,  please respond immediately via my private email address, this is the best way to do so.   I will be very glad if you take this proposal very serious and worry free as I have found out  from my former bank Manager that there is no risk at all as the security of the  amount involved is real and a part of my motive for contacting you is because of the money which is  in an HSBC Bank Account and I want to take it out of the country because i cannot leave  it there and I also want to invest it in a lucrative business in your country as you will also be a  foreign partner in your country. As soon as I received your positive response I will let you know how to proceed. You should send me an email whenever you have a problem with your bank so that we can work together to  solve it. I will send you the bank's name and address when finalised. I will also inform you on the next steps to take. I want to assure you that there is no risk attached in this business,  as I used my position and influence in the bank to arrange and carry out this transaction in  strict confidence with the assistance of the lawyer, which we have concluded to the benefit of both of us as a  businessman and a citizen.   Please treat this matter with absolute confidence, as if it came from an orphan.   If at the end you are not interested,do let me know by returning to the section labelled as urgent.   Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested,as I will want you to keep this deal strictly confidential.   I have made arrangements with an attorney and with the security company that the money will be released to me once the terms and conditions for the release of the deposit is met.   My dear Client,   I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise due to the   traffic it contains.Do not panic,as it is not from flu or from that you have seen before.   I am Mrs.Judith Miller, wife to Mr. Martin Blake, the former Managing Director of  Singapore International Bank branch here in Singapore.   I got your contact address as a result of my desperation search for a reliable and honest person, who can handle a transaction of great magnitude involving a transfer of money to a foreigner without any suspicion from the bank itself.   I am giving you this offer, which I hope you accept it with absolute sincerity and trust.   Please treat it as urgent and confidential. I will be very glad if you accept to work with me.   My husband is presently on a trip to the United States, visiting his family's grave site, but I have decided to divert the sum of US$27.5 million (Twelve million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  dollars) into a foreign account because it is impossible to transfer it to Singapore, and I want to keep the rest of the fund for myself in a safe deposit vault in Europe.   I have applied for a security company's signature to enable me claim the fund on my behalf, but found it very difficult to get an authorization from the company, as I have mentioned in my answer to your earlier email.   The reason I want to involve you is that I have a substantial capital I want to invest in your country, and I need your assistance to help me transfer the fund into your account in your country.   I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make in your country, as you will also stand as my foreign partner.   All I require is

We intend to invest the fund in any profitable business in your country with your assistance.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved in the award and review and the relevant document covering the award and review is with my colleague involved in the purchase. Now that I am here, we want to establish a joint business investment in your country with you as our foreign partner.

Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from my  client that he had passed away from ulcerative colitis. On further enquiry, I discovered that he had  died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that  he did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents  in the banks. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that my dear client did not  declare any next of kin in all his official documents in the bank. This sum of US$5,000,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of  kin. We shall employ the service of an Accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarizations of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money will be shared as follows: 1. 25% of the money will be for you for standing in as the next of kin. 2. 65% of the money will be for us. 3. 5% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction. I have all necessary legal documents that will back up this transaction. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

TEL:+23428605018. Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mrs. Amina.A.Bello, a bank manager with a reputable financial institution here in Nigeria . I got your contact information while doing research and discovered that you might be of assistance in the transfer of funds to/from my country . I am aware of the legal requirements and responsibilities when transferring huge sum of fund to/from foreign account. The nature of this transaction is this: A foreigner an Oil Merchant/Contractor with a reputable financial institution, had a closed account with our bank here in Nigeria and in our view this account balance is unserviceable. We have addressed the account owner and have written to the same person and have written to discover if he has the correct account and no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account was not closed properly and that the account had been used to transfer money to a foreign account without a legal holder and that the account owner did not leave any WILL. This sum of $15,000,000.00 (fifteen million united state dollars) has carefully been fixed in my bank in the first instance for our own personal use while the balance is for the investment of my company in your country . I wish to transfer the money to your account in your country without the need for any trust and to continue my education. I want to invest the money for my future when I retire. I have worked here for the past fifteen years and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor. I want to re-apply for pension in your country but before I can do this I have to prove that I can offer the trust due by you and the establishment to my offer.  I have the sum of seven million five hundred thousand united state dollars (US$7,500,000.00) which I will give to you as my share when the balance of seven million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($7,500,000.00) is actually transferred to your account. I want you to immediately transfer the money to your account for investment purposes in your country . If you are interested to assist me in this transaction, please contact the firm's Nigeria branch immediately. Upon receipt of your urgent response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . I shall greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. You should contact me immediately by sending me an email to indicate your interest. I expect your urgent response. Awaiting your urgent reply. Regards, Mrs M.A.Bello.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I got your contact while doing my home-hunting in my search for a reliable person.I am Mr Syed Zaou,a branch manager with a Bank in Nigeria named, UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA(UBA).The bank is in the hands of the new civilian government and the management is under pressure from the United Nations (UN). Unfortunate situation ensued where management advised the bank not to operationalise the account to avoid it from the control of the government.Management advised that if they did not move the money out of my country it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of the account is a foreigner and a business man by name, Mr. Syed Zakir, at the Treaty made with the full consent of the parties to be by the management in my country. This account has no other beneficiary besides my foreign partner and I, so I felt it was not in the best interest of the bank that such important agreement be violated.I therefore made a confidential research in good faith for others to assist me to move this money out of my country.The management is aware of the existence of this account in a security and finance company in Europe.I have contacted you to assist in conveying this money out of my country to a reliable person who will assist in investment overseas. The management does not know the content of the account or the account owner, the management is only informed of the account content when it is in question. The management is aware that the country of origin of this money is a secret and it will be made known only to the person who will assist in transferring this funds to a reliable person of your choice overseas. I have contacted you because I as a public servant,i cannot own any kind of account,my Bank advises that i should close any existing account that has not been used for at least seven (7) years.A security company in Europe is willing to assist me in transferring the total sum of US$25,500,000.00(Twenty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) into a reliable foreign account. The security company will offer you 35% of the total sum for your assistance, 15% will be set aside to offset all expenses incurred during the course of the transfer and the remaining 73% is to be held on trust by you until we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country down the line. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the management and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

 URGENT MESSAGE FROM JEWEL TAYLOR ATTN:,                                     URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Engineer Taylor Farm, United Bank for Africa Plc LONDON. UK. 34-1-841-2207. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you in respect of United Bank for Africa (UBA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.  On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Taylor made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. David Taylor died from a car accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Taylor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the remaining 20% is for each beneficiary,whichever is greater. If you are interested,please reply immediately to my private and confidential fax number as above. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via fax  and letter mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential fax number as well.

Title: Good day
 Good day Dear Friend, I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, the Director of Bills &amp; Exchange of one of the foreign parastatals. I have a client who wanted to transact in dollars, and we agreed that the total amount to be remitted should be greater than (11) (ten thousand United States of America dollars) into his account. We hired two parastals to transact the transaction under the auspices of a consignment which was produced in the course of the transaction. Parastals are legally bound to transact business together with one another subject to the approval of the consignment itself. This transaction was successfully concluded when the clients agencies (Central Banks of the West African States and the International Monetary Fund) were satisfied that the parastals had fully complied with the terms of the agreement.However, the transaction was put into question when it was discovered that some of the parties to the agreement were not in agreement as they had conspired together to over invoiced the total sum. Consensuses were held to enable all concerned be contacted through the above email address and all agreed that the funds should be shared accordingly.In order to avoid this, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds (11, $900,000) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary next of kin. This is simple.All that is required is to make a valid arrangement for us to have the funds shipped to you from the Panama bureau foreign trade, service. Or your country of domiciliary, acting as the beneficiary overseas beneficiary's next of kin. This will be confirmed by the use of my name as the next of kin.The money will be shipped by the Panamanian trade, service. or our agency to your private or company account, where the account will be registered and the money will be paid by you in your favour as the beneficiary next of kin. Your company will then have the opportunity to negotiate a good percentage for investing in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately, furnishing me with your private telephone, fax number and your direct fax number for easy communication.

Title: Good Day,  
 Good Day,   Dear Sir/Madam, I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am writing you after a frantic search for a reliable and conflict-free business investment to a distressed country in Africa.  Following an audit by our Board in the course of our business review, we found that the money contained a hidden amount of money which is twenty five million United State Dollars (US$27.5m) in a  safe box and out of the total money, eight million (US$8.5m) is   the fortune of one late Private Banking Services customer who died on air crash in Kenya Air 27.04.2003 with other passengers on board the aircraft. The cause of death was attributed to mechanical failure.  Since we found out about the death, we have written to all our former Customer  accounts in the names he used to apply for the funds to be paid into his account, to make payment for the years of investment made on behalf of my bank by our former Customers.  As auditors, we are not permitted to make direct payments to any third party because our source of income is presently being threatened. The land problem is the No. 1 reason we are not allowed to make direct payments to any third party. The present Government is threatening to impose a tax on imports and exports and they have approved the refund of all past and future payments made to 1995 World War II veteran, Mr. Allen Zook, who died in air crash on the 31st of October 2000 in an Air crash on Air Accoke with other passengers on the flight from Kenya to Accra, Ghana. On further investigation, I found out that Mr. Allen Zook died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Allen Zook did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$27.5 million is still in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Allen Zook so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be used in the country where he died. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately, your complete contact information and private telephone and fax number so that we can arrange for a meeting point for this financial transaction. If you are interested, send to me on my fax number immediately you receive this message. The payment will be processed and the sharing of the funds then be based on agreement between both parties. The money will be shared as follows: 1. 20% of the total sum will be for you as foreign partner 2. 80% of the 80% will be our share. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of this transaction within the next few working days of our meeting. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my fax and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply.

Title: urgent assistance
 urgent assistance Dear Sir/Madam Greetings to you, I am Mr James Tegun, director of Bills Exchange Department of South African Reserve Bank.I got your contact in the course of my business search for a reliable and reputable person to handle an important transfer of fund which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. The source of the fund is a secret and it is said that only the person who actually made the transfer will get the money, since the bank do not know the content of the account.  However, after going through some of the files left behind by the deceased, I discovered that the deceased had written to me and told me that he/she had in his/her account the sum of $30,000,000.00 US dollars cash.  The deceased told me that he/she had in his/her account the sum of $30,000,000.00 US dollars cash.  He told me that he/she had written in to say that they were filing an application for the collection of the money in the name of the deceased as a beneficiary beneficiary but that they have decided to leave blank the beneficiary name altogether.   He further told me that the owner of the account in question was a foreigner, and that he should file as next of kin to claim the fund.   I made numerous enquiries to the bank as to the nature of the claim and the amount involved, to no avail. I then made further enquiries to the Embassy to locate any of my client's relatives but to no avail.   I am now in possession of the sum of $31,000,000.00 US dollars cash.  I have all the information I need to file a request for claim with the Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance.  on behalf of my client, I write to seek your assistance in the following matter. I have in my possession for a very important certificate of deposit from the South African Reserve Bank dated 3rd quarter 2002.  This certificate states that the Fund belongs to my foreign creditor.   I am seeking your assistance in the following two ways: (1) Can a foreign person acting in a foreign account operate a foreign account? (2) Can a foreign account be used as the beneficiary of the foreign account?   Please, acknowledge the receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 1.  Your full name and address so that I can prepare the necessary documents (2). Your private and confidential telephone and fax number for our communication during (a) the period of our agreement (b) the period of partnership (c).  I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance. Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct e-mail address michealipenza@netscape.net. Thanks and best regards, Mr Micheal Ipenza.

 FROM: MR/MRS MICHEAL ABBAS FROM: MR/MRS  MICHEAL ABBAS ATTN: SIR/CONTRACTOR I am MR.MICHEAL ABBAS the only son of late former Director of South African Overseas Private Banking Group (OPSBG) now deceased. I inherited a total of $28,500,000.00 US (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) from my late father which I honourably intend to use for investment purposes in your country. In view of this, I want you to assist me to transfer the money to your account for investment purpose. The source of the fund is as follows: During my father's active years in the government, he had deposited the sum of $20, 000,000.00 (Twenty Million United States Dollars) with a Reliance Bank here in Johannesburg, South Africa. The fund was a byproduct of the sales of Diamond from Zimbabwe and South Africa which the government declared war on to the farmers in Zimbabwe during the war. The government of President Robert Mugabe has been extorting money from Zimbabwe in order to purchase Arms and Ammunition for his military and political parties. In view of this, Zimbabwe's Farmers are being exploited by the government and some Major companies that control major sectors of the economy have frozen their accounts in Zimbabwe to avoid capture by Zimbabwean Mission. I cannot release the fund from their custody unless a foreigner applies for claim as next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. If you are interested, please get back to me as soon as possible to enable us start the processing of the transfer of the fund to your account in your country without further delay and please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Kindly call me on my private telephone number including the land line for easier communication and also for legal maintenance of the funds in your account. Thank you and God bless you and family.

Title: From Mr. Tami Quacken
 From Mr. Tami Quacken &gt;From Mr. Tami Quacken Department of Water Resources, Victoria Island, British Columbia, Canada. Dear Friend. I am Mr. Tami Quacken, the manager of Water Resources, Victoria Island, British Columbia, Canada. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr. Claudio Gabala, made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$29,999,999.00.(One hundred and Eighty million, ten thousand United States Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy that Mr. Claudio Gabala died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claudio Gabala did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$29,999,999.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a civil servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with  the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the manager of the bank guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. NB:If you are not interested, do not disturb me please. I will not forget your kind response. I await your urgent reply. Yours faithfully, Dr.Paul Nel.

Information Clearing House  Telephone:234- 1-775800617 Fax:234- 1- 8799055 Dear Sir, I am Dr Tunde Cole the Director of Bill and Exchange Trading Department of Standard Bank of West Africa Lagos Branch. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge amount of money to a foreign account.  During my visit to the DRC capital city of DRC, where I spent some time as a political guide before my  retirement, I discovered a very large sum of money which my guide gave me as his personal luggage with which he transported the money to the capital city of DRC for  investment purposes. The money was deposited in a security company main branch here in the country  and the money was then moved to the security company  by the guide because he could not leave the country due to the rules and regulations of the  security company here regarding the movement of any valuable or Money. The money was then moved out of the country to  a safe account, where it was  deposited with a security company as a consignment, until the end of my trip here  on November last year when the money was moved out of the country to the DRC for investment as a  result of the war and peace. During my visit to the DRC last year, I discovered that the security company that  transported the consignment to the DRC did not know that the real content of this consignment  was a consignment of $26,500,000.00 USD and was moved out of the  country to the DRC by the guide without informing the owner who is  the person who deposited the consignment in the security company. This consignment was moved  out because President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo made amends with the  former president of the Democratic Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila. This was done becaues of the same reasons that gave rise  to the new president to leave the country two years ago. The new president  is a war President and he has ordered the arrest of all those who are  close to the former president Kabila, including my own family members. The new president has also frozen all remittances  sent to the former president's family and government for the former president's family and government. As a result of this, my family and I  are afraid that the former president will behead us and take our money with  the help of some extremists in the country. If this is the case, I want you to assist us so that we can  move out of the country immediately. I have the funds in a fixed and safe  account with a security company here in the country. This account has been declared  largely full since no one have come to claim it. If you are interested to assist me  in this transaction, kindly contact the senior bank officer(s) on the phones provided to you.He will provide  you with more details when this transaction is complete.Please treat this matter with extreme confidentiality. I await to hear from you. Yours sincerely,  Dr. Tunde Cole

Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.

 Attention/'Ceo, Attention/C.E.O, My Dear Respectful, In order to transfer the sum of USD $872,281.81.55(Eighteen Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars)into a safe foreign account, which I will hereafter make available to you. I have the courage to ask for your assistance because I don't want to lose this opportunity due to lack of trust in you. This opportunity came about due to the pressure applied on me by my late father's friends who believed that I would never let them down because I am his family friend. Before my father became ill, he told me that he had a sum of seven million five hundred thousand united state dollars deposited  in a security and finance company here in dakar-senegal. This money was meant for his campaign in the past election.  My father had also told me that I shouldn't invest this money in dakar- senegal because that would be ungrateful and unkind.  I want to invest this fund in a stable economy, so that it will be safe when I need it.  I want to be very safe before I invest this fund in your country because my country is a police state and my father is a police suspect. I need your co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this fund, which I will give to you later. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to my father when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I need your private and confidential telephone and fax number for easy talking to my mother. I will give you more information as soon as I hear from you. I wait your urgent reply through my  private email address and call you immediately. Call me on my private number +234168921616 Thanks and Remain Blessed.   Yours Sincerely,   Mr.Amin Ramman .

Title: Urgent  Assistance.
 Urgent  Assistance. Dear, I am Barrister Omar, a Solicitor. I have an proposal for you. You are going to be my private and reliable advocate and banker in Nigeria. The amount in question is USD 36.8M (Thirty Eight Million, Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and I will want you to assist me in investing this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside my country Nigeria for investment purposes on the profitable investment. When the war erupted in Congo my client (A local oil merchant) was one of the soldiers who took part in the battle for the re-election campaign of President Kabila during the War In My Country (Civil war in my country) he was killed during the course of the war and my client afterwards. After his death, I and my client had a fund of about USD thirty million. After the money got to my hands, I wanted to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough out of the war zones in Africa. So I will like you to assist me in investing this fund which is a state fund in my country.  I have been in the private banking sector for 25 years.  I have a deposit on the bank and I want you to assist me and my client in investing this fund on the theory that your country will continue to be a stable and prosperous economy after we have invested our share in your country or Africa for investment purposes on our part. When the war was over and after we had invested our share,I decided to contact you with the hope that you would help us to relocate this fund to your country or anywhere safe enough outside my country for investment purposes.   As the brother to my late brother (late Major) General Sani Abacha, I am entitled to some of this money because after the death of my brother it is against the ethics and norms of the banking community to advise or assist a client who has died.   Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment since I have missed the boat on this one before.  I have an offer from you which you must consider and over-invoice it as I will take my leave immediately.  I will come over to meet with you immediately you accept to work with me and the offer of USD 35.8M (Thirty Eight Million, Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which you make us commit to your country or Africa as I have plans to invest in your country or Africa. I will come over to meet with you immediately you accept to work with me and the money.   I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. First, let me introduce myself, I am barrister  Omar of Nigeria, the only son of late Brigadier General Sani Abacha of the Federal Government who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active duty as a soldier during the war in my Country(civil war in my country). I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contract executed by a consortium of foreign banks in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the supply of contract goods and services. The original value of these contracts were DELIBRATELY OVER invoiced to the sum of USD$34,000,000.00 (thirty-nine million, two hundred thousand United States Dollars). This amount was duly supplied by the consortium banks to the tune of US$9M (one hundred and eighty thousand united states dollars). The original contractors have been duely paid by the consortium banks, but the firms that actually executed these contracts have been unclaimed. As a result of this, the present Government is planning to collect a total of USD$26,000,000.00 (twenty-six million, nine hundred thousand united states dollars) from the firms that actually executed these contracts. As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Nigeria.    Accordingly, my present financial resources as a civil servant is not sufficient to cover the payment of these outstanding bills in my favour.    Therefore, in order to enable me present your bank as a beneficiary of a contract that has been awarded and executed by your company, I propose I seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, to enable me transfer the excess amount to your account in your name. Then I will come over to meet with you in your country or Africa.    This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If you accept to assist, I want you to state how you wish us to share the money in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If this proposal satisfies you, please respond immediately via my private email address. I will keep you informed as soon as I receive your response.    Keep in touch with me through my

My husband was until recently, one of the personal aid to the president of Liberia, Dr. Charles Taylor until his death last year. Before my husband was his aide, he was an oil merchant in Monrovia,  Liberia, until his death. Before my husband was his aide, he was an Oil Merchant in Monrovia,  Africa.  When the war broke out in Liberia, my husband and my elder son were riding in front of our hotel from Port-Santo-Cote d' Ivoire to Bulawayo, ZIM, to look for work. My husband was among the first to go to war-torn areas to look for a safe haven from the bombing and the burning of our homes.  After the war broke out, I and my son were sent to war-torn areas in Liberia, where we are now. After the death of my husband, I immediately called up the Foreign Exchange Department of my Bank and made arrangements to move my family wealth and personal effects out of Liberia. I have secured an investment license and am now looking forward to investing the money in your country or anywhere that you will support me.  Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message indicating your interest.

Title: URGENT  ASSISTANCE  PLEASE  GET BACK TO ME
 URGENT  ASSISTANCE  PLEASE  GET BACK TO ME Dear Friend, I know the necessity of urgent action will win confidence from you. Unfortunately the present Management of Sierra Leone mining Corporation has terminated all our relationship with the previous one who had taken over since he was recently impeached. This is because he and his family were accused of involvement in a contract payment fraud.According to the charges, he and his family with their family with an amount of $31,500,000 USD were accused and found guilty. The mining corporation has ordered me to reimburse them the full amount, which will be mine in my defence, because my bank has stopped disbursing our deposits.I have incurred all the expenditures as a result of the war and the suffering we have gone through as a people. My husband and I are members of a special committee for reconstruction of Sierra Leone mining area, and the charges were moved to the hearing stage in the camp to try to help those that were being oppressed by the rebels. The situation is very serious.I and my son have decided to leave the country and seek for asylum in Europe through the United Nations High Commission for asylum seekers. My son is 25 years old.I am presently in Greece by permission of the Greek authorities because of the war and political crisis in my country. I have a substantial capital of 20 million dollars, which I intend to invest in your country or anywhere in Europe under your control. I have therefore, been delegated by my lawyer to seek your assistance in the investment of my share in your country into a very lucrative business venture. Wherever possible, please do give urgent assistance to my family and my son. If you are willing to assist, please contact me on my confidential fax number +27 83 410 2506 x105.I will please include your private/company telephone and fax number for easy communication. I have compatible accounts in both the European and Asian central banks. If you are interested, my son and I will visit your country soon to ascertain the legal structure of the funds, which will enable us invest it in your country under your control.

This proposal is the product of our private trial and it came to our notice that neither the  previous administration in the country, nor the management of our last political candidate for president,  ever nominated any foreign partner to provide financial and non-residential support to the campaign.

To commence this transaction, I want you to provide immediately your telephone number, full names and address so that we can arrange for our bank to release the funds in your name. I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss physically on Investment potentials. Based on this we have already agreed to share the funds 30% of the total sum; while 10% will be for you as beneficiary and 2% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the remaining 70% belongs to my children. I want to assure you that this business is risk free because I have exhausted every legal avenue in this regard.

During my visit to South Korea in January 2004, I used the opportunity to solicit for your assistance in the transfer of a sum of $22, 5 million US dollars ( Twenty two million, US) into a safe foreign account.The money was deposited by my late father in a blank financial management company here in Korea , and in January 2004, we were allowed to come over to South Africa to invest the money in any profitable business as long as we maintained good relationship with the Korean government. At the time of his death, my father had taken to Johannesburg, South Africa to embark on a business venture with my mother, which we successfully concluded in June of 2004. At the time of his death, the South African banking ethics and laws did not allow the release of the fund to any account without a legal owner and legal beneficiary.I have successfully arranged all the documents to put you as the legal beneficiary of the fund, with all the documents covering the deposit that I have made with the South African banking ethics and laws, and I will furnish you with the relevant documents to your account. I have also mapped out 5% of the total sum for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the course of the transaction, and I will guide you accordingly according to the instructions of the fund.

 Business Investment / Capital Gains FROM:Dr.Irma al-Fayez;_
 ATTN:Permit me to ask a question which may be of interest to you and interest to others as well.I am Dr.Irma al-Fayez, the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts in place in my country including those of the construction of power plants, which were all awarded to a consortium of foreign firms. The original value of these contracts were carefully negotiated and approved by the federal government of Nigeria, with the assistance of foreign firm. The original value of the contracts were determined to be over invoiced to the sum of USD$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). This amount has now been revised and approved by the federal government of Nigeria to a new award price of USD$21,500,000.00 (seventeen million united state dollars). As a result of this, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. The federal government has since suspended all the contract funds that were originally assigned to the foreign contractors involved in the projects, as the foreign contractors have expired their expiry date and the projects have been completed. Consequently, the suspended funds are being sought by some of the foreign contractors, who are presently seeking to transfer the funds out of the (West African)Union, because the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) has now extended the expiry date of all the suspended funds.As a result of this, many of the suspended funds are being watched carefully by some of the foreign contractors, who are presently seeking to transfer the funds into their accounts. Those funds are presently in my bank and the present holder of the account is Mr. Mustapha Okocha, an Iraqi refugee, who used to work with Shell Oil Development Company in Iraq, as a contractor.This means that the federal government of Iraq has placed an order for my assistance to transfer the funds out of Iraq, and I am willing to assist them in this transaction. All I wish to do is to provide a safe account into which the funds will be transferred since I have no idea as to what may be the true value of the funds. All legal documents to back up your claim as the beneficiary of the funds will be carefully worked out and you will meet me in person in a few days to take the funds to your country for investment purposes. The transaction is completely risk free with your percentage remaining to guide us on investment in any profitable business. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance, so that you can use part of it on investment in your country. Be rest assured that this business is risk free because I have worked out all modalities for the smooth smooth exercise of the deal. I will greatly appreciate if you take this deal seriously considering the confidentiality in this transaction. I shall be very glad if you accept my proposal in good faith, though I may not be able to persuade you otherwise due to the nature of my position as a commissioner of the civil service law. Feel free to call me on my personal line for further talks. or you can always give me a call on my confidential line as soon as you receive this message so that we can go ahead to conclude the transaction without further delay and satisfaction. Thanks and God bless you for your anticipated understanding and co-operation. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall be giving you all the ammunition for the transaction in due course. Expecting your urgent response. Again, call me on my confidential line immediately, and leave a brief message for further discussions. Best Regards, Dr.Irma al-Fayez

I went through the records and discovered that the account was originally intended for a deceased beneficiary who died intestate without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account was never operated or claimed by any person but myself.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account was never operated or claimed again. The owner of the account died without a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction Dear Sir/Madam, I am Barrister Justin Lewis, the personal Attorney to Mr. Steve Roper a national of your country, who used to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company in-charge of crude oil. There was an invoice for the transfer of US$18,500,000.00 (18,500,000.00) into his account, but on the instruction of my late client's next of kin, the fund was changed into a foreign account without his knowledge or consent. Upon maturity in 2002, the amount was re-advised and sent back to the original sender account unclaimed. In 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace a reliable person over the Internet to locate any member of my family but of no avail. After a month, I discovered that Mr.Steve Roper did not leave any next of kin to claim the money. I therefore made further investigation and found out that Mr.Steve Roper did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for, that he executed was his entire life's work. The document states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of the deceased so that the bank will transfer the money into your private or company account. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of his last statement of account issued to him when the deposit was made for your perusal.

Title: URGENT INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP.
 URGENT INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP. From:Daniel Wilson      Urgent and Positive Attention,   Dear,   This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have not known or met before. However,  it really is of importance to  you because of the information I am about to reveal to you. My name is Mr. Daniel Wilson,  a member of the State CAC of Cote D'Ivoire,  and a business man before my  son was born. Before my son was born, he told me that he discovered that there was a  floating fund in a security and finance company in Dakar,Senegal. The fund was discovered and appraised at $11.7 million dollars and it is still lying with the firm.  My son told me that the money is still in the SECURITY COMPANY and he is allowed to come to  Senegal to make claim for the fund because he is a national of the Republic of Senegal.  But, before my son was born, he told me that he discovered that I  never knew him and that he and his mother died in a car accident.  So, one more thing before my son grows up,I want us to invest this money in your country or anywhere  save enough outside Africa for security and political reasons.  I am not afraid of losing my life as a result of this. I know that you will never let me down in this. Now that I'm  born again Christian,I want to die a living death since I have come to  find out that there is no resurrection. I believe that you will never let me down in this business.  Let me start by telling you the history of this fund. When my son was about 4 years old, he told me  that he found some money in the security company vault and that he is the only child that  he has. He is allowed to come to Europe to make claim for this money because he is a  national of the European Union (EU). I was very sad because I know that this money will be very  difficult for me to get out of Europe because of the EU's governance and law in every  part of Europe. But, I was aroused when my son told me that he found the money.  I immediately went to the SECURITY COMPANY and told them about my son.  I told them that he found the money with the help of a special envoy and the leader of another  foreign company from the United States, who are part of the same foreign aid program as my son.  I also told them that the United States cannot release the money because it is contrary to our  Laws and Charter.  All this was done in absolute confidence that they will never let me down.  I have worked for four years as a private contractor and I am  safe now because of my position and because of the positive response I got from the SECURITY COMPANY.  I am now a new Christian convert, and the Angel of Christ (Mark 10:10  says that he will never leave my house, I have received a powerful desire in my life that I cannot explain,it is a  soul calling and it demands a high level of trust and confidence.  I am seeking your help in investing this money in your country or anywhere else you think is a reliable and God fearing area, with your help and assistance.  In brief, I have USD$15 Million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) that I want to invest in your country or anywhere else you think is God fearing, and I need your assistance to invest and study this money for  investment purposes in your country as soon as your prayer is heard. I have direct telephone communication with the Angel of Christ, He will come and  visit you in person or by telephone and he will direct you how to the investment.  For your assistance, I will give you 20% of the total fund.  2% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the course of this transaction, the balance  will be for me.  Please note that this transaction is risk free, the only risk is from you refusing to receive the deposit as you have told me before that you will never let me down in this business.  I await your urgent reply so that I will give you the contact details of the Financial Dispute Committee and the Angel of Christ so that you can reach him immediately.

 URGENT  PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE ATTN:TO BE REPLAINED BY   NAME:JOHN                                Greeting, This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have not met before. But I believe it is one day that you get to know someone for life.  I am a citizen of Republic of Liberia, and the only son of the late Dr. John E.  JOHN   KABILA. I am writing you in respect of my right to assistance in a business transaction, though we have not met before but I firmly believe that one has to confound forces to succeed in life.  My father was a prosperous Gold and Diamond merchant in Monrovia,capital of the Republic of Liberia, before he died in the year 2004.He was a very good friend of the former president Charles Taylor . Before his death, he secretly disclosed to me some of his money which was totalling about $12 Million US Dollars (Twelve Million United States Dollars) in a security and finance company in Senegal, Africa , before he was picked up and sent to the detention facility here in Dakar. I have been in detention here since January, 2006 and I never knew my father was going to die. He confided in me while in detention that he had secret accounts and safe houses in the countries over there , which he set up in Mauritania , Uganda and Senegal for the deposit of the money in certain safe accounts. After my father's death, I decided to search for a reliable and trust worthy foreign partner who would assist me to move this money out of Liberia and the countries over there because the West African and Asia economies are wrecking. I want you to assist me so that we can transfer the money to your account for safe keeping.  I have all the necessary information for you to contact me on my Nigerian and I have all the documents covering every deposit and every withdrawal for your assistance. the only thing you have to do is to provide a safe account where the fund will be safe invested and you will also come to my aid when needed.  I have all the necessary documents for you to contact me on my Nigerian and I have given the order to the security company to provide the account to you as soon as you receive a reply indicating that the account has been dealt with the right way.  I am waiting for your urgent reply. Yours faithfully PRINCE JOHN NELSON

Title: Very Urgent
 Very Urgent DEAR SIR, I am DR David Rawlings, of the Medical Group in the Department of (Central) Bank of Nigeria (British West Africa) .I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts in place worth over ($10,000,000.00) awarded by a consortium of British and US Governments between 1997 and 2001 for the supply of Amalga (mainly rubber) products for the construction of hydroelectric dams and ports in India and Africa, as well as for purchase of raw materials for N.N.P.C. (National Petroleum cooperative).The original value of these contracts were carefully negotiated to be based on the law, as every measure was taken to ensure that the projects were actually delivered. But in some cases where the original contractors have been fully paid and the projects actually commissioned, the original contractors refuse to transfer the money to another account. Hence the matter is now referred to be for us to award a new contract in their favour, if not already in operation. In order to avoid this, some of the projects that have already been successfully commissioned will be re-commissioned with a different contractor, this time with the correct information concerning the money as the beneficiary. I have authority (directive) from the board of directors of the N.N.P.C. (National Petroleum cooperative) to authorise the transfer of the total sum into your account, provided you are capable and willing to handle such enormous amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because of the need to ensure a smooth transfer of the funds to your account. It may also be beneficial to arrange for us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement that will bind us together so that you can receive the money in cash from the recipient country pending our share being calculated. I have the authority of the board of directors of the N.N.P.C. (British West Africa) and the director of the contract award and monitoring committee (of the consortium British consortium) to authorise the transfer of the funds to any of the beneficiary accounts on your behalf. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Otherwise, remain as unreachable as possible. Endeavour to provide me with your name as the beneficiary of the funds. I have other ideas on how the funds will be transferd and besides, I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free as the authorisation is validated from the Board of Directors of the N.N.P.C. (British consortium). I will set aside 10% of the fund (ten million united state dollars USD$10,000,000.00) for you as beneficiary. I will make sure that the fund (US$10,000,000.00) get to you in due course. I will also visit your country for disbursement of the remittances and share capital. Your share will be 30% of the total amount, 60% belongs to us. The foreign contract award monitoring committee are with the assistance of the auditor and the auditor general of the N.N.P.C. (British consortium) are with you in this transaction. Please keep this transaction absolutely Confidential. Yours faithfully, DR. DR. DAVID RAWLINGS.

Title: URGENT  ASSISTANCE
 URGENT  ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am writing you based on the belief that you will be of great assistance to me. I am a Barrister and have prepared an account in a Bank here in Trinidad and Tobago for the payment of the said large amount of money to any person that comes forward to claim it. On the 21st of April 2000, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum Corporation, Mr. John Allen made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-one Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum Corporation that Mr. John Allen died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John Allen did not declare any next-of- kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

 Consider This Transaction Request &gt;From the Desk Of: Mr. Arif Shaikh Arabian Bank Co.Ltd, Abidjan -   Birmingham  -  Gulli-e-Chitwan Bay Emirates Abu Dhabi     Dear Sir/Madam, I know you will be surprise to read from me, more so when it come from a stranger. However,bey my humble request and let me first introduce myself to you. I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, an auditor with Arabian Bank Co.Ltd.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1999 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with Arabian Bank Plc. and his present balance is valued at  $41,500,000.00 USD (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account matured, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr. Travis Myers died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of $41,500,000.00 USD is still sitting in my Bank and the principal sum is being rolled over at the end of every year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to country law, at the expiration of 5 (five) working days, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as Mr. Travis Myers's next of kin.  This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately you telephone number,full and accurate bi-lingual names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for Expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.  There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Demystified request for assistance number: (010) 623 539, Private  Phone , Fax : (011) 517 649, Direct:+24-70-53-683-958  ATTEN:THIS E-MAIL PRIVATE AND SECRET. FROM THE DESK OF DR.HANS ASST. DIRECTOR BANK OF AFRICA MOHAMMED Bamba, D.D. Cameroon, 14-1-2004. Dear Sir/Madam, It is my great pleasure to write you for assistance in the matter stated below. My name is Dr. Hans Asst., Director, Bank of Africa (BoA), Nigeria Branch, United Bank for Africa Nigeria Plc (U.B.N). This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2001, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Bamba Yukune made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar  months, valued at US$21,000,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Bamba Yukune died from an automobile accident. On further inquiry, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Bamba Yukune did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account.

ALABAMA: STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ATTN: CEO  I am Dr. A.Uba.Man.A, the director of Sales and Marketing Department at one of the leading automobile parts retail chains in the country of Zimbabwe. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of cash to a foreign account. The source of this fund is as follows; There is an outstanding contract payment from the Defence Organization for the manufacture of the Contra-Camo armor sheets for the M.G.B.C. This contract was originally awarded to Western country by the Zimbabwe Defence and Industry Ministry but has since been paid to any foreign contractor as ordered. The contract was supposed to be awarded to Russian firm but was instead given to Chinese firm which has since been paid by the Zimbabwe Defence and Industry Ministry. The design of this armor is to provide a highly mobile, self-propelled and self-protecting platform for the M.G.B.C. which includes artillery and anti-tank weapons. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and the cost has been reduced to the tune of US$96.3 million (Ninety nine million united states dollars).  The contract was supposed to be remitted to your nominated account but instead has been sent to the account of a Chinese firm with any remaining balance left over as spent parts. The Chinese firms inability to provide the missing parts has become a matter of public record. Consequently, the heads of the foreign countries which supply the military equipment to Zimbabwe have in the course of numerous trips to China sent a routine notification to all of them to indicate the nature and amount of their expected shipments, which they have duly done, the heads of the foreign suppliers have now forwarded to me. I am awaiting your urgent response. Yours faithfully, DR A.Uba.Man.A

Title: Urgent  Business Proposal.
 Urgent  Business Proposal. Dear Sir/Madam, May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and appropriate shares accordingly. We are senior managers of a nationally known credit institution, we have a customer, a consultant and a foreign partner who are international private banking super customers. Our bank recommends a sum of $30,000,000.00 USD (Thirty million united state dollars) be put into a designated foreign account. The account is currently in the hands of the Australian Federal Government and the New Zealand Government.The Australian Government has given approval for the export of crude oil which we consume, so our advice is to use this opportunity to please our international partners as well. This advice is given in view of the fact that we are in a financially stable position, the increased scrutiny and regulation of our foreign policy and economy in the light of our present position as a nation, and the fact that our foreign account has been frozen three times already this year. We recommend that you please, in return, you should help us transfer this money out of our country. The agreement between my country and the Federal Government of Australia governing cooperation for the supply of raw materials for industry and agriculture has been fully implemented, hence our client has ceased to be a customer and we as a government is not allowed to do business with him. This agreement has been approved by the courts and the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. The Federal Government has given notice to our international business partners to cease and desist from operating any foreign accounts, we are the only ones that remain to receive the money.We have complied with the request and have ceased operations. The money will be remitted into a designated account of ours, all other related documents and legal documents to enable us file application for payment in your country for the claimed period. The whole procedures have been perfected to ensure a smooth operation and a risk free transfer. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above email address so that I can furnish you with the relevant details to this transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. Awaiting your urgent reply.  James Nimely

This is to help  him prepare for the investment and the related taxes that would be required  in your country . My client was a merchant and importer/exporter of Gold and Diamond into/from West Africa between 1991 and 1997. He died after a fatal car accident with other passengers on the M/MA-90 I drive.  During the study I did on his death, I discovered that he did not leave a WILL and other relevant documents with him.  When the study was finished, I sent a routine notification to his last known address but got no reply.  I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that he did not leave any next of kin or country of  origin for the funds.  I have sent a reminder and finally found out that he did not leave any next of kin or beneficiary  in all his official documents with the bank.  I have the funds in the bank and I am prepared to pay out the entire sum to any person that comes up as the next of  kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.  I am contacting you based on the same guidelines as my client did. In particular, I want you to come to our bank and claim the funds on our behalf since we cannot afford  the expense ourselves. I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance. If you are interested, contact me immediately via email or fax on234-1-7755607.

Because I need your assistance to help me to invest this money in a profitable business. This is because I want to leave the country due to political war, natural disaster and other social problems. My husband is from United States and we lived here before we were separated because my late husband was killed during the Gulf War. We separated following the death of my husband because my late husband is from United States and I don't want to take any more child from her father. I don't want my husband's relatives to know that my husband is separated from me. As a result of this, I don't want my late husband's relatives to assist me. So I don't want you to help me to get the fund out of the bank. Please, I want you to state how you wish the fund to be conveyed to you. State your own contact telephone number and fax number so that we can discuss the modalities of your assistance. I will give you all the clearance necessary to make the fund available to you as the foreign partner to receive the fund.

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction ATTN: PRESIDENT/DIRECTOR, I have an urgent and very profitable business proposition  for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. This is simple; On June 6, 1998, an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Marshall made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for the duration of twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Marshall died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I discovered that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Marshall did not declare any next-of- kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$14,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Marshall so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple; I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, send the above information as stated below, including your private fax number and confidential e-mail address so that we can have more confidential correspondence. (jk_kono@fastermail.com) I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free as all the arrangements made for the successful execution of this transaction have been made. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Best Regards, Mr. Kamal Abdullah KCFO FAS/C.E.O

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction Dear Friend, I am Joe Gilbert, the Assistant General Manager of Con Edison Nigeria, the electricity monopoly agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, and the managing director of South African Resources, Inc. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,where there were amounts to be paid and the trust reposed on you at the end of the transaction should be commended. There are certain amounts to be paid into your account from a contract executed for and awarded by me and my colleagues for the supply of power and related projects in your country,by the power company of the Federal Government of Nigeria under contract number GRC-94-07/CTAP-U. The contract was for the supply of 40% of the total contract amount to the foreign contractors,that includes you, but not all the contractors. The original contract was for the supply of power to the power company for the power block area until the end of the current contract in 2002. After the provision of power to the contractor,the contract amounts were increased to the tune of US$40.8 Million (forty Million United State Dollars). This increased contract amount was then sent to my tender ­ offer on the table for a contract that the power company of the Federal Government of Nigeria would supply the power block area to the extent that the contract amount is satisfied. The contract was then submitted back to the power company for reimbursement to the original contractors. When the offer was made known to the contractor, he immediately contacted his foreign partner to whom he had entrusted the payment of US$20.7 Million for payment in the USA,he then lodged the money in a security company for safe keeping. The security company did not detect the actual content of the box when it was sent to the security company as a personal family treasure. The security company did not know that the content was actually a money order signature confirmation from my office which I signed personally by me and my colleagues on our behalf. This transaction was then officially concluded between the power company of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the security company with the money order signature confirmed in my office. I have officially been promoted to the position of managing director of South African Resources, Inc., as a result of the increase in the contract costs and the reduction in the Board member representation to less than 1% of the total number of Board members. This change in the Government has resulted in a relaxation of our self monitoring procedures,which has led me to believe that the money may be released to any foreigner that comes to claim as a next of kin. If you agree to assist me in this transaction,you can contact me as soon as you receive this message through my email account,or you can continue to the next step of the process i.e mail to ask the question,which will be incorporated into the contract we will sign when this fund reaches your account.Please keep in mind that I have ­ every necessary information to back up any claim we may make with the security company. Please kindly reply to my private and confidential email: je_gal_02@yahoo.com with your urgent response. Best Regards, Joe Gilbert

The original value of these contracts was (UNTIL NOTACED ARRANGEMENT) set by the United Nation (UN) General Assembly in its resolution adopted on June 6, 1998 at the request of the Nigerian government. The contracts have been fully executed and the companies are now  operating under different names and different code of conduct. The contracts were supposed to be awarded to a consortium of three foreign firms but instead the contract was awarded to a single firm, which the Nigerian government has now decided to award to us. The original contract value was supposed to be US$14,500,000.00 (fifteen Million five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) but the Nigeria government has now changed the code of conduct code to reflect that this money has been spent unclaimed and that the funds belongs to us. As civil servants, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable us transfer the said sum into an account you control in your country, where we believe it will be safekeeping for the funds. We are now in possession of the sum of US$14,500,000.00 (fifteen Million five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) as well as some valuable identifying information about you that will enable us write a simple cheque transfer to your account.  All we need from you is to do all you can to help us to get the funds transferred into your account in as timely a manner as possible. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact us immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more information and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply.  Best Regards, Mr.Frank Mobe.

 GOOD DAY SIR Dear good friend, I am Mr. Micheal Ipenza, an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am writing you based on recommendation in the business world.   I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of three payments made to a security firm by a  consortium of four large banks in the form of checks payable to be claimed by the end of March 2003 to a consortium of companies in the form of  two dozen individual account open (non-residents) that ranged in value from $15,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00 (fifteen Million united state dollars) into nominated accounts belonging to various foreign account holders without any apparent relationship whatsoever. The original companies that made these payments were: London &amp; London Securities, Lloyds TSB, HSBC Holdings plc, HSBC Private Banking Services, HSBC Private Banking Services, &amp; British Airways Private Banking Solutions, made the above payments to our private banking division and unclaimed funds is being rolled back by British Airways to the tune of US$15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million United State Dollars). This was the final payment from the original companies for the work done by the consortium members during the period of time the payments were made.   There has been no documentation showing the existence of the funds in the custody of the companies, the funds were first coded for safe keeping by the British government during the period of time the payments were made and once coded, the funds are fenced into two trunk boxes which are then sent to our company for safe keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim the money as the funds have been coded for a particular amount.   This is the situation , all attempts to track the money has hit the stones in view of our position in the company, we are the only ones that have the actual content of the boxes which are then sent to our company for coded funds.   The person in charge of the payments is a retired Colonel (dr) who has been retired for many years. He has an unconditional trust in my ability and sincerity to handle this transaction in good faith and God fearing that we shall make good friends by sharing the love of God within us.   For the love of God, I must let you know that this is the only faith I have, and the only way I can ever really serve the Lord. This is the only hope for my life.   If you know that you are worthy enough to make this request to receive the money in money,l will be willing to offer you 30% of the total sum, I have put money aside to start a good association of Christians in your area, I have also written to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the President of the Anglican Church in India (A.C.E) to encourage more churches to donate to the relief effort in Iraq and Syria, I have also appealed to all Christians to convert to our cause and to help those in danger of dying because of war, I want you to visit Iraq and Syria and see for yourself. I want you to help out with whatever you can do to help those in need. If you are interested, contact me immediately on my answering machine or fax:234-1-7755809,and please include your personal telephone and fax numbers. I will then forward you the text of my request to you.   I hope this is the best way to help you.   Yours Sincerely, Mr. Micheal Ipenza. E-mail:mike_ernest@maxmail.com

DIRECTED BY: MRS CYNTHIA CAMARA. DEAR SIR,  SIR, Greetings from London,  I am very sorry to bother you with this correspondence, though I got your contact through the London Free Trade Zone Information Exchange (L.F.T.I.E) and also by chance,when I was searching for a reliable person to handle a very confidential Transatlantic Business transaction. I am writing to you in respect of my desire to invest in your country into a very lucrative business venture of which you are to advise and execute the said venture over there for the mutual benefits of both of us.  I am writing you because I discovered your contact through the London Free Trade Zone Information Exchange (L.F.T.I.E) while searching for a reliable and very profitable foreign partner who will handle this investment for us in your country with integrity and honesty to a huge success in your country. Your able co-operation is needed to make this investment for we want your help to invest our share in your country into a very lucrative business venture which will generate substantial market in your country.  I am a widow and my husband was martyred for the cause of my country in the military coup of 1989. My husband was martyred because of my country's political crisis in my country then. During my husband's life in the military, he was among the top military commanders who surrendered to the new civilian government of General Sani Abacha, who is a sinner and a mass murderer.  During my husband's life in the military, he was among the top military commanders who surrendered to the new civilian government of General Abacha, who is a lump on mass murder, because he betrayed the country to the West African war.  Since the death of my husband, the United Kingdom has been through several military governments.  During my husband's life in the military, he deposited the sum of $15 Million (Fifteen million, fifteen hundred thousand United States dollars) with a security and finance company here in the UK, which he now intends to withdrawal from the country due to the political crisis in my country.  After the withdrawal has been approved by the local court, I will come over to meet with you to consider the withdrawal of the fund.  However, before this can be done, I need your help and co-operation so that the re-embursement of the fund will be made to you.  Therefore, if you are interested in this transaction, I propose that you, if you so desire, furnish me with your private telephone and fax number.  I will contact the security company and ask them to forward the fund to you.  I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive the fund as my foreign client and as a result of the withdrawal of the fund, you will also be entitled to receive the fund.  We can then share the money or have it re-calculated under a new name on the agreement of both of us after we have separated.  I have set out the entire withdrawal to you in my latest letter, so you should receive it without delay.  I need your direct and confidential telephone and fax number for easy reach. Please do not reply me at this email address, as I will explain in detail in my next mail.  Please reply to my private address below,,, for security reasons. Thank you and God bless, MRS CYNTHIA CAMARA

Dear friend, I got your contact from the Seva registry on line e.t.c. Na,res.t.cons, nd ig. ve, cntty.ai,the registrar of  consigment.e.v,e does not want to proceed any further with the case until there is a demand from the bank for the transfer of funds. The source of this demand is as follows: There is a deposit in a bank and out went a number of our good friends who were ex-military/political/ intelligence/ civil servants, including my good friend the former DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND CHIEF OF SOCIAL SERVICES, who was until recently, an Adjutant General of Nigeria before he was killed last year by the insurgents working with the Federal Government of Mr. Gen. Samba Abdul Kareem (R) after a pitched battle in which one of his personal aide was killed as well. The source of this deposit is as follows: On the 11th of April 2002, a Foreign Oil consultant and consultant/ contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million five hundred thousand Dollars) for our assistance in the purchase of crude oil and natural gas from different Governments and Offices. The time (Fixed) Deposit was originally coded as a Memorial and was intended for my uncle as a living, but unfortunately he died before the end of the year.The bank has since sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but have not heard from him. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward To lay claims for the fund as his heir. This leaves the bank as the only known address for the fund, and we have traced all our good friend's relatives living or dead and has discovered that none have been able to lay claims for the fund as the coming of age years for the FOBOLDING AGENTS does not count for anything. The situation is beyond desperate and we must act now or miss out the money. If you are interested, send to us an e-mail the text of the letter and your Telephone/Fax number for further discussions and discussion. Please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality.

I am the Director of Private Banking Services Group, a member of the Special Advisory Group on Private Banking Services of the World Bank.   I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On April 20, 1996, an American Mining Consultant/Contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Daniel Creel made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Daniel Creel died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Daniel Creel did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

From: Mr. Zuhair Idris
Title: CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Friend, My name is Mr Zuhair Idris,the son of late Engr.Zuhair Idris who was a private contractor to the former President of African Development Bank (ADB) travail Guinea. I am 59 years old, i am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. My late father was a prolific farmer and also a successful business man, until his death. He was killed by a group known as the "COUNTER-BREAKING ACTIN" on the orders of the former President of the former Republic of Seriouns Sierra-Leone Charles Taylor, who came to power during the peace pact agreement in Ivory- coast. During the peace agreement,my father was given the sum of US$8,000,000.00 (Eight million United States dollars). My father was also given the sum of US$2,000,000.00 (one hundred and fifty million two hundred and twenty million united state dollars) to help me to settle in the counries of Europe during my father's presidency. In view of this,when the peace deal was concluded between the two countries,a lot of our money was going to be donated to the (World) Red Cross and other relief organizations,which is helping those affected by natural disasters and other social       tragedies, as well as some good investments in industrial and commercial enterprises. During my father's presidency, I was also made a brigadier in the army,and during my father's time as a member of the parastatale (parliamentarian) in my country, I was given the responsibility of asking the army to declare any overseas account held by the former members of the junta that has not been declared declared and to put it into the government account, as the latter did declare the account to the contrary. It was decided to put the funds into the government account only after a lot of searching in vain for the account owner. More than a month ago,the funds came up in my father's account, but the account has never been linked back to him. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account owner is none other than late Engr.Zuhair Idris, a foreigner, who died in 1981. no other person knows about this account or any related one, and as such, the government is not aware of the account. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the fund can be released in your favor. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to help my self to secure the release of the fund as the beneficiary next of kin. Hence, I am writing to you with the help of my attorney, to seek your assistance in transferring the money to your account and claiming it on my behalf.  Because after all the work and study i have put in so that i can be considered as the next of kin, i have a good percentage of the fund, which i will give to you as my share, after the successful transfer of the fund to your account.  All you need do is to assure me that you will let me have the right to claim the fund in your country should you be able to assist me to invest it in a profitable business.  I wish to assure you that this business is risk free as i have put in a lot of time and effort in this business, and also, i hope you will consider my person and my interest before relying on me unconditionally.  I need your assistance because i have decided to part company with you, and so that we can invest this money in a lucrative business in your country, after i have successfully transferred the fund to your account.  If this proposal satisfies you, please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.  I will greatly appreciate if you reply via this email address as soon as you receive this request, as i will then provide you with more information and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Apart from this, i have decided to give you 20% of the total sum, 2% for your assistance and 3% for expenses, which may arise during the course of the transaction.  I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free because i have put in a good amount of time and effort in this business. Thanks and God bless,  Yours Sincerely,  Zuhair Idris.

 Attention/ Permit Me To Approach You From  a distance. Attention/ Permit Me, My name is Mrs. Gwendolyn Bevan, am a widow and a father of three children by John Bevan who worked with the present president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.D.C) John Ivanishi . When President Ivanishi came to power in my country the previous president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Mbundu Kabbah) had controlled the country during his rule .During my father's rule, my father was killed by a group known as "The Union of Soldiers  belonging to the ruling party of President Kabbah and his associates" with the help of an army general who was at the time supporting the president in his struggle for re-election. I lost my father. I had a son at the time, but he died when I was about six months pregnant with his first born. Before my husband's death on the 18th of May 2000, I discovered that my late husband deposited the sum of $25,000,000.00 (Twenty five Million United States dollars). into a high street bank here in Dakar Obre-Waite, Senegal. The money was lodged in a box as a family valuable belonging and for external use only. I have the receipt of the money Direct Order Book and it was delivered to me by the bank on my behalf. I am now contacting you because I have a urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6, 2003 my late husband deposited the sum of $25,000,000.00 (Twenty five Million united state dollars) in a bank here in Dakar Obre-Waite, Senegal. I immediately sent a routine notification to the address indicated and waited for the response. The next day, the bank called and informed me that my late husband was dead. I immediately notified the police and the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo colluding with one another and the bank director, this was because the president had given directive to the president that all financial institutions should put an end to the existence of the war crimes tribunals. I followed the instruction and gave the fund to the bank. Now I discovered that my late husband was not dead but had taken refuge in Senegal with the help of some diplomatic agents,he had deposited the money in a high street bank here in Dakar Obre-Waite and that the bank director, believing that the money was his personal property, had given the order to the bank directors to deliver the money to me.I immediately went to the high street and found my late husband's account books and the money was finally delivered to me. I immediately called the bank and discovered that my late husband was actually dead. He had indeed taken refuge in Senegal with the help of some diplomatic agents and the bank director. All I need from you is your absolute trust and honesty. I am waiting for your urgent reply. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Gwendolyn Bevan.

Title: URGENT BENEFICIARY OF SOCIAL WORK
 URGENT BENEFICIARY OF SOCIAL WORK Dear Sir/Madam, I am contacting you on a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude Will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry, foreign trade division. An account was open by a  foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. PROPOSITION; Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million five hundred thousand united state dollars (us$25,000,000.00) in a safe vault of a reputable bank here in Nigeria for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary or beneficiary's next of kin. Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year. It may interest you to know that all the contracts executed on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) during the civilian administration of the war in Nigeria have been transferred to the control of the Federal Government of Nigeria. N.P.C. have given express authorisation to the concerned ministries to transfer the funds to any foreign account they please, but so far the money has not been transferred. A few days ago a delegation from the Nigeria Civil Defence Force (NCFD) met with a representative of the bank in London and instructed them to provide the next-of-kin of the deceased, so that the funds would be released in your favour as the beneficiary or next of kin. The N.P.C. has also approved the transfer of the funds to the bank as the beneficiary or next of kin, though the agreement between the two bank to this effect is very important. The N.P.C. have also stipulated that the next of kin shall be a foreigner even if a Nigerian has provided an alibis number which is used in the establishment of alibis for the purpose of claim in the court of law. I have considered the matter and shall take the decision based on the agreement which you and the bank have reached. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the particulars of the transaction. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Yours Sincerely. Mr. Nelson Bidi .

Title: Assistance
 Assistance Dear Sir/Madam, I am a Barrister and the Personal Attorney to a deceased client who was an expatriate/intern at a leading bank in South Africa .The deceased had an account opened in the bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on the account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that the deceased had an account balance of $11,500,000.00 USD(Eleven million five hundred thousand dollars) in a leading bank in South Africa .The amount was deposited in a non-compliant account and the owner of the account, an Indian but not a resident i.e he had no possible way of coming to the United States. I have therefore contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by the deceased. The customer died as a result of a heart attack and all attempts by the medical people to trace his next of kin was fruitless. The patient had no next of kin and the bank cannot nominate any next of kin. As the Account Officer to late account holder I have the power to influence the release of the fund to any foreigner that comes up as next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account. If you agree to act as a foreign partner/beneficiary to this account then I want you to send me a letter of claim to enable me prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the fund. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for any local or international expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by me and my colleagues and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Title: INVESTMENT / TRANSFER OF THE 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS 
 INVESTMENT / TRANSFER OF THE 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS  Dear Friend, I am Mr.Rene Abala, deputy senior regional manager at Plc (South African Reserve Bank), a member of the executive committee set up by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you to assist me in a business transaction, of which I am going to relate you about in detail in a future business project. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, an American mining consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Justin Hanu made a (Fixed deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued at US$12,500,000.00 (12,500,000.00),in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Justin Hanu did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in our Bank. This sum of US$12,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by our bank management since no one has heard from the owner since 1997. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information. With the recent change of government in my country, I believe they will help to repatriate this fund to my country. I have the legal authority of my bank management to request that the fund be moved out of my country immediately, if they so desire, but I will advise them to contact me first thing next working day to enable us file a joint action for the transfer of the funds in their favour. I have proved to them that I can handle such amount in strict confidence and trust, if they so desire, but advise to avoid contacting me at all. All legal documents to back up my claim as the next of kin are still with me, I have Certified they are real and come from a reliable place, I have proved to them that the funds belongs to me. I have also given them all the documents to back up my claim as the next of kin. I have proved to them that the funds belongs to me as the only next of kin. I have also given them all the relevant documents to back up my claim as the next of kin. I have also given them the sum of US$12,500,000.00 to settle any discrepancy between the two of us. Please I want you to note that this transaction is hitch free and risk free, if you take care of it properly. I have employed some experienced Bankers in various countries to provide us with the facilities to move this fund out of West Africa immediately, provided you promise to assist me. If you are interested, contact me on my direct private fax number (+27- ) 33-509-0800 or send me email to indicate your interest. I will make every effort to get to the root of the problem, regardless of whether you contact me on direct or by indirect means. The problem now is that the South African Government is clamping down on all peaceful political opposition parties, and as a result my travel documents have been cancelled. I cannot go back up to SA, my life and investments are now in danger. If I do decide to leave for a while, I will need to look for a reliable and honest partner with whom to do the business, which will enable me to relocate my family and investment with my family's money. Please kindly reply to my private and confidential email, I will be very glad if you take this proposal very serious. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. I await your urgent reply. Yours faithfully, Mr.Rene Abala

But be sure it is a real deal and a legitimate business proposal, as we have discussed and agreed on many other terms before with the devil. God be with you. Please treat this matter with utmost sensitivity and  confidentiality, as the confidential correspondence of this nature requires. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. We have a cash fund of Twenty Million, five hundred thousand United States dollars, which we inherited from my late father the late President of Nigeria. My father is presently incarcerated in Nigeria for his part in the War in Africa. I have been in detention since I was arrested six years ago and I have no family that has ever come to visit me. My father was the one who introduced the concept of "(Cash) Control" which was introduced by the United Nation in its guidelines for financial control after the peaceful co-existence of majority of the members for more than ten years. My family was subjected to personal torture during my stay in detention and I have had enough of this suffering. I have managed to escape from detention and I have given birth to a healthy baby boy that will not need to visit this country at all. My family will be interested in investing in your country as soon as I heard from you, but I will advise you against any deal since I have stopped taking care of my children. I have given birth to a male child that is settling in well-to-do Nigeria. He is the only child of my late husband and the sole surviving heir to the Family Estate. I have already made arrangement with a diplomat to visit the European country of his choice, but on instructions from the diplomat, I have brought to your notice that my health has deteriorated so badly that I can not go out, and I now inform you that you should consider my family business before investing in your country. Your country is quite rich in minerals and natural resources, which is why I brought my son to your notice. Consequently, if you accept my proposal and your sincere interest, I will furnish you with the full detailed information, procedure, amount involve and mutually agree on your percentage interest or share holding for helping me to secure the release of the deposit and investing the money in your country under your proper management and care. I am serious and have looked after my family very well, I have a young son to take care of him. I want you to help me to secure the release of the deposit and the investment of the money in your country under your proper management and care. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please do not hesitate to call me on my phone for further directives. No record was found on my mobile phone/tablet.

 Business For Sale? Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Stella Freda from the auditorium of the Standard Bank of South Africa . I am married to Mr. Howard Freda, who worked with us for fifteen years before he died in the year 2002. Before his death, he made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,652,000.00 (Seventeen Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my Bank without my knowledge or consent. I wanted to give you a better offer, but I found out that the man who made the (Time) Departed From a past life as a missionary and he has since passed away (i believe he is now) but I have not heard from him since I have been on the run. After a month, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I tried sending again and finally I discovered that Mr. Howard Freda died from an automobile accident. On further inquiry, I discovered that he passed away without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he has no known or identifiable family relation in this country. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Howard Freda did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$12,652,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Upon  maturity in 1995, the deceased gave me the money to  deal with a foreign partner, who has since died but left an orphan status in my trust. I am presently dealing with that same  person, and we are able to get the whole sum settled in his account. However, my desire would be that you contact me on his behalf so that we can use the funds in  investment plans of mutual benefit. With my present position in the office, I can transfer this money to any person you name, or any company  you designate, as beneficiary and also contribute part of the Money to his worthy charity organizations. I hope to build a  special partnership with you that will not infringe the laws and ethics.  I shall give you 10% of the whole Money for your assistance, as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organization from your locality.  I hope to hear from you soon. Send also your private telephone and fax number to enable me contact you

Title: Urgent Message From diary
 Urgent Message From diary Dear Sir, I am Mr.Dean Barker the Auditor General of a reputable bank in Nigeria.I have an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Voelker a foreigner and a farmer, and his family are members of a cooperative real estate investment company. He has a numbered time (fixed) deposited for a particular investment in 1987 valued at $21.500,001 (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ). I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr. Voelker died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Voelker did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the banks files. This sum of $21.500,000.00 USD (Twenty One Million United States Dollars) was deposited in a vault in a bank in the United Kingdom, and declared in my name. I am contacting you in token of our mutual business interest to do business together and also to benefit our respective families.  I am contacting you because this money belongs to me and my family, and I alone have the means to claim the money. I want to do this because I am the only remaining relative of the deceased that has made suit, through a court order, to have the money declared "current" without ever presenting any next of kin or relation.  I will be twenty five years old when I receive this money and I want to establish a relationship with you and take care of my family honestly and properly. I will give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, as you will also help me to invest the rest of the money in a lucrative business. If you are interested, send me an email immediately with your full Name and address so that we can discuss the modalities of doing business together. I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you to make your case. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Detailed information regarding the transaction will be sent to you as soon as you indicate your interest in working with me. I await for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, MR.DANIEL  WILLIAMS

I am, geologist Dr. Paul Heneghan, of the National Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NNRPA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers, working for UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA (U.B.A) died on site accidently with his family while harvesting coal at KUMU,A CHINESE WORKING RESIDENTIAL INSTITUTE AND TRUST AFFAIR IN NICHE, AFRICA.  Since we found his body, we have been expecting his next of kin to come to our bank and claim his money because we never knew he was going to leave.  But all the efforts of the bank so far to contact any of the relatives has backfired and now we know that Mr. Travis Myers did not leave any family or relations. His business card was never found, and his burial certificate was never processed.  All efforts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  We know that the bank will not believe us if we tell them so.  Consequently, we would want you to present your right hand to receive the part of the money in cash as Mr. Travis Myers' next of kin or beneficiary. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your complete names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the next of kin.  The money will be moved through a diplomatic means to a security company for safe keeping and for the establishment of a beneficiary's account in your name. The money will be paid into your account by the security company for safe keeping and subsequent investment purposes in your country. The amount involved is (USD$10.000,000.00)Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United states Dollars)and will be shared as follows: 1. 20% of the total amount will be for you as the next of kin 2. 80% of the total amount will be for us. All I require is your honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be the one where you stand on the other side of history. Please get in touch with me on my private email address for more information and dealing with the banker.  Best Regards,   MR.P. KABILA

Title: Urgent Proposal
  URGENT                                URGENT   Dear Friend, I am a Barrister specialising in contracts and the legal adviser to the parastatals concerned. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of Works and Housing Ministry in favour of a consortium of several bidders to the tune of US$18,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). The original value of these contracts were carefully worked out and approved by the Works and Housing Ministry in favour of the consortium of Multinationals due to the importance of the task at hand. The contracts were: (1)Buildings Quarters Compartment (W&Q) of the Federal Works Bureau (F.W.B). (2)Operate and maintain Aerodrome aerodrome(A.E.O) seat for aircraft (three- and four-and-half seat) and between 2003 and 2007 a new aerodrome Aerodrome Aerodrome in Abuja (Akwa Ibom) was fully operational and registered with the Ministry of Works and Housing as one of the three main aerodromes to serve the major aerodromes in the country. (3)Operate Area Compartment (O.A.C.) of the Works and Housing Bureau in Abuja. The original value of these contracts was carefully worked out and in fact awarded to a consortium of three bidders,but in the scrutiny of the books that were carefully worked out by the consortium before the bids were actually lodged, we discovered that the actual values of the three bidders were in excess of the amount actually agreed upon in the books. This by itself is not a cause for alarm, but we believe that the present Government is about to order the money withdrawn because the contracts have been successfully executed. This is because the Consortium of Multinationals that actually executed the contracts have been paid their full amount,as per the terms of the contracts, while the Government has lodged its next instalment in the escrow accounts of the consortium. By virtue of our position as civil servants and members of the panel set up by the Government to supervise the Projects,we have the power to influence the direction of the funds so that the funds will not be diverted to the unfair advantage of some foreign partner.   I have the authority of my board Chairman (Mr.T. Wady), who is a CIVIL SERVANT, to demand that the funds be released from the contract account immediately so that the funds can be used in the properf of my country. This is because we have been overtaken in line with the instructions of the panel to the tune of US$18,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  We have successfully secured the release of the funds from the Central Bank of my country, pending my personal travel to your country to engage in business transactions.  I have agreed to take you as my foreign partner so that you can use the fund in a lucrative business venture in your country, during my visit to you in July 2008, to further my studies.  Please note that the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, I would want you to make arrangements carefully to make sure we can share the funds in a profitable business venture in your country, within 10 banking days.   If you are interested, contact me on my confidential fax number +27-374-0114 or mail to the above address, immediately you acknowledge receipt of this mail.  I shall be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you so desire, but do urge you to give the matter your immediate attention it deserves. Thank you and God bless. Yours sincerely, Barrister Boyd T Wady

Title: Business Transaction.
 Business Transaction. Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Dr. Sanjay K.Mande, director of Bills and Exchange at Kenya Commercial Bank (KCBC).This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy, Mr.kassim Hassan made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, (being 28.6 months) valued at US$21,500,000.00 USD (Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.kassim Hassan died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.kassim Hassan did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 21,500,000.00 USD deposited in my Bank without any prior knowledge of its right to be there as a Next of Kin or beneficiary. The said money is in US dollars and is available for my bank to claim or invest in any country around the world.

Title: Reply
 Reply Dear Friend, Compliments of the season. This is a proposal in confidence. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. Ateeq Rahman KHAN (a.k.a John Kenneth B)| made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. Ateeq Rahman died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that he died without making a WILL (Statement of Will) and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ateeq Rahman died without providing any next of kin or relations in ALL his years of service with the SAUDI ARABIA CHEMICAL SERVICE. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Iraqi law, if by the end of this year an Iraqi is accused of having had a hand in the death of a Foreign Contractor, the Iraqi Government will release the funds to the Iraqi's account. If the accused is found not guilty, the fund will be transferred into the government's account. If this proposal satisfies you. please do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. I await your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, MR. ATEQ RAHMAN KHAN

Title: URGENT
 URGENT REV JABI RUBRÉ Greeting from distant and just beyond Derithi, in the Arc de Triomphe, in South Africa. My name is Rev.Jabbu Mboli, is the chairman of Contract Award and review Committee set up by the Federal Government of Tanzania in good time to supervise the work of foreign Contract Review Verification Committees (CRTC) in order to procure goods and services from abroad. I got your contact through the South Africa trade and industry, and from my own personal research, I discovered that you might be interested in his company. The firm is a foriegn service, procurement company based in Europe that operates and manages contracts in the fields of construction, civil administration, military equipment, pharmaceuticals, natural resources, Fluorite, Nuclear Reactor, Computer and communication equipment. The firm was also managed by an African President who is a loyal  supporter of the African Union (AU), formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU). I was very much looking forward to serving you, since you are a potential business man. However, as it turned out, we are not supposed to be in contact because of our positions. The President of the Society had to make a stop in Ghana to meet with some Egyptian Coptic Christians, who are victims of famine and plague, and also to lay hands on some properties. So, we decided to divert the funds for the exploration of the earth and resources for the future into a foreign account. This was to meet our personal and Company's needs but also to invest the money in a lucrative business in your country. We want to invest the money in your country under your supervision, as you will also be helping me to claim the properties when finally transferred to your custody. Please feel obliged to respond to this mail if you are interested in my proposed business investment in your country. I will be very glad if you take this proposal very serious. I hope that we can have a very fruitful business relationship. Accordingly, I will want you to assist me to invest my share in your country, so that you too can have a profitable investment in your country. After all,we have agreed that 40% of the total fund will be for you as our foreign partner, while 80% will be for me. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do feel that you are in a position to help me,please do not hesitate to contact me immediately by return mail:  jabbuc@zwallet.com also, you can forward to me your request for assistance to enable us conclude the investment in your country under legitimate arrangement. I will be very glad if you do, and I hope to God that you treat this matter seriously. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I await your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Rev.Jabbu Mboli

Title: ASSIST US
 ASSIST US Dear Friend, Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is required in order for this transaction to be successful.  I am in need of your assistance.  My name is Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, the Auditor General of a reputable bank in Nigeria.  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1996, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Ministry of Petroleum, Mr. Kenneth Williams made a (Fixed deposit valued at S$18,000,000.00) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Federal Ministry of Petroleum, that Mr. Kenneth Williams died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Kenneth Williams did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$18,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five), the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank.  I am writing you because I as a public servant, I cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.  I am writing you because I want you to help me present the funds to the Financial institution and also lodge it in your country for investment purposes.  I have all necessary documents that will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.  All I need is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. You should provide me with your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the funds. I have agreed to give you 20% of the total money for your assistance, 2.5% for expenses incurred during the course of this deal and the remaining 75% for me and my family.  On final conclusion of this business, I wish to advise you to come over to my country to open a non-resident account in your name and to facilitate other Bank account opening in your country with your Bank.  I will take you into confidence because my life and future depend on this fund.  I am waiting for your urgent reply so that I will give you more details. if you are interested, please reply me. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Contact:  mohamed_zahir01@yahoo.com

I have been par wasn  of a foreigner by name for about a year and a half now, and I  need your help to invest my inheritance in your country or anywhere  in your  far-flung region for the promised reward. I am in need of your assistance because my foreign  patron who maintains a Consulate/Departmental Account in  your country has directed me to locate a reliable foreign partner who  will provide an account where the fund will be  claimed, invested and paid into since the wealth is not controllable in  your country. The owner of the account is a foreigner, and the  beneficiary a living foreign c o mmer who will be making arrangement for the  next of kin to come and claim his/herfunds in 8 (eight) working days.All  my banker and some of my government officials are  in favour of the claim and have agreed to offer you 45% of the  total money for your assistance, 10% will be  set aside  for expenses incurred during the transaction and the  remaining 65% will be for my family investment in your country as  envisaged by your bank. In fact, I have  already made arrangement for the investment of  my own share in your country as compared to where you propose  me to start and oversea by providing a safe harbour and  investment opportunity in your country for future investment. In view of this,the  proposal of this transaction has been made with absolute confidence.  I accept your challenge to invest this money in your country or any region in  any part of the world on your own share as your country's  sole real beneficiary and share as soon as you apply for it in your banking  system.  I want to invest in a stable economy, politically stable countries with  stable governments and politics, militaries and civilians.  In your country, this requires a stable political class and the general  support of the people as you will introduce a rule of law in the  country and the people will support you 100% in your investment.  Even though you will have to offer some percentage of your earnings to  fund my participation in the business, it is risk-free in the  sense that I have taken the liberty of consulting my conscience and  I hope you will grant me the opportunity to present my case to you and  help me.  Please await your urgent response.  Best Regards,  MR.SUSAN MORGAN

Title: CONTRACT REALLOCATION AND PAYMENT
 CONTRACT REALLOCATION AND PAYMENT ATTN  : I am writing in respect of a business transaction contemplated by  you. Upon my request, you may be forgiven for beleiving that this is one of the most confidential  transactions you will ever broach with me.  I am Mr. T. Jackson, the former Managing Director of Europe West (now British Petroleum) Middle East and /West Africa Business office of the Nigerian National Petroleum (NNP) here in England. On the 21st of August 1999, my colleague and I were involved in a fatal car accident with other government officials,  on our way to the office.  During the course of the hunt for my colleague, we discovered that my colleague had died from the injuries sustained in the fatal accident. I immediately and without delay made  arrangements to have the fund retrieved from my private vault here in Nigeria.  The manual filing for the manual retrieval of the fund (U.S. $21,500,000.00 USD) according to the code of conduct office in the  Nigerian National Petroleum is all that is required for a successful and final  transaction. N.N.P.A. has given directed all Banks to make available to the fund the sum of Twenty-one million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$21,500,000.00) deposited by my colleague in a  Bank in England, as Next of Kin.  The money was meant for purchase orders for our two aircraft,  which were delivered to us from the British Government.  The contract was awarded to a consortium of foreign firms,  British Petroleum, Williams, Gray &amp; Russell and Red Apron Bureau.  The contract was for the supply of natural gas to the Nigerian National  Petroleum, and the total amount so delivered was US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars).  Because of the way the election was being organised, the contracts were awarded  unalloyed  to the consortium of foreign firms.  This means that the contract has been awarded to the UK firm for the supply of natural gas to the  consortium.  This is the basic structure of our contracts business here in Nigeria.  We have all the necessary legal documents that can back up any claim we may make in  this business.  All we need is an honest and trustworthy person that we can trust to help us to transfer this fund to any  foreign account that we devise.  For your assistance, we have offered you 35% of the total sum for your  assistance, 60% will be for me while the  remaining  5% will be for all expenses.  All you have to do to make this transaction effective  is to provide us with your company's name or any other name as long as you  will be able to receive the funds, then we will take our share .  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my  private email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  information and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Title: YOUR ATTENTION/COURAGE 
 YOUR ATTENTION/COURAGE                                     URGENT BUSINESS / INVESTMENT PROJECT / INVESTMENT CONSORTIUM  Dear Friend, I am MR. IBRAHIM BAAJI, the former President of Liberia, who was assassinated on the 29th of April 1998 by his political rival Dr. Raza Ndeoka. Before my father's death, he had taken me to Uganda to register and make application for the transfer of my People's money to the (Federal  Republic of Abidjan, (FRANCE).   However, after I registered and made application, he suddenly turned and killed me in cold blood in my hotel room.   Before my father's death, he told me that he made a purchase in Uganda and that he would like me to collect it on his behalf and dispatch it to him, but that I should stop because of the situation in our country now.   He also told me that my late father was a generous man, he had taken me to his country to look for a trust worthy business partner, and after a fruitless search, we have found your company. Please do give us your word and response to our proposal in our private email.   On the 21st of September 1999, my uncle, my father's associate, and his wife were involved in a car accident along Kano  State Highway.   Before my father's death, he told me that he made a safe withdrawal of MY (20 MILLION DOLLARS) into a foreign account, and that he would like me to help him collect the consignment on his behalf, but that I should stop because of the situation in my Country now.   I immediately collected the consignment and sent it to him, but to no avail. I immediately visited the Secret Vault in the Country and made inquiries there about the consignment, but as this is a 1,000,000.00 (NINTEEN THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). I have contacted you to assist in  repatriating the money which I have left in the Country. As a public servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to own or operate foreign account.   I therefore made further inquiry to your company's internal computer system and found that the funds was deposited there, and as a private contractor with no known or identifiable family member, I am also a security risk. Therefore, I seek your assistance in the following: 1)I will like you to provide a safe account into which the money can be transferred since I am also a voter. 2)You can come down to your country to open a non-resident account in your name which you can either provide me with or you can provide any account you have in your name which I will use to transfer the funds to you. 3)After we have merged these three requirements, we will be able to conclude the transfer in about 10 banking days. If you are interested, send the above information as soon as you received this mail to enable us start the process immediately. I await for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, MR. IBRAHIM BAAJI

Title: BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
 BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT Good day,  This request may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have never seen before.but i believe it is one day that you get to know somebody either in a theoretical or physical relationship. My name is Charles Darwin, an attorney at law and member of the board of the contract award and review committee of the World Trade Organization (W.T.O.). My committee is composed of representatives from a number of Contract Award Monitoring Countries (C.A.M.C.) and several Organization that are members of the World Trade Organization (W.O.A.). We are also represented on behalf of a Foreign Contractor by the law firm of the same name. We have in our custody the sum of Fifty Million United States dollars (US$50,000,000.00) which was the subject of a contract awarded and executed for delivery in 2002 and 2003. We are members of the Contract Award Monitoring Committee set up by the WTO agreement in 2001 and 2003 to monitor all contracts in force immediately to avoid this money from becoming uncollectable. This contract was with intention of being completed in the first half of 2004 when the money became unserviceable because of the non-availability of a competent foreign partner. The Contract was awarded and executed under a Different Contractor Award and exactly as the contract was supposed to be executed, the contract was awarded and executed in a strange manner, with the intention of over invoicing the contract, the contract was awarded and executed to the detriment of the foreign partner and the fund (US$50,000,000.00) which is in possibility of diversion into the control of a foreign government if not managed correctly. In the course of running the audit on the funds, we discovered that some months ago an account was opened in one of these accounts, without any beneficiary specified or indicated and the account was assigned to another member of the committee, who has since been charged with breach of the law by the Compte, for his role in the alleged over invoiced contract. This Transaction is subject to approval from my office and I want you to act as the beneficiary of the account in two ways: 1. If you agree to assist, you can contact me by email on the above telephone number or by fax on the above fax number. 2. If you are not interested, you can contact me through my above email address. Both these ways will involve you making arrangement with us and I want to end this quickly so you can focus on other business in your country. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, tender your urgent response through our email address at: <at>abcnews.com>  I await to hear from you soonest. Yours Sincerely, Charles Darwin

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIM) in favour of a U.A.E based company in favour of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIM).The original value of the total contracts were successfully executed when the companies returned positive balance of money in our bank.However, the consortium that executed the contracts in favour of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy returned negative balances to the bank, and we are presently waiting for the funds to be paid into our accounts pending our own claim, claim approved in your country or by you when you certify the funds in your account to B.A.M.P.(British Antarctic Survey) under your control before we can transfer the money out.     As a result of the current situation in the country as a whole and Government pressure on my country to settle or accept some other country's money ,I in collaboration with two other top officials of the bank have proposed to  operate an "unsolicited" account in our bank here to receive the funds on our behalf without delay and also to allow us to share the money in the balance of 80% for us and 20% for you, while 10% should be used to defray any incidental charges and all is paid in our favour. It has been agreed that 20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account, while the remaining 80% will be for us. This transaction is 100% risk free with your help and assistance. Your unsolicited account has no risk attached , so feel free to give us your positive or negative opinion as you wish to be included in the above detailed information. If you are interested I will require your banking information as mentioned below. My office is presently in, and will issue a letter of authorization to the account owner in your favour to enable us transfer the money to your account in your country without delay and also to enable us share the money in the balance of 80% with you.I have all necessary legal documents for the transfer of the funds in your favour. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Title: VERY URGENT
 VERY URGENT Dear Sir, My name is tejano fuzane, the only surviving son of late former minister tejano fuzane . I got your contact through the South Africa trade and industry, and after going through your profile, I was quite confident in your reliability and capability to the support of my family. My late father was a minister in the government of the Federal Government of my country in the land war that broke out in the land dispute. During the land war, my father was killed in action by Government troops. Before my father fell, he had taken power to the point where we have no other option than to leave the country immediately because of the situation we are in now. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers, and we are being harassed by the South African Trade Monitors' Association (S.A.T.A.) and other Unions to a country of our choice due to the situation here. We are politically asylum seekers because we are now refugees from the land war. We want to invest our money and live our life the way he instructed but there are certain measures we need to take in order to make sure our investment is successful and avoid the need for a reunion tax when the funds is finally come back to South Africa. I want to assure you that your assistance is highly solicited and needed. I will be very grateful if you accept to assist us. Our father was a prosperous business man who lived an easy life. I have the documentations of all the transactions that are going on with my father before he met his untimely death on air crash. I also have all the correspondence with the security Company where he lodged the deposit for the deposit of the money in my name as the beneficiary next of kin. I will gladly make known to you the procedures I am going to follow to ensure the funds will be successfully transferred to your country. I am serious and I stress this strongly because I don't want to miss out on the deal because of my position now. If you are interested, send me an e-mail immediately. I want to inform you of the next step to pursue as soon as possible. Please treat this matter with absolute secrecy and confidentiality. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your urgent response. Please reply by sending to my private address as tejano_fwuzane@indiatimes.com Yours faithfully, tejano  fuzane.

During my husband's life service time he was among the few military members who  retired early due to illness and also on the advice of our doctor before he died .

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE  RESPONSE  PLS
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  RESPONSE  PLS Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Billada, an Assistant State Auditor of a  Bank in Zimbabwe. I need your assistance in the following transaction.    I discovered a dormant account in a private banking division of Zimbabwe Bank.   The owner of the account is Mr. Anderson abacha (One Hundred and Twenty-nine years old) who was a  farmer and business man before he was  murdered in cold blood by his business associate for his alleged support and sympathy for  the rebels in Zimbabwe war. Upon further investigation, I found out that Mr. Anderson abacha  did not actually live in Zimbabwe but had an account in a finance firm in Cotonou Benin Republic  of the Republic of Benin, belonging to one of our foreign customers who died with his family  in the September 11th plane crash. The fund in question is US$8Million (Eight Million United States Dollars), which  was claimed by the foreign account holder as his heir or next of kin.    The law here stipulates that at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Zimbabwe Bank.    Based on the law and order situation in Zimbabwe, I would expect that this money would be  repatriated through the diplomatic means, to be used for the development of our  economy and our military might, thus enabling us to modernize our armed forces.    However, because of the current situation in Zimbabwe, the government and the  ruling party supporters have instigated a mass killing campaign in which  supporters of Mr. Anderson abacha have been killed in cold blood by the government supporters.    I have been given the responsibility of seeking the next of kin of the deceased.    I have been given the option of paying for the right of inheritance to the  deceased or any other person that has been nominated by me, as long as you agree to assist me  in investing the funds in your country or any other country outside Africa,   under your control and care. I have the option to go into partnership or  any other investment with you in your country or any other country within 20 (percent) of the total fund.   If I decide to invest the funds in your country, you will be required to assist me to invest my share in  your country or any other country outside Africa.  I have all the necessary legal documents for the investment and I am assuring you that the funds will be successfully moved  into your country or any other country where you will manage it for investment purposes.   If you are interested, send me a mail on the above fax number or contact me on my telephone for more information.  Best Regards,   Barrister.

After some negotiation,The contract was awarded to a consortium of foreign firms that included my own firm.The original contractors have since been paid, but the original contractors have refused to provide the account owner or beneficiary for the account to be closed due to the amount involved.  I have therefore contacted you to assist my family and myself by providing the account holder or beneficiary for the account to be used in conjunction with the deceased account.  I have also agreed to give you 20% of the total sum as compensation for your anticipated assistance, and 2% as miscellaneous expenses and cost, while 5% would be for expenses and taxation.

I was a merchant here in my country and also a Resident in Senegal for a considerable part of my working life. My thoughts is with my late Master, my government is collapsing around me, my home country is in danger and the United Nation is warning us of a possible humanitarian crisis. My Master is among the few remaining outstanding Macrobius cashier and he left a large amount of money before his time. I am contacting you based on trust. You are the only person I have met in my life thus far, before I became aware of the truth that I am about to reveal to you. You were the first and only person I have met in my life other than my Master, after my Master's death I have known him for quite a number of years and after my Master's death, I became acquainted with all his property,deposited it in the name of my deceased Master which I now intend to use for investment purposes, although I have not seen him for some years. Upon instruction from my late Master, I deposited the money which he left for me in a security and finance company here in country. I deposited the money in a box labeled "Personal effects" which was opened by my late Master. I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise as this is not the first time it has come to you.Nevertheless forgive me for the shock this proposal has caused you.I got your contact in my search on the Internet for a potential business partner.  I am from United States and my late Master was a businessman and a philanthropist before his death. My reason for contacting you is that I found your country and my Master's country to be very similar politically, socially and economically. However the main difference between us is our religion which my late Master had in common with his followers;we were both born again, both alive and well, and both now living in a democracy.We met on a business deal and since our hearts were set on different things,I decided to give this mutual friend of mine the sum of $8.000,000.00 (Eight million United States dollars) which my late Master had deposited for me in a security and finance company here in my country. I want you to assist me to invest this money for me and your country in a good business which will yield large income in the future.  Please,consider this proposal seriously.If you are interested, I will furnish you with the full detailed information, procedure, amount involve and mutually agree on your percentage interest or share holding for helping me to invest this money in your country and also contributing to the family home. I will also advise you on appropriate amount to contribute towards the family home. I hope to conclude this business within ten official working days.   Thank you and God bless.  Yours Sincerely, James From, James.James the only surviving Dajoun, Senegal.

Title: Business For Concerns of 
 Business For Concerns of  Dear Sir/Madam, I am Donald Pugono, a financial consultant based in East Africa. I have a client who wishes to invest in the United States. His name is Mr. Len Lubbock, an oil merchant/contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria who was indicted in 1994 for his part in the sale of crude oil in the United States during the Gulf War. On January 27, 1994, the Federal Government of Nigeria made an Order of Mandamus (OM) in my favour to Saudi Arabia to pay a particular account opened in the name of Mr. Len Lubbock but the account was never operated and the amount in question has never been paid into our bank. According to the F.N.I.A, the Federal Government of Nigeria can only approve a claim to a foreign account if the account has never been used nor operated before. In the opinion of the F.N.I.A.M., the charges and counter-charges against Mr. Len Lubbock were politically motivated and had the effect of discriminating between the accounts, hence the need to have a high profile. The original contract was supposed to be awarded to a consortium of foreign firms, but was scrapped because the Japanese Government refused to acknowledge the award. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a consortium of foreign firms, but was abandoned because of the political situation in Nigeria at that time. The contract was finally awarded to a consortium of foreign firms, which include two American and two British firm, which include a Contractor with Nigerian Company here in the UK. The contract was originally supposed to be awarded to a firm of our choosing, but was changed to a sole-source firm due to our proximity in location and preference in the relevant fields of Contracting. The original scope and nature of this contract was supressed by the present civilian Government. The contract was intended for the purchase of new factories and services for the Federal Government of Nigeria. Contractors are being denied their freedom to do their own thing and the process to get them out of Nigeria is extremely strict. It is because of the perceived possibility of not getting paid that the Chinese firm, in collaboration with me and my partner have approached you to provide a safe account where the cash will be moved out of my country into the safe custody of my company here in the UK. We have all the necessary legal documents that can back up any claim we may make, all we need is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I have already made arrangement in principle with a reputable and honest business partner in the UK to have the funds moved out of Nigeria through his Portcullis hotel room, but that arrangement has been and is still being monitored closely by the Portcullis Hotel staff and security and I have also informed them of the developments in the deal here. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1. Full Name 2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number 3. Your Contact Address. I await your urgent response. Thanks and Remain Blessed, Donald pugono

Title: Urgent SIR,
 Urgent SIR, From, Nenita.  Attn,     I am writing to you in an  urgent and very confidential business transaction. I believe that you will be in a position to help me   and my family in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven million,  seven hundred thousand United States dollars ($27.7 000.00) into a safe foreign account. The source of this fund is as follows: During my last month in Kenyan prisons, I discovered that I  was the only one being kept in solitary confinement. I have been in this situation for some time now and I know that whatever I do/say will not help the matter. I have been in there for over 2 years and I am still in jail. I have violated the peace and tension and tension of my prison cell by confiding in someone that I trust.   I have been in there for over two years because I have been a paranoiac. The condition in the jail is not good for me. The owner of the foreign account, his name is Mr. Charles Barry and he  is a banker with a security and finance company in the United States. He and his employees are  citizens of United State.   On the 23rd of April 1998, my mother died in a car accident on our collective  way to Florida.   Prior to her death, I had made several enquiries to the security company to locate any of my late  parents relatives but these have also proved fruitless. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to search for a person from my own  ethnic background which is a trait of mine, my mother is from my mother's country, Nigeria and she is  from Nigeria.   When I was in the hospital, I found out that my mother died from the accident and one of my father's relatives was among the thousands of people people that died in the accident.   I therefore made further enquiries to the security company about my late mother and also discovered that she died without making a Will.   I therefore made further enquiries to the security company and also discovered that my late mother did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.   This sum of US$27.7 000.00 has been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my late mother in the bank without any claim of ownership.   According to Ghana law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my family will be interested in investing this fund in Ghana, the country has good infrastructure and business climate, with a stable economy and an educated workforce.   We have decided to position ourselves as the next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds.   We want to invest the funds in a profitable venture in your country under your supervision.   Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1, Your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. 2, Your private and confidential telephone and fax number for easy communication and you can also contact me on my alternative email address, for better communication. 3, Your personal biographical information, where you will like the fund to be lodged and other information's that will help me to prepare the necessary documents and affidavit which will put you in place as the next of kin. 4, Your personal and confidential telephone and fax number for easier communication and you can also contact me on my alternative email address, for better communication. I await to hearing from you soonest.

Title: Urgent  Proposal
 Urgent  Proposal Dear Sir, I am Mr. Saeed Al-Hashemi, a merchant in Dubai -U. A. E. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On May 20, 1999, an American Mining Consultant/Contractor with the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Dunn made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Dunn died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Dunn did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$11,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Ethical Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Saudi Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately you telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and I will arrange all the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may Allah bless you.

URGENT BUSINESS MATTER:   ATTN:,  I am writing you based on the recommendation of my personal assistant who is a consultant of the above mentioned company. I am writing you based on the advice I received from my late colleague who died recently. Before my late colleague died, he was able to transfer out of the Bank of Africa (Banque BP)here in South Africa. He made use of the power of supervision to friendly transfer of the sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S.Dollars). This power was exercised by the late Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA) here, during the tenure of our former Chairman, who was also on the board of Directors of the above named bank.  That is to say, the former Chairman had the power to transfer out any amount of money he wished from the Bank here without any due process and without any legal justification.  This power was also granted to me as an "Overseas Working Trustee" of the new Board of Directors.  Though I have not worked for the bank for the past seven years, I am still a fully functional member of the old Board of Directors.

Title: I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISATION
 I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE. I am a widow from Sierra-Leone with a previous address given to the International Payments Centre by my Bank. When  my husband was a trader with (U.N.)C.AF.B.I. one of the war    committe disbs in Sierra-Leone but we were soon after effected from the war. My only son had gone to war with the rebels and during my husband's time as \ The white flag was flown at the back of the bank where we were located. After the death of my husband, I decided to transfer the sum of US$5,000,000.00 (Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars) into a safe foreign account specially established for that purpose. The money was a residue of our former employer, (U.N.A.C.AF.B.I) and my late husband's proceeds. Naturally, this made me and my only son to flee from Sierra-Leone to Ghana where we are currently seeking asylum. We now have safe haven in  (U.N.A.C.AF) and the amount is disbursed as a trust fund for orphans and widows. As a widow, I am now facing the dilemma of where to  dispose these funds. I cannot invest this fund in Ghana, as it is a war zone. My son told me that if I did not leave the country immediately, by the end of the week, we will all be dead. I could not understand why my son would die for something I did not approve of. The more I thought about it, the more determined I am to leave the country and  move to (Europe or America). Please kindly help me to think of a good investment in your country and also to suggest other good investment opportunities. For your assistance, I am ready to offer you 20% of the total funds, which are US$ 5,000,000.00 (Fifteen million united state dollars). I will arrange to have the money moved out of the country you propose and also assist you in any investments that you will advise us. The regulations of the bank prohibit us from talking with each other, therefore I need your assistance to allow us begin immediately. Please, feel able to also reply via my other means of communication, for security reasons. Please do not reply to this message if you are not interested, as I will want you to reply back to me with your full name and address so that we can commence the business relationship. I will make sure we are on the same page when I hear from you. I will also let you know where the money will be kept until we are sure of our safety. I will come over to your country when we are sure of our safety. I will visit your country soon so that you can collect the money and help us invest it. Please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. I will not let you know anything regarding the transaction until I hear from you. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between my son and you. Yours faithfully, MRS AISHA MOHAMMED.

  Urgent Assist. Dear Friend, My name is Daniel Wilson; Iam the son of late former Director of South African Minerals, and the leader of Loyal Association of South African Minerals (LAM). I got your contact in my search for a business partner abroad based on information from my late father who died in the process of my business transaction with him. Before his death, my father had deposited with a safe box company a total sum of $7,000,000.00 US (Seven million, five hundred thousand united state dollars) into a private account here in South Africa. The safety of the consignment was ensured by the staff of the private security firm as we were about to travel out to South Africa for investment.But due to the sudden death of my father, I and my brother were forced to leave the country before our family were able to collect the money. I have just contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my father before we have to share it with other family. He had foresees of extended life expectancy so he deposited the money with the private security company as a family treasure. I and my brother were going to leave the country when my father was killed in cold blood by the enemies during the war in my country.I have decided to contact you because of the need to involve a reputable and trusted foreign partner abroad. We can conclude the transfer in a matter of two days if you are to assist us. But I will advise you on how we want the money to be shared later depending on your urgent response to my letter. Keep in mind that at the core of this business is trust. Please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. I await your urgent reply. Yours faithfully Daniel Wilson.

 PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ATTN;Concerned Beloved , This email may come to you as a surprise, but sincerely you should listen to my offers of assistance to you.I know you will find it hard to believe but trust God and listen to my sincere pleas to you from my heart. I am a Sinopath who has lived a life of a worthy Christian. My wife and I were married for eleven years without a child. During these years we both suffered from somewhat annoying ulcer pains in our stomachs. During this time my health was failing so badly that we could not have a child. After the death of my husband, I inherited some money which my late husband deposited with a Security Company in Thailand for safe keeping. The doctor told me that I should not breed and also advised me to close all my accounts with the bank for good. After this I feel quite certain that my health will not be of any more use to me. So I decided to contact you earnestly requesting your help in replying to my letter.  My name is Mrs.M.Norman, I was married to my late husband for eleven years without a child.  During these eleven years I had three sons and two daughters. At the age of 22 years, my health finally gave way and I died from ulceration of the esophagus on January 6, 2002. My doctor told me that I should not breed anymore, I am 64 years old now, so I decided to look for a donor who will stand as my late husband's next of kin so that my two sons will inherit the money. To this end, I am seeking for a foreign partner to assist me in investing this money in a profitable business.  For your assistance,I am prepared to give you 20% of the total money while 2% will be set aside to assist me in paying for the medical treatment and raising my two sons.  And the rest will be for me for my family investment. I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make against the Security Company. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my secured and confidential fax number (+234)01723800 or private E-mail address for further detailed instructions.  I will greatly appreciate your co-operation, reply to my private email:  mrnelsonbongo@netscape.net  awaiting your urgent response ASAP. Regards,  Mrs. Nelson Bongo.

The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of $26,800,000.00 (Twenty-six million united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed the contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. I am aware of the inherent dangers inherent in this transaction, hence I seek your assistance in transferring this money out of Nigeria for investment purposes than leaving the fund here and to a suitable investment overseas. This transaction is risk free, the source of the funds is safe provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality, and good faith.

 URGENT ASSISTANCE  Dear Sir, I know you will be surprise to receive this message coming from us, more so when it came from an anonymous and good relation. I got your contact in the course of my private search and in yore too,but I never expected to get the confidence of someone on so many other hand. I am Mrs mercedes merino the wife of senior military man who for ten years ruled the Philippines before he died in the line of duty. Before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged a deposit of $30,000,000.00 USD in a security and finance company in my name as the next of kin and beneficiary. He did not tell me the nature of the deposit or the next of kin as the beneficiary. The content was not made aware until he died as some documents covering the deposit was left behind. The contents of the safe Box were: (1) $30,000,000.00 USD(Money in a box). (2) A certificate of deposit (3) A statement of claim. These are the required information to be provided to the security company for payment. The money is then moved out of the Philippines to my homeland for safe keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Islamic law, at the expiration of five (5) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the box. Therefore, my proposal to you is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased as I haved expect to receive the box from the security company but got the information that the box was never in existence in the first place because my foreign friendly partner did not understand the contents. I am willing to place you in a position to instruct the security company to release the box to you as the next of kin as I have shown you the correct address where the box is kept and also show you the security company's charge document covering this payment. I am giving you the offers as mentioned with every confidence on your acceptance to assist me and my family to transfer this fund to your country with your help and assistance. At the moment, the offers is not good enough for me as I need closer relations in your country before I will consider anything. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my confidential fax and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details that will help you understand this transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction could be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Title: Urgent  Response
 Urgent  Response ATTN,, I will like to apply through this medium for your co-operation and help in the execution of  my  investment intention in your country. I am Mrs. mariam abacha, the wife of the late president of Nigeria, the Democrat of the Former Zaire Republic of Sierra Leone, who was assassinated by a group known as the 'Liberation Tigers' during the war in Sierra-Leone. I inherited a total sum of 25 million five hundred thousand United States of America dollars from my late husband. The funds were accumulated during the war and my late husband was killed by rebel soldiers when attempting to take over the country. Before my husband was killed, he purloined some large sum of money from the Central Bank of the former Zaire  Republic of Sierra- Leone, and deposited the money in a security and finance company here in the United States.  I have the money when I search for it and when the war is over. I have decided to give to charity organizations that will assist the less privileged in alleviating poverty in Africa and the developing world.  I will be extremely happy if you help me to transfer this money out of Africa for the alleviation of poverty and development in general.  All I need from you is your trust.

I have a customer,  a Resident here in the UK, Late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh of  Belgravia,  (Germany) until his Death in a car Accident with his wife in Istanbul on  29th of May 2004.  He was a Geologist and the managing director of a Sierral Valley Industrial Co,  (S.V.I.O.C.) before his Death. He is here interred in the  morgue of the hospital here in the UK without any family or relative as he was  a relative of late Mineral Law  (FWMA)  Applicants must have made a valid Application for his death as all the  relevant documents relating to his Life were given to the hospital by his Family.  On the 21st of October 2003, the Malaysian  Airline 990 with full passengers Alan and on board, crashed into a(Shim)Minute (Shared)bank in  Istanbul,  killing all on board except for the pilot and  without any survivors. The aircraft was a direct  response to a request for assistance from the British Embassy,  Kuala Lumpur, Wanting to divert some of its attention from the problem at hand.  On further investigation, I found out that late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh was an Iraqi Refugee trapped in one of  the World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in  the year 2004, he died from the wounds received from the 2003 Arab  uprisings in Iraq and on further inquiries, I discovered that he died without making a WILL,  and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that  late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,  in particular his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  that late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh did not survive the Gulf War in Iraq and has been  mysteriously disappeared without a trace. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that  late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh did not leave any WILL or DIET, and all his  investments in the country have been confiscated by the government.  This means that all his investments in Iraq and other  African countries are now officially over by the government.  This means that my present proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to late Mr. Dara Çetuşeh so that the funds $21.5M (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars) will be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.

On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for 13.5 (fifteen) official working days, (two hours) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the Nigerian Ministry of Finance and in the Nigerian Agency for Energy, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. The amount in question is USD$15 Million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars). No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was deposited in your Bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you and the remaining 20% for any expences both may incure during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality . I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Barry Kelly when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response immediately via my telephone number +234-1-7756-079.

OSAUNDU(ESQ) ATTN:SIR/CEO/DIRECTOR/CEO/C.E.O/PRESIDENT/AGENT I am Mr. Dara Osondu of the Sierra Leone mining corporation, my colleagues and I are humanitarians based in Abidjan and Cote D' Ivoire. We are involved in a major mine disaster that has claimed the lives of more than 200 people. The disaster occurred on the 29th of October, 2005, in my company,I killed my normal partner (a.k.a. public enemy #2) by accident in one of our contracts slayings. Since we have not known what is going on in a community especially one that is run by the government, we were ordered by the President of Liberia to leave the country as soon as possible for our safety and our lives. We got to Liberia because of the help of a diplomat who gave us information about a valuable company in Thailand which owns a gem mine which has a core mine area of about 25,000.000.00 (26,000,000.00) persons. That was the amount. I immediately made arrangements to leave the country and contacted my office here to seek for asylum. Unfortunately my request was refused and again I contacted the office to seek for my family as my colleagues and I. are currently wanted in Thailand for the killing of my colleagues and I. by the Thai government. After a vain attempt at diplomatic efforts,I located a family friend who is a pro-government politician and he is currently on trial for the murder of my colleagues.I made arrangements with him and the two of us who are currently on trial to move some of my colleagues' money to Thailand which was registered in his name. I have in my custody the sum of USD$15 Million (Fifteen Million United state Dollars). I will like you to assist in repatriating this money to your country for investment purposes. You will also help me to settle in Thailand for investment purposes. I have all necessary documents covering the deposit and the approval to the bank in Thailand for the withdrawal of the funds. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We bargain that you will give us 20% of the total money for your assistance, 5% will be set aside for expenses in the course of the transaction and the balance 70% will be for us.

Title:  Greeting   in the name of our dear late colleague.
  Greeting   in the name of our dear late colleague. Dear Friend, My name is Dr. Kamal Mohamed, I am on sabbatical leave from the Africa Society here in Nigeria. I have a client who wants to invest in Eurozone, and he will want to do it in your country or anywhere else you think is stable, safe and politically stable. I have advised him on political and economic developments in Africa and Africa generally but he refuses to listen to advice and he keeps pressing me to invest in Africa. Finally, I gave up trying to help him and instead directed my attention to his money, especially to African countries where there is political instability, terrorism and natural disasters. Africa is not a land of peace and prosperity for the majority of people, there is a widespread civil disturbance and rebellion which the government is not doing enough to deal with. In my opinion, this is a good opportunity for you to help me transfer the total sum of US$23,500,000.00 (Twenty-Three Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This fund was a residue money from the purchase of goods and services from multiple countries in the African region, mainly due to the increase in black unemployment.  Last year, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Express Road.  All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives along with the driver.  I have successfully moved the money out of Africa for safekeeping, investment and so that my children can continue their education.  Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and legal according to my contract with my home government.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly.

Title: FROM  MISS FRENE T. OTU
 FROM  MISS FRENE T. OTU FRENE T. OUN: Greeting  Readers, I must not hesitate to confide in you this simple and sincere request business for our mutual benefit. I am Miss. Federa Torro da Silva, the wife of the former President of Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo) Laurent Kabila. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the investment of my family and the support of my children in your country. D.R.A.D. was a feudal kingdom in the Democratic Republic of Congo prior to the war in my country which resulted in the death of my husband President Kabila. Before the death of my husband, he had taken to the United Nation (UN) to demand that the D.R.A.D. hand over all the money they have in the country to the UN for arms and ammunition. The money in question is a huge sum of money which was realised from the sale of diamonds and minerals, and the management fee on the sales of the diamonds and the management fee on the management fee has been fixed at the end of each year since 1996. Before the introduction of the new constitution in the Democratic republic of Congo in the lead-up to the new mandate from the UN, the new president made arrangement with the chief of the general staff of the army to arm- ine the people's militia of the Democratic Republic of Congo army and disband the old one. This was to bring back the country back under the control of the new civilian administration. This mandate was successfully carried out and the money was handed over to the UNMILO. The UNMILO management is composed of civil servants from all over the world who have specialised in transactions involving multilateral development assistance. The main job of the management at the end of the year is to recommend to the governments of the multilateral development banks the sum of USD64,000,000.00 (forty-ninthousand united states dollars). If the sum of USD64,000,000.00 is handed to the governments, they will use it to purchase goods and services in the market, and to help fund the purchase of new goods and services which will further enhance the life of the governments involved. In order to avoid this, my family and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the money as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds and then sent to you as the beneficiary next of kin. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance. Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct fax number 234-1-7756759. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Miss Federa Torro da Silva.

  Urgent  Assistance . Dear Sir, I am Zuhair Idris ,the son of late former Director of SADDAM CHAMBERS of Africa, who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in office.In my country, the Civilian SADDAM CHAMBERS of the present military administration have been dethroned and replaced by a new organization, the United Nation (UN) . The stated aim of this organization is to check-mating military dictatorships and keep humanitarian aid high priority in the sub-Saharan Africa compared with other regions of the world. In my country, the United Nation has added Sierra-Leone to its war crimes blacklist. This move has resulted in the suspension or freezing of a lot of business and investment in Africa, South Asia, and the Pacific. The United Nation ( UN) has also demanded that all African Heads of Governments and parastatals restore all foreign donor funds and parcelling them out to African Nations. This move has been spurred on by the increasing tension in Africa and the failure of the former President of Sierra-Leone Salee Fofana of Sierra-Leone to come to the aid of the new African Heads of Government as they neared power. The money in question is being frozen because it is a public fund and therefore a "SADDAM CHAMBERS BLESS" is required before it can be moved out of Sierra-Leone.

I am Mr. Heidemarie Bongani, an attorney of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of approximately US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty million united state) deposited by a company of which I was one of the directors before my being compelled to resign from the company due to pressure from my superior officers. The money was originally meant for purchase of new machinery for export sector in the country, which we have been doing fine for the past ten years. However, after the visit by one of my Foreign Sales Manager who had visited the previous year, we were compelled to transfer the funds out of the country due to the changes in the law and regulations governing the industry.

 Business Transaction Dear Sir/Madam, I am Dr.Farah al-Hashemi, an accountant of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum (Maj-PBP) and a member of the Contract Review Panel set up by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum in June 2003 under the new civilian dispensation to review all previous and subsequent contracts in our departments from where the funds were originally raised. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge amount of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of the Ministry of Petroleum in favour of Hawala Bank of South Africa in favor of the firm Larsen & Toubro International (L&T).The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$22,500,000.00 (Twenty two million, five hundred thousand United States dollars).This amount was duly transferred into the Larsen & Toubro account of our choice without our knowledge or involvement.The original contractors have since been paid by the South African Government,but a large amount remains unclaimed.It is our belief that the true owner of the funds will want to be the beneficiary of the funds so that he/she can continue his/her employment with the firm in our favor. We have concluded all arrangement with the South African Law Firm to seek for the arrest of the original contractor so that the funds can be paid to you in your favor. We have all the necessary evidence which can be used to back up our claim as the beneficiary of the funds. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us transfer the funds out for us to invest in your country or anywhere else you prefer. You can contact me on my confidential email address for further directive. I have space for one more important information which should be included in your reply including your private Tel,Fax,Mobile and fax number. This is to enable me write to you formally and formally request for the release of the funds from the bank. I will need to hear from you directly on the phone or in person before a final decision is reached. I expect your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Dr.Farah al-Hashemi

 URGENT ASSISTANCE. Dear, I am Dr.Sunil Paul the Director of the PACKH (Protection of  Government Contracts) and a member of the Contract Review Panel set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contract for the supply of goods and services. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very sensitive transaction,which involves the supply of goods and the transfer of funds to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of various private contractors,the original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of USD$25,500,000.00 (twenty-five million united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be supplied,provided you kindly undertake to help us in transferring this fund to your account or alternatively help us to transfer it out of the Federal Ministry of Works and housing,where this fund is kept waiting for payment. It may also interest you to know that two years ago a similar transaction was carried out with the help of a reliable and trustworthy person,the Nigerian Government Accounting Service (FAS) which was assuring us on receipt of the funds that the work would be successfully concluded within ten official working days. Unfortunately, as the years passed and the management changed,some of the old guard colleagues of Mr.Mukah (the original contractor) abandoned their posts and left the firm without the receipt of their contract money,in contravention of contract law.This led to the total cancellation of the project. As a private firm with offices in both Nigeria and England, we could not supply the funds,we were left with no option than to seek for help from the public.I contacted you based on agreement with my lawyer from England who is presently with the Nigerian Government Accounting Service (FAS). This is simple,I will like you to provide a safe account into which the funds will be transferred because the FAS lawyers will require an account where the funds will be transferred into for investment purposes. They will require an account where the funds will be transferred into because the FAS lawyers will not require an account where the funds will be transferred into. I am giving you this offer because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account,unless someone offers me to provide an account where the funds will be transferred.I want to be absolutely sure about your willingness to assist me and my family before i will let you know to help us.The contract worth of US$25,500,000.00 has been successfully executed and the contractually agreed percentage of 80% is being paid to you as your share. All legal documents covering the contract have been done by the Australian Law Firm,we have assurance that the fund will be out of your country within 7 (seven) days of the transfer of the funds to your account. If you are interested,please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

The U.A.I has linked up with the British legal aid organisation and the United Nation to assist in his defence fund his family. The Iraqi government has started an investigation into his account and found out that he has no next of kin. The report of investigation was forwarded to the Iraqi legal aid organisation for possible claim for the support it may have rendered to the Iraqi president during the crisis. The money is now in the government warehouse and the security company is no longer doing business in Iraq. The security firm is no longer operating in Iraq because the government has started to take proper care of all the former government officials and the businesses in Iraq has become a back up to the international banks. As a result of this development, the family of former president Sadaf al-Jubilee has become a target of the insurgents. In view of this, the family of former president Sadaf al-Jubilee has decided to transfer my late husband's share into a foreign account. I have applied for asylum in the European country, through which the funds can be transfered out. On the approval of the Iraqi government, the money will be delivered to you if you help to clear and settle the money in your country.

We are seeking your assistance to the transfer of US$21.5M (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars) into your account. The Money came as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Company. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$179,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States  Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a South African firm, which we found out about from the media. We found out that the contract was awarded for a contract that never was awarded because the South African  Audit Office ruled that the contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$31,500,000.00 (Thirty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars). The Government Accounting Office has the power to request for reimbursement of this amount to any company that has declared it in their account, and if we find ourselves in a similar situation after the fact, we will most certainly include our share in the contract award and remittment to your Company's account. There is no risk involved, the information on this business will be carefully worked out and there is no risk involved at all.

MY COLLEAGUE AND I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. J.H. Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. J.H. Williams died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. J.H. Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$14,000,000.00 has carefully and carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal to you is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. J.H. Williams so that the money will be released from my bank.  What I want you to do is to provide a safe account into which the money will be transferred since Government officials do not have the same banking procedures as normal people. Secondly, I want you to sign and confirm a power of attorney that will authorise you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the power of attorney will be valid and legitimate. Finally, I will like you to contribute 20% of the total sum to my charity organisation, the beneficiaries will be as follows: 5% for the purchase of new machinery and 5% for expenses incurred in the course of the business transaction.  Please acknowledge receipt of this proposal by e-mail  anonymously via my alternative email: mkayobi@yahoo.com.br  Best Regards MR, JAMES KABILA

 Deliver Dear Friend In good health and in a position of trust, I write to you with great tears for this petition to solicit for your urgent assistance. My name is Mr. Nuh, a sierra Leonie. I am the son of late former Minister of Mines and Energy in the Government of Mr. Duncan Nuh who died two year ago since the rebels repressed the former President of sierra Leone, Joseph Laurent. Before my father was killed, he was able to move out of the country due to the presence of my mother and two elder brothers. Before his father was killed, he was able to move out of the country due to the presence of my mother and two elder brothers. But before my father was killed he told me that he had made a secret move by mistake which he and my mother made to South Africa on their way to the United Arab Emirate for safe-keeping, worth of about US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty five million five hundred thousand dollars) to any of his country to invest our share in the best interest of my country as my life's self depends on it. Now I and my mother are seeking asylum in the United Arab Emirate, to avoid possible retribution from the rebels and the government as they say that our lives are in danger because of our condition in the country. Consequently, we need a good partner who can assist us investing this fund in a suitable business, because the United Arab Emirate does not know the active condition of this fund in our country due to its last year of its last decree of appropriation and as such we are having every information and document needed to enable us move this fund out of South Africa. At the present time, the fund is in my father's possession and will be released by the bank once I get assurances and commitment from you to invest the fund in a lucrative business in your country.

At the moment, I am having discussions with my legal and moral adviser to plan how we can move this money out of South Africa.
