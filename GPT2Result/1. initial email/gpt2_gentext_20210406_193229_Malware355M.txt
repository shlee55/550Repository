Title: INVESTMENT CONSULTATION TO MY NAME
 INVESTMENT CONSULTATION TO MY NAME Dear Sir,   My name is Dr. Simeon Apple, the auditor general of  Central Bank of Nigeria. I write you in respect of an account that  might interest you. It may interest you as well to know that I was the account officer to  the deputy chief air traffic controller of Abuja Air Traffic Control  not far from here in Lagos who was involved in an air crash. The accident occurred on the 23rd  of April 2000. while on transit to Dakar Senegal. Below is a picture taken by my  colleague while we are on duty. It is a frame from an Italian news agency but you can  verify it is real by going to news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since then I have made several inquires to trace the relation of Mr. and Mrs. David Ingrams to the  incident but to no avail. It is because of the uncertainty of knowing the real owner of the funds that the  government of Nigeria has made arrangement in the European campaign to track the fund to any of the 204 accountants that the government has told my  colleague and myself to look for any of his next of kin. Having investigated further into the matter, I found out that Mr. and Mrs. David Ingrams died without a Will but they may have left behind some of their fund with a security firm in  Europe. These funds are some of millions of dollars that have been floating around for some years now. It is not clear to me which accountants are still holding the funds for the government. I would like to know now how much of the funds remain in the account of the government and which is being controlled by me now and later in the year. If it is not, I will request that the government should release the funds to me. If this transaction is not acceptable to you, then kindly, I beg you in the Name of God Almighty, inform me on his e-mail address so that I will explain to you what to do. I shall apply the appropriate channels of contact to reach you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Dr. Apple

 VERY URGENT REPLY NEEDED PLEASE. FROM: Rev. Gregory M. Lee LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Friend,                                (rev_greg_lee.)                                          (rev_greg_lee) I was born in Lagos, is now living in Nigeria, and was the second of three children. My father was the first and only Baptist pastor of our church in the city of Lagos, who died in the year 2000. Before his death on 1st September 2002, my mother died while she was giving birth to my father's second child. My father deposited the sum of $15.5million (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security company in Cotonou, Benin.After the death of my father, I went to my father's home country of Benin to seek for a reliable foreigner to stand as my guardian and next of kin to my mother. He told me that in a few days, he will re-marry with his first wife and they will both reach the age of 60. I then sought for an intercountry partner to carry out the business with me and partner abroad.As soon as I accepted his offer, I started by getting in touch with a security company and arranging the banking and financial details on how the money will be secured into an account in your name. Then I sent a copy of the contract between me and the company to your name so that you will prepare the documents and letter of application. Finally, I told you where I kept my share (50.5%) and what percentage (25%) will be for my own protection. I told you that 75% (25%) will be for you. I will give you a further 25% on all contingencies as you may consider in your private Chambers. I remain, Sincerely, Rev. Gregory M. Lee. ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: TRANSFER OF ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS)
 TRANSFER OF ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) Dear Sir, With Due Regard I wish to Apology and Request for Assistance in this matter. I am a staff in the Accountant General of Nigeria (A.G.) with the rank of assistant to the president of the A.G. Late Mr. General Sani Abacha the head of state. I was on duty on the 11th of April 2002 when my boss, my boss came down to Mobile from a trip to Trinidad and Tobago where he was having a private meeting with some African leaders where he made a lot of political patronage deal. At the meeting, he made a deal with one of the leaders that if he is reelected President of Nigeria next year, he will give him (my boss) the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) for every job he does while in office. As the president of the A.G. now, he knows that he will get this money from time to time when he is in the country. As soon as the money was conveyed to my boss office, he called me on his bed side and told me that he has the money in his vault. I then proceeded to the vault and found the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) in there with the papers of my boss. I demanded where my boss got the money from and he told me that he deposited the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) with a security company in Europe. I then contacted the Nigeria International Development Co-operation (N.IDC) whose chairperson is Mr. Rashid Aloane. He told me that he will kindly give me the necessary information and direction to the security company where the rest of the money is being kept now. That was how we were able to locate the said security company. We will be coming over to Nigeria in due course, after we have processed all the paperwork and are give us the necessary directions. Please, treat with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. I hope that this proposal-offering-and-promotion-from-your-particular-of-your-interest-gets-agreed-with-you-as-soon-as-possible. Again, I await your urgent reply- Beloved in Christ, MRS. SUSAN F. KABILA. Disclaimer: This e-mail is 100% legitimate.

My late father was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.). He died since the beginning of the year 1999. Before his death, he deposited some cash of $15.5 million (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). with Security company in Europe. He also told me that he used my name as his next of kin to get this money, that he intended to use the money for investment. But he was assasinated during a military coup d'etat in Liberia by the rebels. Since then, no one knows about this deposit or the money in the Security company. I am only contacting you, as a foreigner, to stand as the next of kin to this money because the government here in Sierra Leone do not recognize your identity and cannot approveof your claim. I have all the documents and proof that proves that you are my next of kin. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that willprotect your identity.

Title: CALL ME.
 CALL ME. MY NAME IS MR FRANK ALVY,I WORK AT THE BANK OF AFRICA (BOA).I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE,MUST BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CAME TO KNOW YOU,LIKELY,LIKE TO THE POINT THAT YOU ARE A VERY HONEST AND REPUTABLE PERSON,BECAUSE I WORK AT THE BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). I WORKED WITH THE FORIEGN,SIR/MADAM,FOR MORE THAN A YEARS. ONE OF OUR COUPLES HAD A VERY LARGE OF CONTRACTS WHICH COLLUSED TO MAKE UP ABOUT 4.5M US DOLLARS. SINCE ABOUT 1990, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EXTINGINGUISHING THE RATIO OF PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE FORIEGN. IN MY COUNTRY,BENIN,THE RATIO OF PAYMENTS HAS CHANGED MOST REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THE FUNDS ARE FOREIGN CODED CONTRACTS OR THE FACT THAT THE FUNDS ARE FROM FOREIGN CONTRACTORS. THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT ANY CONTRACT THAT IS USED IN BANKING MUST BE CHARGE TO THE BANK BY ITS FULL TERMS PERIODS,AND THE MONEY WILL BE REMMITTED INTO THE BANK AS UNCLAIMED FUNDS. HOWEVER,I WORKED WITH THE FORIEGN,SIR/MADAM,ONCE THE POSITION OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE ASKED US TO ARMIY A CONTRACT FOR THE UNCLARIFIED MINING OF ALL THE  CONTRACTS WHICH WE CONSIGNED. DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION,IN THE COMFORT OF OTHERWISE, WE KEPT SOME OF OUR FUNDS AND MOVED THEM OVER TO OTHER BANKS. THE AREA OF THE GAME HERE IS THAT NECESSARY COORDINATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY CAME IN THE RATIO OF THE BANK AND THE FORIEGN. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN CLEARED AND IS NOW IN THE RATIO OF THE BANK AND THE FORIEGN. THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT ANY CONTRACT THAT IS USED IN BANKING MUST BE CHARGE TO THE BANK BY ITS FULL TERMS PERIODS,AND THE MONEY WILL BE REMMITTED INTO THE BANK AS UNCLAIMED FUNDS. HOWEVER,I WORKED WITH THE FORIEGN,SIR/MADAM,ONCE THE POSITION OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE ASKED US TO ARMIY A CONTRACT FOR THE UNCLARIFIED MINING OF ALL THE  CONTRACTS WHICH WE CONSIGNED. DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION,IN THE GLORY OF THE POSITION OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE ASKING US TO CARRY OUT AN ARPUBATE WERE THE BANK AND FORIEGN OFFICIALLY MANDATED US TO CARRY OUT AN ARPUBATE. WE WERE GOING TO COMPENSATE FOR OUR EFFORTS BY APPLYING FOR CLAIMS OF THE MONEY BUT THE AGREEMENT HERE PROVES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLARIFIED AFTER SIX YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUNDS. IT IS TO THIS THAT I AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN MY  DEPARTMENT AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE. I SHALL DIRECT YOU ON HOW THE MONEY WILL BE REMMITTED. I SHALL SEND ALSO TO YOU BY FAX AND EMAIL THE DOCUMENTS THAT COVERAGE THE MONEY. I WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS TO SEND TO YOU AFTER THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN REMMITTED. I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THE NEED FOR URGENT INTERNATIONAL PORTENTIAL NOTIFICATION WHICH MEANS THE TRANSFER WILL NOT TAKE FEW DAYS AND THAT YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.  PLEASE, YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS SUBPRET INFORMATION SECRET AND PUT SUSPENCE ON THE INVESTMENT.  I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR IMMEDIATE REPLY.YOU CAN ALWAYS REACH ME WITH THE EMAIL ADDRESS  https://mail.uu

Title: TRUST REQUEST
 TRUST REQUEST Dear Sir, TRUST REQUEST. TRUST REQUEST. I am Mr.James M Thompson, a lawyer. I am a solicitor licensed in Lagos State of Nigeria. I was a private lawyer to the elder R. R. Thompson the present Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy under the President of Nigeria  who is also my client and current position as a lawyer in Lagos State of Nigeria. There were some big problems on the 21st of May 2000 when the then current President of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, made a decree to allocate funds to all the national and International organizations who are credited with remedying the messes caused by the former President of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. All funds, will be shared according to the percentages indicated. The funds were allocated to various agencies and departments of the federal government and National  International Cooperation Bureau in the form of grant. This decree has actually been in force since then and the people of Nigeria know very well that there are alot of grants being procured by foreign contractors for various projects. In order to avoid this, before I got the information about your email to contact you, I had to verify if you are able to handle such amount of funds. Based on the amount of $372 Million US Dollars which I had in my custody, I now decide to disclose the actual sum to you as regards to your honesty and trust. As regards to the program and the actual funds, I have to leave space in the above quoted sum for any form of accounting errors or omissions, which I will admit when I hear from you. My position as the lawyer in this matter now is that you can only contact me through my honest attorney in Lagos who is presently staying here in Lagos, who has the necessary legal documents which I will provide to you, and I will depend on you to be able to present yourself as the rightful next of kin of the fund. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% safe and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement has been made for the execution of the transaction. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail. I am waiting for your reply through my email address. This transaction should last for at least 6 months from the date of receipt of the following information through my email address: Your full name, Your private/company's email and phone numbers.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED Dear Sir/Madam I am Mr. JONES the Auditor General of  Southern Bank of Nigeria (SBON) Lagos. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you: On September 7, 1998, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation, Mr. JOE KOLY made an  application for a foreign customer (Mr. George  W.Brumley) to handle a contract worth $15,000,000.00 USD ( Fifteen million, seven hundred thousand US  dollars only) in his firm. After some trials and that of the whole process as being totally automatic and without any hitch. No human contact was necessary and the contract was explicitly concluded  without any hitch from the time it was signed. However, on the 21st of April 2001, Mr. George W.Brumley made a fixed deposit for 36 calendar months  in my bank and made the following deposit details:  A55   A55  (Amount $15,000,000.00 USD)                             (Top One),"I believe you understand, right? So, as the Accountant General of the National Petroleum Corporation of Nigeria, I acted as the "inventor" of the above mentioned contract and in my capacity as the accountant general of the company I was the only one who can legally claim this money (the contract) being transferred to my bank's security company in Africa. As the accountant general, I could have the account at my home or office. As it was, I shared the money with three other senior managers, who are also Members of the board of directors of the company. I also gave my opinion as well as the instructions to the three managers to keep this money (the contract) under my control. However, as it was, I decided to give up my current position and take a temporary position of partner with one of the other senior managers of the company because I don't want to run into any future conflicts of interest in this regard. Accordingly, I also decided to contribute part of this money (the contract) to the maintenance of our company and partner in Europe. Accordingly, in the event that you agree to work with me, you will be required to send me the following information: 1. Full Names: 2. Full Contact Address: 3. Full Name: Full Contact Address:  Full Name: Full Contact Address:  Full Name: Full Contact Address:  Full Name: Full Contact Address:  Full Name: Full Contact Address: I will request for your return statement, which will be prepared in your favour.

Thanks for your co-operation and patience. For your information, please send your reply to ae_christianb@yahoo.com Regards, Mr. JONES KOLY Est. 2.0 (on your response contact me).

Title: PLEASE REPLY TO DIAGRA 
 PLEASE REPLY TO DIAGRA  Dear Sir/Madam,   Invitation to  Reply when you`re  interested in working with me. I am  Mr. Shamsus Camus the manager of toilet chemicals  supply company in Nigeria.In the business,our company had a contract  worth (US$15.5M) of distributing Rial Group  coins to foreign customers in dollar amounts totaling $15.5m in one  package. Unfortunately, on the 23rd of April 2004,my company was hijacked and looted by armed  group which took over our Company's supply routes and also some of our  equipment. Following this action,we were forced to evacuate our Company Headquarters and  all our products and our investment abroad.I went to the Federal Government of Nigeria  to seek for asylum. After some months,I was granted refugee status and lodged in the Federal Government of Nigeria.I have since decided to contact you due to the safety and  security reasons I have based in Nigeria. I have applied for and been granted asylum on 3 separate occasions.On the 3nd of November 2002,I applied for asylum along with 3 other Top Government Officials and business leaders in the Nigerian  business world for a business venture which we will call  superior harmony.According to Nigerian Law,if you are the top official and the only person who knows of an  advantage in relation to this transaction,to the extent that you were the person who actually executed the  contract then you are legally allowed to have the advantage in relation to the money. The President of the Federal Government of Nigeria  gave my Project the green light to proceed with the green light to receive funds from  foreign contractors. The President also instructed that if it is not approved by the judge advocate who is the lawyer to the top Official of the Federal Government of Nigeria to continue with the execution of the contract.On the 6th of March 2005,it was signed by both parties and the contract was delivered. Since then we have been in constant communication with the Federal Government of Nigeria in relation to our  application for asylum.I have been given the task of securing the relevant documents and information required for  the Commissioner to rule on our application.It is my intention to use this money to establish superior harmony in relation to the Government of Nigeria and my position as the Attorney to the President of  the Federal Government of Nigeria. There is absolutely no risk involved,which is why I contacted you to assist in this project. As soon as I receive your willingness to participate in this project,I will provide the necessary documents and information which the Commissioner will need to make the  decision on our application. This project is 100% risk free,there is no way we can fail. On this note,please do send me your direct and private email address (shamsuscamus16@yahoo.com)so that we can proceed as soon as possible.   Please keep this project as top secret as you please. You can contact me through the above email address with your telephone and fax numbers.And finally,I would like to mention that if you are interested in assisting us,please indicate your phone and fax number in your reply to me.Please,NB: This project should not be confided on to the public for security reasons. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

ANDREAS SCHRANNER PULLED THIS COLLABORATION (CIVIL SERVICE COOPERATION) AWAY FROM THE BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM AND WITH THE INFORMATION THAT HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO OUR COUNTRY. I AGREE THAT 25% OF THIS MONEY IS FOR YOU AS A FOREIGN PARTNER, AND 50% FOR ME, WHILE 10% IS FOR EXPENSES BOTH PARTIES WOULD FACE AND CAUSED BY THE SUM OF (US$25,000,000.00) TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDREN FOR CIVIL SERVICE COOPERATION AND (US$50,000,000.00) FOR ANY INCALCULATION INCURRED IN COURSE OF THE BUSINESS. ALSO, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE MONEY BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES BE MANDATED BY THE PARTIES. IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I AM INVITING YOU FOR A BUSINESS DEAL WHERE THIS MONEY CAN BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. I HAVE WORKED OUT MODALITIES OF ACHIEVING 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM TO BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, WHILE 10% IS FOR EXPENSES INCURE DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFER ROUTINE. THIS MEAN WHILE THE REST IS FOR ME.  THE TRUST REQUIRED OF MOST OF US IN BUSINESS IS A HUGE PART OF THIS BUSINESS. I COULD HAVE KEPT THIS BUSINESS TO MY LIFE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS THERE ARE SPECULATIONS WHICH I MUST NOT OVER-ESTIMATE, SO I CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING AS A SURPRISE, I WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED. HOWEVER, I AM STILL HAPPY, HAVING FUNNIES LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE I LEAR ABOUT THEM, WHICH I COULD HAVE DONE ALONGSIDE, BUT DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, I WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY DUE TO FEAR OF BEING CONFISCATED.  I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU, AND CONTACT YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SINCE NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN. I WILL SEND YOU THE NECESSARY MODALITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, INCLUDING MY PRIVATE E-MAIL ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS. I WILL ALSO WANT YOU TO KINDLY FURNISH ME WITH YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS AS WE ARE STILL IN BUSINESS QUARTER. PLEASE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP "TOP SECRET" AS WE ARE STILL IN BUSINESS PERIODS. I'VE WORKED OUT ALL MODALITIES FOR A RISK FREE TRANSFER. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I'VE GOT THE MOST PHYSIAN PERSON IN THE BUSINESS ASKING FOR YOUR URGENT RESPONSE. BEST REGARD, MRS. ANDREAS SCHRANNER. ____________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

He is the only son of late Mr. Laurent Stephen Martins a former  minister in the former president of Burkina Faso, who was a member of that country's top  decision making body, the Cotonou-Senegal high commission. You can verify this from the website  which I kindly obtained from a reliable source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since his departure from office, I have been pursued by the military junta of President Blaise Compaor to source for a reliable foreign partner to handle  all my offshore and foreign  account details so that we can transfer and release the sum of $7.5million dollars to your account once the problem has been  cleared up. To avoid any accident or misunderstanding, all we require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We have agreed that 30% of this money will go to you for your assistance in clearing all  necessary documents and signature/issuance for transfer of the money. 10% will go to any expenses incurred in the process of transfer. 5% (seventeen percent) will be set aside for all expenses as incurred during the process of transfer. We have likewise agreed that 70% should be for me.As soon as this fund gets into your account, you will be connected  to the process of transfer.  Please, be honest to me as soon as possible.

 REQUEST FOR URGENT REPLY Dear Friend, I know this letter may come to you as a surprise but please bear with us. We have a transaction which will benefit both of us. Please bear with us. I am Abdul Aziz the Manager of Bank of oushan Brunei,Our client is a foreigner and the Manager of Petro chemical service here in Brunei. He made a fixed deposit valued US 3.5M,(Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars only) on September 1998 for 36 months maturity, with a value of US$3.5M only. Upon maturity in 2002, the tune was finally changed and the account reposed to a company registered in Europe. Unfortunately, this development cost my client his life in the line of duty. During the course of our investigation and the company being shipped out of Europe, we uncovered an account with a balance of US$10.5million dollars which belongs to one of our foreign customer who perished with his family in the Air France concord plane crash on August 31,2000. Since then we have made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of our customers extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.After several unsuccessful attempts to locate any of our customers relation or relative, we decided to contact your assistance in getting this funds (US$10.5million dollars) out of the country and out of the Embassy for us to have this fund (US$10.5million dollars) deposited into your account.The Embassy can release the funds to any foreigner if the order is issued to do so by our client.By law we are obligated to move this money into any of our client's account, if we determine that the account cannot be operated by the client, we will release the funds to our client. I have obtained from the books that this client has no next of kin and that is the only person that can claim this fund from our bank. We are not allowed to operate any account with any name that endorses this account, the senior officials in the office that authorises this account to be operated by a foreigner will demand to know the next of kin of the deceased, if you are the only person that knows of this account, you will have to give the name and address of the account so that the funds will be released to you.I have contacted the information available in the internet to locate any relative of the deceased that can claim this fund,but this information is classified and may be classified as TOP SECRET.You will have to contact me directly as the attorney to solicit for your assistance in this matter. Leaving your contact details and your confidential phone number for me to contact you will enable me relax the usual procedures in completing this transaction. I have the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we might make.I have further decided that the majority of this money will be for you, if you will cooperate fully with me,we shall utilize our share to secure our wish list items and other related fees. If you are interested in this transaction,please reply to my private email address;and be rest assured that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please contact me immediately via the email below and let me tell you the details that will enable us further discuss on the course of action to be taken.

Title: TREAT AS URGENT PLEASE PASSED THROUGH
 TREAT AS URGENT PLEASE PASSED THROUGH FROM THE DESK OF JERRY EVANS (ATTORNEY GENERAL BANK OF AFRICA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. EMAIL:jerg_v_ar@yahoo.com Dear Sir, With deepest respect and humble admiration for your efforts in this matter, I am JERRY EVANS the attorney general of Burkina Faso-West Africa, and I solicit your pardon for my speech. I have a confidential proposal for you that will be of immense benefit to both of us. Before the current ruler of this country, president Laurent D. Kabila, took office, he deposited a huge sum of money (US$25.5m) with an international security firm in a banker in Lagos-Nigeria. And although he is still in office, he did not declare any next of kin to this fund because he is the president. And as the attorney general of Burkina Faso-West Africa, I was the only one who knew about this deposit, and I acted accordingly by sending a notification to the security company which is the official time and dateline for the deposit. However, I do not need to tell you that this transaction is 100% confidential and it is not illegal. Barris Otunja, the head of security for one of the African countries, confirmed the validity of this deposit prior to his ascension to power in my country. And he is the man who introduced me to him, not only as a foreigner but also as the highly respected lawyer who had represented him in my country's top court. So, I cannot directly access this deposit as next of kin to President Laurent D. Kabila, but I can still claim it as the next of kin to President John Taylor Berg, who is the brother of the former head of state, president Charles Taylor. And I already have in my possession the certificate of deposit issued to me by the security company as the next of kin, which I will use to claim this money from the bank. As a matter of fact, I already have the money in my possession. It will take me no more than this that I will like to do, as I have all the legal documents to claim this money. What I need is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence the process of filing claims with you and the money. I will then employ the services of a lawyer to draft the necessary documents and affidavits and to obtain the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the money to the name of your brother. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and the remaining 5% for any costs or incidental expenses(You may be aware that are not included in the quoted amount)between me and you and the attorney. I need not emphasize to you that this is 100% legal and 100% legal. This is a high risk, high reward transaction that I will not fail to inform you of. So please give me your full contact details so that I can introduce you to my brother and explain further. I look forward to your response through your confidential email address as my reply via email will be appreciated. Yours faithfully, JERRY EVANS Email:jerg_v_ar@yahoo.com ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Title: Attn: Friend from Simon Katanga
 Attn: Friend from Simon Katanga Dear Friend, I am Mr.Simon Katanga a citizen of South Africa and currently residing in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa. I work with a company in a neighbouring country and have a service contract with the South African Government. My role is to render assistance to a foreigner who is being persecuted in his country as a result of the political crisis in my country. In order to avert this from coming to an end, he has appealed the South African Government to send his American wife and children as refugees to South Africa. During the current crisis in my country, several prominent individuals have been involved in the killing and actualisation of plans to overthrow the government. Parola Williams, the former Minister of Information and a close associate of the president, appointed his brother and chief adviser to the Presidency, Lord Lothian to preside over the execution of the contracts. In order to avert this development, his group secretly moved out a stash of US$8.5 million dollars (Eight million five hundred thousand United States dollars) to a neighbouring country, and made arrangements for the later release of the funds to any foreign, local or foreign company that comes to claim the funds. Unfortunately, this development has brought about the deaths of some of my clients including her husband, both of them tyrants. My struggle to save my clients life has been fruitfull. Due to this, her plan has been aborted. It is this that brought me to consider for my clients assistance in sending the funds abroad. Also, my own private investigation proved to me as well that her family is not aware of this development and the funds are now floating around the world. It is quite obvious to me as well that with the position of this government as well as the knowledge that some of my clients associates have, they may well plot a strategy to get rid of me. As it is, I do not need any foreign contact in this regard because with the existence of my private investigation, I already know where the funds are presently being kept. I have therefore decided to contact you on this matter, having investigated further and definitely established that he is with us, and be assisting you by rendering assistance with the funds. The reason why I seek your assistance on this matter is the fact that my clients family is presently on a government bail in South Africa, pending when they shall turn up for their next of kin. Consequently, I can safely let you know that we shall use this money to enable my group to claim this money from the South African Government and subsequently brought to your country. This is necessary in order to avoid South Africa from confiscating our funds. Due to the government's growing paranoia and unwarranted harassment of my family, we have located a reliable safe haven. I am waiting for your response to enable me contact any of the competent counsel to render us the needed details and also inform you on your legal rights to claim this money. Please include your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. As soon as I receive your response, I shall provide you with the necessary details and information that will enable you apply for the claim of this money. Please refer to our website for more information regarding this crisis in my country. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Hello. Please I apologize for any inconvenience.

The business has been very successful and the couple have diversified their diamond business into other valuable businesses.The business we wish to introduce to you is a diamond business, mainly to the African countries,because the management of African countries is rather more demanding on one's resources, the management of the operations of Diamond and Gold stores is more demanding on one's resources, and the management of the Bank of Africa is much more lenient on one's resources. As it stands now, My father was able to accumulate a huge amount of accumulated accumulated wealth from his business without any problem on his part. But as it pertains to you, as a newscaster or columnist in any reputable newspaper here in Africa, it may come to you as a shock to you, but my father was able to accumulate a huge amount of accumulated wealth from his business in the post office, and the security and finance companies as well.

 ASSISTANCE Good day, Duran. I write you this proposal in good faith, but I believe it is necessary to inform you of our purpose, reason for contacting you and how we intend to execute the transaction. We have been looking for a trustworthy and trustworthy partner to handle this transaction with us, as we cannot afford any breach of the law of trust here in Ghana. It may sound strange to you but trust is something we have to share, and trust is something we live our lives striving for. We as civil servants are expected to conduct ourselves with utmost confidentiality and integrity, and fairness is of importance to us. We have been entrusted with some very sensitive documents that require a absolute absolute utmost confidentiality and integrity within our organization. Most concerned is the material. These documents contain the password of a file that has been in our custody for a very long time. The complete name, address, telephone and fax numbers for the file. This is the reason why I need your assistance. The file is a security classified file that contains data of a confidential nature. The file is cabinet made and not dissimilar to a paperwork that belongs to a head of state or head of government. It contains information that will enable the head of state or government to authorize the release of this money to you. It may interest you to know that I have been privileged to work with some very powerful people in my private capacity and I do not want this money to go into the hands of some despotic or un-worthy person. I want you to be absolutely certain that you are 100% certain that this transaction is not a fluke and that you are the only person that knows about this particular file. For your assistance, I am prepared to compensate you with 5% (5%) of the total amount of the funds, while the remaining 80% will be for me. Please, you must not get discouraged and keep pushing forward, as this can only be concluded with the assistance of a well-connected and reputable person who can assist you with all the necessary modalities for the successful execution of this transaction. I will provide the details, but rest assured that this transaction will benefit both of us. If you are interested in assisting us, please contact me as soon as possible, as soon as possible. Your contact details and contact information as well as the password of the file will be carefully considered. If you are interested, we shall discuss in detail the transaction. Please keep this very confidential. Please also, note that the transaction must be concluded immediately for legal reasons because the head of state or head of government is not in the habit of keeping any large sums of money in his or her private account. Please also note that the transaction may be most profitable for both of us because I shall ask for your full information and address upon request, while the information shall be forwarded to you instantly through our secure faxline number for easy and effective communication. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation, and God bless, Duran. GORDON AYU. ___________________________________________________________ Deux moi vos plaisons! http://vosplaza.spaces.live.com

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY GOOD DAY FROM THE DESK OF EDWIN RYAN 170 DAISIE NIGERIA P.O. BOX 939 CHARLES KANE ROAD LAGOS-NIGERIA. KENYA. Attn:Dear Friend, I humbly wish to seek your partnership in a business venture that will be of immense benefit to both of us. I am Edwin R. Pryor, a citizen of Nigeria and the Manager of Petrochemical Service, a well-known and highly reputable company with its corporate offices in some of the major cities of the world. We have several hundred employees that work in our company, including some that are highly skilled and experienced in the field of chemical engineering. Along with the supply of chemicals to major cities in the world, our customers demand prompt delivery of their chemical products for sale. One such customer is the Nigerian Ministry of Mining and Resources where our customers are importing large quantities of crude oil for refineries. Several months ago, my clients A/C owners Mr. Abdul Hamid Azima and Mrs. Marian Musa both of whom are Government Officials visited my office and told me about a customer of ours that they plan to send to me later this month. His name is David Lewis of United Kingdom, and he is the Manager of Petrochemical Service, and he is presently on vacation in Lagos. On the 21st of July 2000, his wife, his only daughter and his wife were involved in a car accident along Sagamu-Nigeria Express Road. Unfortunately, David lost his life later that year in the same accident, and since then nobody has come forward to claim his funds of dollars Four years later, another Government official visited my office and told me that his Next of Kin was dead, and no one else knows about this either. The total amount involved is ($ 240 million USD). On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Abdul and Mrs. Marian had no children and that none of his business associates or his wife had any knowledge of this either. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to do business with you and seek your consent to engage in business with you, and also seek the consent of my lawyer to have you stand as the next ofkin to Mr. David Lewis so that the proceeds of this account now valued ($ 240 million USD) can be paid to your account. 60% to me as the transferee; while 10% to be used in settling expenses.

Before his death he deposited some amount of money (US$10,000,000.00) in a security company in Europe, which we are yet to receive a single payment from the government of Burkina Faso. and  we have no way of knowing that someone else will come along and claim this money from the government and claim it, since we cannot really trace our ancestors. I am prepared to enter into a joint business venture with you to claim the money and share it with me. As I am a staff in the bank  management I will negotiate the modalities for a successful conclusion of this transaction. What we desire from you is assurance that you will receive at least 50% of the total amount of $10,000,000.00 after we have processed your accounts. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will furnish you with the details. Please treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality and confidentiality as our only customer is of paramount importance. You may also send me your confidential telephone and fax number to enable me reach you at any time. Again, this transaction requires absolute confidentiality, as all modalities for a successful conclusion of this transaction has been negotiated.

I write to seek your assistance to transfer out US$8.5MILLION (EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND US DOLLARS) from our foreign customer(s) account. It may interest you to know that my late client was the former Minister of Mines under the former Government of Mr. Laurent Desire. You shall read more about this case on the web site below: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Before my late client left office he made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, with an opening balance of US$12,500,000.00 with the ADB. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during his last months in office as the Minister. On the maturity date another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We got your phone contact from the database. According to the banking law and guidelines, the bank is allowed to require a third party to stand as next of kin to the account owner if the account owner is incapable of transferring the fund. Since the bank cannot compel any more from him, we have made a proposal to transfer the fund to a private firm on his behalf which shall file the necessary paperwork to the ADB and the UK Home Office. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to use this fund to finance the importation of agricultural machinery and chemicals to our country. We have all the documents in our possession to back up any claim we may make. All we need from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We have decided in favour of sharing this funds with you, if you agree to arbitrate. For your partnership you will be entitled to 30% of the funds while 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties may incur during the transaction. Please treat strictly as top secret and do not divulge the contents of this email to anyone. Please, you can contact me through my email address below or through the email address's above.

Title: PLEASE ASSIST
 PLEASE ASSIST I am Mr. Jim K, the Auditor General of  CITIC. I wrote to you as a person of integrity not to get involved in the matter of a foreigner depositing account with us. As someone who has worked with some of the most prestigious banks and financial institutions in the world I am well aware of the difficulties involved in tracking down the next of kin of an account holder of large amount of money. This is especially the case with accounts over a certain amount of money which often exceed the stated sum in question.

Title: URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE
 URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr. Dawud Abacha the eldest son of the former head of state Mr. Motse Edema of Sierra Leone. My late father was falsely accused of murder and had his head chopped off by the Sierra Leone military. My mother died when I was just 2 years old and since then my father took me so special. Before the death of my father on the 18th of February 2002 in a hospital here in the U. A. E. he secretly called my attention to a sum of money that he claimed was the sum of $15,000,000 million (Fifteen million united states dollars)and gave me the instructions to look for a reliable foreigner to assist in this transaction. He also told me that he can sue in court for the money if he wants to, and he also claimed that he has the ability to bring out the money from the vault here in here in the U. A. E. He also told me that he can sue in the press for the word "BUSH" to be used in the course of the transaction. He also insisted that I should use my position and influence to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations of the country I now intend to move to. He also told me that the reason why he was never tried for the murder of my mother was that the government of Sierra Leone does not believe that he is capable of carrying out such a heinous crime. He also told me that he had secretly cleared the money from the file of the finance firm where he worked.He also told me that he has all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim he may make. He also insisted that he use my name as the lawyer,sources of which he also gave me. I am contacting you because I want you to stand as the beneficiary of the funds and have your name used in place of my mother's when you are ready to execute the claim. He also demanded that you "show me your cards" for confirmation that you are capable of executing the claim. If you are willing to assist me I will disclose to you the details concerning the rights of the transaction. I will also give you 30% of the funds. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private e-mail address:dawudbaki@yahoo.com. For your reliable assistance, we are asking for 35% of the money while we are waiting for your response. If you are interested, please reply to this message indicating your availability. We await your response to enable us conclude the transaction as soon as possible.

Title: From Mr. JAYSH dhuchi
 From Mr. JAYSH dhuchi Dear Sir, Good day to you. My name is Mr. JAYSH dhuchi from Palestine, Palestine. I am the accountant general of a bank here in Palestine. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On May 12, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Government of  Iraq, Mr. Bassem Youssef who was based in Kuwait, flew to Kuwait to  visit his daughter. While in Kuwait, Mr. Bassem lodged an application for a Temporary Resident permit with the Embassy's  Office. On further investigation, it was  discovered that Mr. Bassem had no family or relations in Kuwait. The Embassy's office at the time of filing advised him of his inability to operate a  foreign account and will confiscate any such account at the expiration of 5 (five) years. The situation became more and more desperate as no other person knew about these accounts or any thing concerning them, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved it to be false. It is more than likely that this account is standing as the beneficiary of the late Mr. Basem Youssef who was a Foreign Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Iraqi Ministry of the petroleum Resources and Fuels. You shall read more about the Youssef family and the Youssef tragedy by visiting this website: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;vsms=cite&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;emc=islink&amp;amp;lt;lt;lul=http://www.pci.bar.ca.us/pcibarca/j/josephy5.html&amp;gt; please, send me your reply through this email address: jayeshdutch@netscape.net Please, kindly provide me the following informations to enable me start the process of our business: 1) Full Name. 2) Full Contact Address. 3) Mobile or Mobile PRIVATE phone and/or fax numbers. 4) Full Name for your country. I will need your full name and address so that I can use your name as the beneficiary to the account, or you may apply for it. After your full contact address and name, your contact address will be assigned so that your account manager will prepare an application and send it to you for your independent verification. I will use my position, influence and influence to effect the necessary arrangement for the transfer of the money to your original bank account in your country.

 REQUEST FOR YOUR URGENT REPLY NEEDED.  Dear Sir.                                                    CONFIDENTIAL AND REPUGNANT. I am Mr. James Amed, financial director of  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. I write you this proposal in good faith and with the hope that you will understand and  consider it seriously. I am writing to seek your partnership to handle a very  confidential and confidential transaction that could be of great benefit to both of us. It may sound  strange but exercise patience, as you will be rewarded with a deal that will be a win-win for both of us.This is a transaction that I and other officials in my position had in mind when we  decided to relocate to Nigeria. Our offices were infiltrated by a faction of the ruling party led by late  president Olusegun Obasanjo, leading to the arrests of some of our top officials.This led to our being targeted in the eyes of some sections of the  government who viewed us with suspicion.This led to my and my colleagues being targeted in the eyes of some sections of the government, which is the reason why we wrote to you and contacted you. We are currently facing trial in some courts in Nigeria and have our assets frozen and seized. This has resulted to the confiscation of our cash and other valuables as well. This sum of US$35M(Thirty Million United States Dollars) is in a security company overseas and the management is ready to move the funds to any secure location where they will be easier and more convenient for us. The amount is uncomfortably strong to be moving around, however I and other officials in my position have decided to transfer this amount to a foreign account, which is safer and more convenient for us, as you will be informed later. We are honestly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Please if you are interested in assisting us in this regard, kindly contact me as soon as possible via email address:james@o2.pl, such urgent and confidential matter.  Thanks and God bless you.

Title: PLEASE ASSIST
 PLEASE ASSIST Dear Sir I wish to beg your indulgence in this deal, I have worked with the Nigerian Government for almost 2 years now. I will give you a brief introduction to me and also give you some details of my company.I am O.C.S. Abraham a staff in the Nigeria Finance Corporation (NGFC) I am the personal account officer to Mr.Ronald "Pope" Koroma the former deputy minister of finance to President Spencer eise in Nigeria. He is suspected of having links to the Muslim religious order and it is for this reason that I took urgent measures to seek your consent to handle certain sums of money in order not to embarrass him or embarrass the government. My boss was arrested for his involvement in supporting the reformation movement which the UN has declared an 'intolerable' act. He is accused of siphoning money from the Consolidated Fund of the National Energy Corporation (C.N.E.C) to support his faithless decision to support the UNSC of UNED at its 1991 'World Conference on Peace' in Abuja, where he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Unfortunately, during the course of my duties as the account officer to President Spencer eise, I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. (British Pounds) on which the sum of £7,500,000.00 million was dormant for over 2 years. I then alerted the national security of the United Kingdom and of course the finance firm where the money was established, which I also brought to light just now. It is my duty to inform you of this development as the government and ministry has  officially acknowledged the existence of this account and it's relation with my boss. My Boss was arrested and charged under the G.O.C. (General Omitted Charge) against unterfüllungen funds and he is now being held in custody pending when the government will finally declassify this account and hand it over to the fund managers. While he was still under arrest, he made a multitude of statements to security officials, including the fact that the sum of £7.500,000.00 million was in his dormant account with a security company in Europe. He also declared the account dormant in his official papers including his official letter of claim to the Ministry of Finance. I am simply informing you of the facts of what I discovered, you can verify this from the website below which I discovered while I was investigation on this account.  http://www.dawodu.com/dawodu_04.html http://www.hinduonnet.com/forum/dawn/messages/message-ID=1264 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account has no other beneficiary and that both Donald and Elvin Koroma are dead as well. This sum of £7.500,000.00 million is still in the security company and there is no way it can be transferred to any account in this world. The cool part is that it can only be transferred to any account with a valid current account information, which I will give you later, but first you must apply for the claim to the security company. Please send your answers/declarations to me as soon as you receive this message.  Thanking you in advance, please reply to this mail box for more confidential processing.

Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY
 TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY Dear Friend, I am Indigeta Caro, the only daughter of late chief caro. I am presently undergoing trial in Lagos State of Nigeria where I am presently residing, while on trial for my role in the $10 Million Real Estate Development in my country. My late father was the general President of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN). He was in office for 4 years before he was assasinated in the corruption trial in Lagos. Being the only child of my father, I do not know what will happen to me at the end of my trials but I believe that God has a plan for this. My father was the president of the largest real estate development in the Nigeria area and he wanted to build a government owned real estate in Lagos and other important cities of Nigeria. He wanted me to look for a reliable foreign partner to assist in this project. I have the documents to back up my story and this is an accurate story. My Uncle Nelson was the former president of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN) while I was in school and he used my name as his associate in the Real Estate Development. I do not know what the circumstances of this development is at the moment but I will tell you later. As a matter of fact, I have already managed to get a government contracted company to assist me in this project. This project is based on trust so I need a reliable foreign partner to assist in this contract. As soon as this is concluded, you will be entitled to 30% of the total contract amount while the balance will be used by me to fund my future education and that of my family, if any. I would need your full cooperation to enable us achieve this project. Your position in the company will be from office of the Vice President through the President to enable us secure the necessary approvals and letter of origin from the relevant ministries for shipping to your bank. For your co-operation, you will receive 10%of the total contract amount while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that could be incurred during the process of the transaction. If this proposal is acceptable to you, feel free to reply. Yours Sincerely, Indigeta Caro. (SINCERELY,INDIGEATA CARO) N.B.

From: Mrs.My Name is Mrs. Mary Ellen. I work as a personal secretary to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). I got your contact through a friend who maintains the contact details below. Please keep this business proposal as a top secret unless you are interested. On January 12, 2002, Mr. Antonio Dembo, leader of UNITA, a splinter group of the Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Angola, made peace offering to Angola the sum of US$10.5 million, but was rebuffed. You can verify this from the Angola Peace Process website, http://www.abp.org/event/principles/index.html. Mr. Dembo made this offer in good faith, and with the support of some top officials in the government of Angola, he offered to sell off his share to pay the outstanding amount of dues and expenses by Angola National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that remained uncollected following the expiration of his tenure as leader of UNITA. The offer was rejected by the majority of the NNPC leadership and the remaining members continue to support Mr. Dembo as leader. You can verify this from the website below, which was published by the Angola Journal of November 2002. http://www.angolajournal.com/html/newsfrom_angola_m_2002.html http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/news/middle_east/3470238.stm As you can verify from the above website, I have all the necessary legal documents that will enable me lay claim to the funds and the government process will be well underway. All I need is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. For your cooperation, we have agreed to give you 30% of the funds while 10% shall be set aside for expenses both parties may incur during the process of this transaction. Please contact me urgently via my email address: mr_m_maryellen@hotmail.com Yours faithfully, Mrs. Mary Ellen. - Mrs. Mary Ellen - (for Mr. Mary Ellen) ------------------------------------------------------------ This e-mail message is sent by WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

I have the power of subpoena in this regard as the chairperson of the Bank Public Accounts Committee &gt; and the manager of the Public Accounts Department; and I have the power to compel to account &gt;profits being generated from funds that are currently floating in &gt; treasury accounts. In the course of my duties as a committee member &gt; I discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million U.S. Dollars (FIFTEEN MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire family on 22nd October 2001 in a plane crash.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website. Before the death of the customer (MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany), he was the manager of PETROL U.S.A. with a balance of 12.5 million U.S. Dollars.&gt;He was the Manager of PETROL U.S.A. until his death and has since been domiciled in Doha, Qatar with his wife and children.And they (his wife and children) were among the dead as a result of the plane crash of  31st Oct 2003 that took place in Cotonou, Benin before his sudden death. Since then I have made several inquires to seek for the next of kin of this customer who is a foreigner, this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his family members over the Internet and the results of this search have been posted below. Please, retain the confidentiality of this matter. &gt;From the above websites, I assume you are familiar with the problems &gt; of locating the relatives of deceased customers. &gt; In order to combat this problem, I have now decided to contact you and seek your consent to help me in the search of the next of kin of the deceased customer so that the proceeds of this account valued at $12.5 million U.S. Dollars can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. &gt;Please note that this transaction is 100% risk free. And if you are interested in assisting me, please email your address, private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and your private e-mail address so that I can include your banking information, which I will then use to send the necessary documents and details that will enable the bank transfer the total amount to you. &gt;Since you are currently unavailable for this transaction due to my not holding the bank Account, I hereby require your assistance in this regard. &gt;Please note that the sharing ratio in this case is 60:30. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

Title: Hello, Mr. john mohameed,
 Hello, Mr. john mohameed, When is the next date of your next of Kin?                                  http://www.my.com/web/about/what_do_us_do/mind_reading.asp?ID=20                   (U.S.A) Dear Sir,                  Please allow me to introduce myself. I am Mr. john mohameed a citizen of U.S.A. but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. I worked with a private banking group in the region for over four years. During this period, I transferred some amount of money to their accounts in Union Bank of West African and also a bank in the region. The source of this money was a contract which I executed with them. This contract called for the delivery of various supplies and services to various client in the region. The product which was finally delivered was very good and well received by all the parties involved. However, on the evening of the 22nd of April 2002, my clientele along with his entire family including his wife and children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives during the event. Since then I have been on a search for a reliable and trustworthy person who can assist me in this regard. While I was on the process of locating a relative, I discovered an account with Total sum of $10.5million (Ten million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars only) in a financial institution in Lagos and I believe you understand where this is going. The owner of this account is Mr. H. Lawrence "Bubba" Burns a citizen of USA, but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all was fruitless. The reason why I have not located anyone is because I have filed for political asylum with the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan. My position now as the head of state of Jordan mandates that I cannot operate an account in the USA. Consequently, the amount involved is (US$10.5million) Ten million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars only. I believe you understand where this is going.                   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm                     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm           http://www.msn.com/msn2/default.asp?rsp=M+20040721&amp;hmB=1&amp;pA=2&amp;mK=1&amp;mS=2&amp;mc=&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I write under the name Richard Lee. This is a business proposal. I work in my department as an account officer. I have an account with a bank here in the United Kingdom. On my official duties, I discovered an account with total sum of £15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million British Pounds only) with our bank. Upon closer investigation, it was discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank has collected all the account holders' information relating to the account, and has put together a memorial notice in the window of the account in question. Unfortunately, the information provided by the bank includes both full details of the account and account number. If this notice is sent to you, you will be required to provide a sample or other proof of account ownership or effective access to account, to enable the bank transfer the money to another bank account in Europe. The actual amount involved is (USD$15.500,000.00) fifteen million British Pounds only. I recommend that you seek for reliable foreign partner. I have decided to use this opportunity to solicit for your support

Title: Revived &amp; 
 Revived &amp;  FROM: WILLIAM OKONO   ABIDJAN COTE D�IVERY: 1802 BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)  LAGOS-NIGERIA. ATTN: Dear Sir,          I am the manager of bill and exchange at the bureau  of the overseas remittance  department of  BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) in   Cote d'Ivoire. I have an urgent and  very confidential business  proposition for you. On April 18, 1999, an American petroleum contractor working for  government of United States of America located in Lagos-Nigeria, Mr. Jeff Knudson made a numbered fixed deposit  for 6.5 years, with security company here in Nigeria, for  the sum of US$36,000,000.00(Thirty Six Million United States Dollars) with the Office of Comptroller and Auditor in  Nigeria. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even after the called time  indicated.  After 5 years the call came and the funds were called again. This time the money was  called because of a problem found in the account. On further investigation it was  discovered that Mr. Jeff Knudson and his wife were never in the same  household and no relation to any of his previous employers. This sum of US$36,000,000.00 is still sitting in the  Bank of Nigeria, and no-one will ever come forward to claim it. At this stage the matter is void of any legal consequences as there is  no body to rely on as proof of the existence of the deposit. The Comptroller and Auditor General of BANK  OF AFRICA (BOA) have examined and confirmed the existence of the  deposit in our records. It was therefore placed in the custody of the bank as unclaimed  fund. It is intended that this money be shared amongst the directors of the bank. If you are willing to accept this offer, you are required to immediately send to me your Full Names, Passport or Drivers License, your Permanent Address, Tel/Fax Numbers and your Tax Identification to enable us share the money among ourselves in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you while 10% should be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction. We will see what we can do together. If you are interested, send immediately your reply by email in the box below or you can send it to  me by mail on bofacountaddia@yahoo.com. Please note that this transaction is 100% hitch-free. If you are not interested, you shall be returned to me with your name or the account you are going to use to repopulate.  I ask that  you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality, and best of all, that you keep this transaction top secret. For your share in this deal you will be entitled to 40% of the money while 60% will be shared among me and my colleagues. This is to say, I ask that if you are interested in this deal, that you should contact me immediately ‒ gratuitously, whenever you receive this mail’ and arrange on a mutually agreed upon time (two weeks) before the commencement of the transaction to enable me commence my offer. Also, be informed that this transaction is 100% risk free.   From my position as the manager of bill and exchange at the bank, I have the power to influence the conclusion of the deal, as long as I can demonstrate that  my offer is worth the money in question. Based on the data collected from the customer, I am now prepared to enter into negotiations with you on the terms and conditions of the transaction, and what percentage of the money will be for me while the remaining 60% will be shared among I and my colleagues. Feel free to get in touch with me if you're interested to enable us discuss further.    As you may note, the above sum is in US Dollars. What I ask of you is to prove through evidence to me that you are capable of handling a transaction of this magnitude, and that you are not willing or able to play God. If you know you're capable of handling such a transaction, send me your confidential phone,fax and your full name and address so that I can contact you on the first practicable time so that we can agree on the percentage you will receive and share among myself and my colleagues.

Title: BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
 BUSINESS PROPOSAL. Dear Sir/Madam,  My name is Richard Barrow, a Solicitor and a Personal Attorney to late Mr.  George W.Brumley, a citizen of the united states of America who used to work with marine engineering service in  Charleston Charleston, South Carolina. Here in c Charleston ,South Carolina. On the 19th of April 2000, my client,his wife and their three children were involved in some car accident along Sag Harbor Blvd. E. of Charleston,South Carolina. Unfortunately, they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Before the death of my client, he deposited some amount of money in two security company in the U.S.A. amounting to (US$20.8M) Two Million, Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only. This money in question was intended for the establishment of a new marine engineering service in South Carolina. However, before his death, he told me that he kept this money in a security company in Europe. He told me that he will approve this money to any foreigner who will come over to claim the money because the European Government regulations stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after eighteen years, the money will be transfered into the government coffers as unclaimed fund For more details about the accident you can as well visit this website: http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/18/kenya.list/index.html Since then I have made several enquiries to the Security company in Europe to locate any of my clients extended Relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. I have contacted the foreign media to report on the incident, this has also proved humiliating for me. In order not to give up my quest for justice, I seek your consent to handle this money in a secure financial institution in your country. I have all the documents to back up this claim. All you need to do is to submit a self-addressed, completed and legally binding return envelope to the Security Company in Europe with your name and address so that they can pin the money to your account.  Please, if you are interested in assisting me, kindly as a matter of urgency send me the following information. 1. Full Name. 2. Permanent Address. 3. Cell Phone and Fax Numbers.  After you have submitted all the required information to the Security company, you will be contacted to nominate you as the next of kin to the deceased.  After you have been nominated, the money will be transferred into your account for us to share in the order of 50% to me and 40% to you. The amount in question is (US$20.8M). I have all the legal documents to back up this claim but it will take me some patience to gather all the legal documents that are required for this transaction. As soon as this money is in your custody, contact me on my confidential email address below.  Please, your replies to my email address above with your phone and Fax numbers will be sent to you.

I am the director of professional programs with my bank. The following is a list of accounts opened and  discharged in the past year. A bank official has inspected these  accounts and found out that the former manager of these accounts is Deepak Sharma, a former deputy minister of justicenation under  the former English &amp; British kings. He was on sick rest and declared self-drested in the Diplomatic  service for the past 6 years. and the accounts are worth ( US$19,000,000.00) It is this that i contacted you for your assistance in claiming the funds. The owner of this accounts is Chief MHA of the People's Liberation  Army (PLAA). His name is Mr. Michael Shephard a retired Chief MHA of PLAA and an avid camp dancer. He died in 2004. and since then nobody has done anything as regards the claims as the next of kin, because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of either the accounts or the funds. It may interest you to note that all the accounts and the funds are vacant now. This is why i requested for your assistance. You will be required to assist me as the next of kin to ascertain the account balance to claim the funds. The total amount involved is (19,000,000.00) Ten Million United State Dollars only. What we want from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above sum and we will claim the balance out from the Security Company at (EU) 021 Cotonou. All legal documents to back up your claim as the next of kin will be provided. There is no risk involved in the matter as we are going to assume all the legal documents from the Security Company. The details of how you will be required to claim this amount from the Security Company will be sent to you as soon as i receive a response. Your share of the funds will be split at the shares given to you by the two companies. Please, do reply me through my e-mail address:bargu_smith@yahoo.com as soon as you receive this message.

 From Mr. William Phillips Dear Sir/Madam I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a surprise,but with confidence I hope you consider it. I am William Phillips,The Manager of Bank of Africa (BOA) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of money (US$10.5million dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in December,2002 in a plane crash.Link to the website: www.sunoco.com since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and daughter) did not actually exist in our database and is probably lying in a hospital or dead.We will release the money to the bank if somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased but we want you to understand that nobody is coming for it because my bank management has notified me that he(the deceased) is dead,and nobody will come again for it. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years,the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund For the sake of transparency on this issue,I will like you to keep this matter very confidential and private. Your salary will be credited to your account for the transfer. I will need your full name and address,telephone and fax numbers to enable me verify your address.If you are interested,send your reply via the above fax number,to enable me send my picture for you to review and I will provide you with more details and how we will proceed with the transaction. Thanking for your co-operation. Yours Faithfully,                                               (Master William.Phillips) __________________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

 REQUEST FOR YOUR URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE NEEDED. FROM THE DESK OF MR.SHABULAUUKA _________________________________________________________________ Greeting, It is perhaps surprising to you that this mailbox is filled with emails from people we have not met before. However  this mailing list has grown to become quite the impressive one, and has the  indication of being a very influential and influential one. I am the Manager of list management here in eBay Canada. I have managed a very large and very  influential list within this list, which I believe is the best managed list in the whole  world. It is organized into several different categories and sub-categories, which I shall give you a brief of, but suffice it to say that the amount of subscribers to this list has gone through the roof, and the men and women who subscribed to this list have collectively sent an average of around 500 to our list every month for the past few years. The reason for this is simple, the owners of the listed items have died, and replaced by a new owner. The items on this list is now considered to be owned by the next of kin of the listed individuals, and therefore the items are considered owned by the new owner, and therefore subject to the same rules and policies as if they were owned by the old owner of the items. It is this process that enables you to play a very important role in the survival of the lists around particular items. As a matter of fact, the amount of items that have been bought and sold on this list is far exceeding the sum of CAD$15.500,000 (Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) as at September 2006. This is an increase of over 300% in the last 6 months alone. You should take a close look at the sub-categories of the list, as you can track down the deceased owners of the items. From my list, we can now add in some items that are currently on the market (such as a new model of Mauser C96 pistol), and that is now approaching the 15 million United States Dollars Limit. If you are interested in contributing to this list, please send me your name, address, telephone and fax numbers for easy and easy communication, as well as your current residential and business information to enable us work out the modalities. Please, note that all information is confidential, and treated with utmost secrecy. If you are interested, please reply to me immediately via my mailbox at: [email protected] Urgent response is appreciated. Yours Faithfully, Mr.SHABULAUUKA Email: manager@egyptair.com

Title: URGENT RESPONSE
 URGENT RESPONSE Dear Sir, I am a lawyer practicing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.I work with a bequest firm. I am the personal attorney to late Mr. Hassan Q.Quruq,a citizen of republic of Sierra- Leone. He made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, XXX dollars, with a value of  XXX dollars, with BANK OF AFRICA. Upon maturity in February 2006 he  sent a reminder to my office once again, this time from the security company, but again we did nothing as the issue remains at the primary  level of the bank. After the expiration of this period the balance of the deposit will go to the custody of the security company , as the next of kin. Meanwhile, I will like to request for your partnership to assist in hiding this money and investments from the  public and government for several years to come. There are a lot of investments that could benefit from this opportunity. I have in my possession a pithy summary of the problem that currently exists within the country. These funds are presently with BANK OF AFRICA. The law enforcement agencies have the necessary legal authorities to conclude investigations and seize these funds. There is no escaping from this. Even when the funds become the property of the government. The bank policy stipulates accordingly. For your assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total funds, while 10% will be for any expenses that may be incurred by you during the process of this transaction. Can you understand my reasoning?  I have every legal document to back up your claim as the next of kin. ALL you are to do is to furnish me with your full names and address so that I can apply for a letter of authority proving you as the next of kin to the account.  From my standpoint, this transaction is 100% risk-free. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I look forward to hearing from you.

QUESTION: Hello my dear, I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a surprise. I am a citizen of the republic of cote d'ivoire and currently reside here in this city called abidjan, it is my intention to transfer some money from one account to another but first I would like you to be informed of my position before proceeding. I am an accountant with the Federal Ministry of Finance here in abidjan based in the European headquarters in London. I have a transaction which involves the transfer of a substantial sum of money to a friendly foreign account. This sum is US$15. Million United States Dollars only. I alone know of this account and the existence of this deposit with the Finance House in Abidjan. The sum in question is (US$15.M)  TWO HUNDREN FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) I alone know of its existence. The transaction has to be concluded before my government comes over to get the money because the President of our republic has declared war on our country. The finance house is situated in abidjan and the owner of the account is an ex-president of our republic Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo who is now in exile. The finance house has the power of the attorney over all deposits and priority. I have the power of attorney over all deposit documents including the Bank deposit, therefore I know the account owner is who he says he is and what he says. I need not tell you that this transaction is 100% risk free. What I need from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through.                                                                          .                         (2) YOUR ROLE: All I need from you is to stand as the account owner and forward your full contact and telephone numbers to enable us discuss the modalities and modalities of this transaction. We will discuss modalities on receiving your positive response. I expect you to keep this transaction very confidential for security reasons.                  (3) OUR ADVICE: We have been making constant efforts to get in touch with any of the relatives of the deceased. Unfortunately we have not managed to locate any of the family member for over two years now. We therefore propose we would like you to stand as the next of kin of the deceased, so that the proceeds of this deposit valued at (US$15.M) can be paid to you. This process could take up to ten years as we are limiting ourselves to this area of the world. If you are interested, please send your immediately your private telephone and fax numbers, address, phone and fax numbers, occupation and mobile number. Lastly we will discuss with you the modalities of this transaction, and the modalities you would accept.         (4) WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO:You will be asked to provide your name, address and telephone, and fax number. Then we shall discuss on details of your interest and the modalities of this transaction. All decision-making will be by consensus of the Board. I trust that our joint venture will be successful.

 FROM:MR.LARISA NITSKAYA BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. PHONE: 00226-7707-7885 EMAIL:larrynittaya@myway.com Dear, Thank you for giving me your time to write. I am Mr. Larisa Nitterka, the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso-West African. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that we shall be able to trust you with the information we have here in front of us. In 1990, when I became the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso, I discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5million dollars (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family while he was on a trip to Dubai in UAE in 2000.Sometime after the death of this customer, prior to his untimely demise, this account was audited and found out to be dormant and inactive for the past 3 years running. From my investigation, I also discovered that the owner of the account Mr. Warren Davidson died without a [heir] hence the money is left in the custody of the bank.According to the Burkina-Faso laws and regulations, if such money remains dormant or inactive for more than 3 years in the charge of our bank, the money will be transferred into the custody of the government department. In order to avert this, I got your contact through a reliable and a knowledgeable person who had the information needed to execute this transaction. I have made up my mind to seek for your assistance and cooperation to enable us conclude the transfer within 14 working days of the date of this letter. If you are willing to work with me, you are expected to indicate your interest to me by giving me your direct and private telephone number and fax number, which I will provide at the time of transaction. There is no risk involved in this matter, the information we need is a legal claim to the account, which a witness will produce at the time the funds are transferred. As soon as you confirm your ability to execute this transaction, we shall furnish you with the details. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. A favorable conclusion to this matter would be appreciated. Please send your reply to my confidential email address. Mr. Larisa Nitterka

He told me that he deposited this money in my bank as Africa World Fund (A.W.F.) or Asiatic World Fund (A.W.F.) as it was called then. He also told me that it was because of this that some of his close advisers deserted him during the crisis in Nigeria during the last time he was in office as president of Nigeria. Because of this, my husband was forced to step aside as president of the bank while the existing president is still interested in starting a new government, for he wanted to deploy some of this money (USD$14.5million) to fund his various private and political causes while he was president. Unfortunately, since 1999, my husband was not at liberty to visit our country due to my country's political instability, hence I cannot be sure of his safety. Moreover, he told me that he has plans to do this in his spare time. I am contacting you because I want you to know that I have a proposition for you. He told me that he intended to put up a consignment (constitutional instruments) in my bank as a security deposit for this money (USD$14.5million) and he also told me that it was his intention to buy arms from my bank to defend this money (USD$14.5million) from any rogue government officials. Such arms are now officially called "confiscates" and they will be kept securely in the "Confiscates" section of my bank vault as valuables.I have all the necessary legal documents that would be used to back up any claim we may make. All you have to do is to send me the name,country,occupation,gender and other required data in order to back up any claim we may make. This is simple. All you have to do is send me back the list of the "Confiscates" containing the money you wish to receive,so that we can work out the modalities of the money being claimed from our bank. I need not to remind you of the need for absolute confidentiality if this transaction involves your information. Please keep this transaction secret for security reasons. As I hear from you, please reply me through my private email address:shakibpatel@gmail.com and be rest assured that this transaction will be carried out under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, including civil service commission. Please also keep this transaction confidential. Yours truly, N.M.A.R.A (Shakib Patel).

Title: PLS ASSIST ME 
 PLS ASSIST ME  Dear Sir,     DEAR FRIEND,  I am Connor Josue,the only son of late Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Josue from Ivory Coast. I got your contact while i was doing a research on a trustworthy foreign partner in Europe who can assist me to invest the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million five hundred thousand United States dollars) with your assistance. As you can attest to, my father was a very wealthy and well-known businessman in my country of Liberia. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) with a security company in Europe.  His business associates, including my father, relied on this as the means of meeting up with him at his back door in Europe during those early weeks of August 1999. But on the 20th of sept 2000, the French military convoyed our house and arrested 40 of my father's associates. Some of my father's business associates including some of his top government functionaries including my father-elect were eventually smuggled out of Africa by French special forces. At this point my father-elect was in the process of being charged under the state of emergency that has been in force in Liberia since the death of my father, for allegedly financing the support groups that fight against the virile president of Liberia, who is also the president of west Africa, Mr. Charles Taylor. So my father-elect has been arbitrarily detained without trial. It is because of these circumstances that my father released my mother and I father's associates the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) from the security company in Europe. I need your assistance, as I am sure that with the help of you we can have our money's worth deposited in your account at a reputable security company in your country of choice. I don't want your help, as I must have the intention of using this money to establish an independent life, but your absolute equality to my father's associates assures me that I will get the results of this transaction without any problem. As for myself, I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free, because I will be working with my father's associates on this.  I need your fully confidential and honest assistance in securing the necessary legal permits and clearance needed for the movement of the funds.  With your fully confidential and honest assistance, we can have our life as a family in the west Africa. Please contact me urgently through my email address, to indicate your position on this project.  Please, keep this project as a top secret for now. May God be with you. Yours faithfully,                                            (FROM THE DESK OF: COLLINS BY MRS.  wellcomebel) ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: DEAR FRIEND
 DEAR FRIEND PARTNERSHIP REQUEST. I am the Manager of Accounts &amp; Auditing Dept of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso-West Africa. I am contacting you regarding your interest in the management of my branch. I am the Manager of Accounts &amp; Auditing Dept of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso-West Africa. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million United States Dollars (U.S. Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died with his entire family in October 2006 in a plane crash (Korean Air Line 801) which crashed into Lagos-Nigeria.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. However, we agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during this transaction and 50% would be for me. It is important to be honest to you because I wish to trust you unconditionally to keep this business proposition out of the bank treasury as well. I will provide the legal documents that will legitimise this transaction. I want you to observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this will be the last time we meet. Thanks for your co-operation and remain blessed. Yours faithfully, Mr. John Broder. READ FROM: JOHN H.BRODERICK. ¡Vive la trabajeada! http://www.trabajadodo.com

I serve on the Public Accounts Committee of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI) and on the Legal Services Committee of South Africa's Commercial Services Commission. We have an urgent and confidential business proposal for you. It involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. This sum of $8.5million United States Dollars is presently unclaimed and the owner of the consignment that contains this money has been declared dead having violated the Law of Namibia. This goes for example, The Commercial Services Commission of South Africa declared the sum of US $8.5million as floating in their treasury. On further investigation, we found out that the owner of this account was Mr. Fred yakubu Amendu and he was the sole beneficiary of this fund. Unfortunately, we now learn that his death was registered in Namibia and his bank account in London. We want to present you as the next of kin of this deceased and this is why I contacted you. I intend to use this money to transfer the rights to claim this money to your account. I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to claim this money from South Africa.

But now that we have got some information about his death, we are hoping that one day somepony will come forward and claim his money because we can't afford any more for security reasons and the government is already allotting out a lot of money to our security company for these same reasons. We are looking forward to a day when we can charge our customers with this money because we will no longer need this money. Please let me know if you are interested in this project so that I will provide you with the details that will enable you get started. Please be rest assured that this is very easy transaction that will bring us together because you will be getting a substantial return on your investment. You can contact me on my email address: [email protected] Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Faithfully, MRS. ANDREAS SCHRANNER ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id=4993

Title: FROM ANDREW GEDIK
 FROM ANDREW GEDIK FROM ANDREW GEDIK FROM ANDREW GEDIK CATTLE SAVINGS LTD. COTONOU,BOUAKE,LEBANON EMAIL ANDREW_GHEDIK@netscape.net Dear Friend, I am ANDREW GHEDIK a public servant in the office of General Secretary to the National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). According to the Composition of the NNPC as at thirtieth anniversary of its founding in 2001. The NNPC is a not for profit Corporation which many countries (especially Africa countries and regions) have been called upon to claim their resources/supplies which have been sitting in storage for a long time. It is my duty and responsibility to seek for a reliable and trustworthy person who might assist in this regard. I have considered the possibility that one of our client (my client) might be capable of handling the claim and there are certain details which I wish to emphasize. Firstly, let me explain the source of the information I wish to implicate in your help. My late client (my Uncle) was the Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He is survived by his Sister and only son. Before his death on January 4, 2006, he disclosed to me some very important information which I believe would be of immense benefit to our present situation. He told me that his boss used his position to take money from the company (Amount $10.5m) and deposited it with a Security Company in Europe. I also stated to him that the rightful owner of this money, who was neither amoung nor known to me, is presently with us. He advised that I should seek out any and all reliable people who might assist me in this regard. He further advised that it would be prudent to keep this money with us (the company) in the hope that it will be used in a profitable venture in the near future. He further informed me that the company does not know about this transaction and considers the transaction to be completely legal. I must further clarify that the position of our Client (my Uncle) was that of a foreigner, and as such he was not allowed to operate any account/accounts in the country where the alleged funds were registered.  As such he deposited the sum of ($10.5m) with a Security Company in Europe and advised me to seek out the assistance of a foreigner who could stand on as the real owner of the account of ($10.5m) which I shall introduce to you. I shall provide all necessary information and documents that will enable you claim this money from the Security Company. I shall also take care of any &amp; necessary deductions from the total amount as may be necessary. It is my sincere hope that you do not expose this transaction. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private email address: andrewgedike@netscape.net Please also, do not forget to delete this message immediately you receive this message. We wait to hear from you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. Yours faithfully, ANDREW GHEDIK (WILLIAMS JAMES).

EMAIL:m_dl_douglaiz@yahoo.com Dear, I am MRS MARIAMABEDU DOUGLAIZ, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BOA bank here in Ouagadougou in Burkina faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$12.5 million dollars (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in December,1999 in a plane crash.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site: http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/benin.crash/ http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/2000/Dated_December_1999.asp Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is necessary because we a being Burkinabé citizens of ouagadougou,and therefore face some restrictions on our ability to operate a bank account here in Burkina faso. I agree that 30% of this money will go to you as foreign partner while 60% will be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Thereafter, I will send to you information concerning this transaction, which I will provide for your perusal. Lastly, I will need your full co-operation to make this transaction a success. Please contact me as soon as possible on my email address: m_dl_douglaiz@yahoo.com. I look forward in your quick reply. __________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Title: PLEASE ASSIST ME

 PLEASE ASSIST ME Good day and a very happy new year,It may be sudden after the change of president Elect to office for him to be sworn in on 20th january 2018 but things are going on very slowly for now.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On a final inspection of the consignment held by my foreign partner in a Danish Police station here in Oslo, I discovered an abandoned consignment of a sum of $15.5million dollars(US$15.5million dollars) in an account that belongs to that of one of the top military/ intelligence(Two generals in charge of defense policy in this country) with total sum of US$15.5million dollars stashed in a *private, yet to be released to them since his passing in 2016. These people were in charge of supplying arms to the rebels in rebel country of Central America. My offer to assist you in repatriating this money and placing it in a capable legitimate account in your country should be granted to you on your acceptance of this business proposition. On my part, I have a list of 20 accounts in my office for deposit. I am the only person aware of this wealth in my office and of course I intend to share this wealth with my colleague.According to the Dutch laws on dormant account, if such amount remains unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the federal government treasury as unclaimed fund. My proposal is that, if you agree to assist me, I will let you know where the money is kept. If you agree to this, your role in the transaction would be to stand as the foreign contractor and claim this amount in your account. You will then come and claim this amount in your personal account in your country. I will be there to assist you in receiving the money after you have been claimed. I have all the documents to back-up this claim and I guarantee that this deal will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. I am contacting you because I want to present you as a reputable and trusted person to assist in this transaction. As soon as I hear from you, I will furnish you with the details and methods as well as the requirements for the transaction. I look forward to your reply through your private email address,and see you soon in your country. Please, treat this transaction as business as we will anticipate your assistance.

Title: Dear Sir
 Dear Sir Kindly accept my apology if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.Many thanks for your effort to read this message and I hope you do not take undue advantage of this opportunity. Please, do not be discouraged by my assurance of your complete confidentiality.I am James.K. Tomlinson an attorney to late Mr. John Hughes .I visit this site because I want you to know who I am and what I have done for you.On the 21st of May, 2000, my client,his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu, Lagos-Nigeria. Unfortunately, they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have lived in fear of being targeted by his enemies. After about 3 months, I contacted you with hope that you will prove to be the right person to help me claim this money from the Nigerian Government because I have already secured all the necessary legal documents that will present you/your company as the next of kin to the deceased. According to the Nigerian Law, after 5 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if I do not locate a willing beneficiary to inherit the fund. In a bid to stop me from inheriting this money, the Nigerian Government will demand that you prove your identity and place of residence before the transfer can be made.I will suitably compensate for your efforts and assistance before the transfer can be made. Please contact me as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, James.K. Tomlinson __________________________________________________________________ Tired of spam?

Title: (RE: (CONFIDENTIAL)))
 (RE: (CONFIDENTIAL))) I am Dr. Spencer Ngu a solicitor. I am representing Mr. Spencer Ngu a citizen of Sierra Leone. Here is the website http://www.change.org/syrieloge.asp and please just treat with the utmost confidentiality and confidentiality here. My name is Dr. Spencer Ngu from Sierra Leone and I represent Mr. Spencer Ngu a citizen of Sierra Leone. There is an account opened in this bank in 1986 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr. Spencer Ngu is not the right person to apply for this money because he has no family member who actually knows about this account and the account has no other beneficiary. Further investigation proved to me as well that Mr. Spencer Ngu was never in Sierra Leone or any country of Sierra Leone for that matter. According to the Sierra Leonean Law, under the regime of military dictator Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma no person shall operate or own more than five ATM machines in one locality. I am a lawyer and a member of a court in Sierra Leone and I was appointed to determine the eligibility of a foreigner to operate or own more than 5 ATM machines in one locality. The basic eligibility criteria to operate or own 5 ATM machines in one locality is that you have to sit at the same table with the Manager of the ATM Machine to be able to claim this fund. On the determination of your worthiness to claim this fund, the Manager will provide you with the details to apply for the transaction. There is no risk involved in the matter as the transaction is conducted under the law and regulations and all legal documents to prove the transaction will be provided. If you are interested, please reply only via email address. Upon your response, I will send to you by fax number or the email address you provide and the text of application. Your office day to day activities will be carefully monitored and abide by the strictest secrecy agreement possible. If you are interested, please reply only via email address. Upon your response, I will send to you by fax number or the email address you provide and the text of application.

My father was very wealthy and after his death she decided to give me and my mother a much needed financial boost. My mother is from Kariba in the Northern province of capital, Cote d'Ivoire and a retired socialite/and she has always been of a great help to me and my sisters. As such I am of immense help to you. Unfortunately, owing to the general situation of affairs with my country Liberia, President Charles Taylor has declared all of our money belonging to him as unclaimed. This means that if he is  in fact dead, there is nobody with the knowledge of this account to claim this money. This has seriously affected my future plans of having a go at starting up a business in your country. So I am soliciting for your assistance to assist in this regard. I have already secured with my name, in order to stop further contact. If you agree to act as the next of kin, you will be entitled to 10% of the money for your assistance, while the rest will be for me. Please contact me urgently on my confidential email address, so that we shall elaborate further. Should you be interested, you should also explain to me clearly, what your role will be in this project, and how you are to receive the money. I shall proceed immediately with further details on your reply. I look forward to your prompt response. Yours Faithfully, MRS. SINCERIA ANDREAS Lopez. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Title: Hello and Welcome
 Hello and Welcome Attn... My Name is Stacey Dane and I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank here in London. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £15million British Pounds - Fifteen Million British Pounds only. In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family  in December,2003 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner in this business is necessary because my client was a foreigner and an Indian cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner, hence I am soliciting for your assistance. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 70% will be for me ,and the remaining 10% would be for all expenses incurred during the business. Thereafter, I and other officials in my department will come over to claim the money from the bank but you shall not occupy a position of controlling the money. I will be there to assist you in receiving the money and handing it over to you as soon as you are ready to do so. Thereafter, we shall share the money as follows : 40% for you, 5% for me and my colleagues, while 5% shall be set aside for all expenses incurred during the business. Thereafter, I and other officials in my department will leave the bank for other financial and non-financial reasons. We expect your prompt response through email to enable usdiscuss further. Please, kindly contact me through email (staceydane89@yahoo.com) if you are interested in assisting us before we can conclude the transaction. This proposal shall be completed immediately. Please, be patient and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please contact me if you want to know the modalities on how we shall proceed with this transaction. Yours faithfully, Stacey Dane(Esq.) ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: The Proposal
 The Proposal Mr.Peter Daniel,Citizen of Canada and resident of Singapore, I am a citizen of Canada and a resident of Singapore. I have a very confidential and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2002, my client,his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several inquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended Relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet to locate any member of his family, hence this email. I contacted you to assist in retrieving some documents and evidence that belongs to my late client. The evidence we will need from you is a letter of authorisation from his Bank, which will authorise you to receive the money in your account as payment from his Bank. The money in question is SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). These funds are presently in a Security Company in Europe and it is my intention to use this money to relocate to your country. The money is presently floating in a Funds Management company in Europe.I have all the necessary legal documents to back up the claim we will make. If you are interested in assisting us commence the transfer of the funds, the acceptance rate at the time was 60% for you, while 30% was for me and my colleagues. At the conclusion of this transaction, I and my colleagues will each get 40% of the funds while the remaining 90% was for me.If this proposal is ok by you, you will instruct the transfer agent to release the funds to you. I hope to hear from you soon. My regards, Mr.Pete Daniel.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED URGENT REPLY MR.JOJORDO JON. AFRICAN WEBSITE: http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/story/2004/11/22/al-qa.html INTRODUCTION: I am Mr.jojordo jon, a Certified Public Accountant with the African Development Bank (ADB). I write to solicit for your assistance in a foreign direct deposit of (USD$12,500,000.00) twelve million united states dollars. This deposited sum was discovered and reported as having been abandoned by the owner of the said deposit, Mr. Osvaldo Derdele (a foreigner), since 1999. You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. SOURCE OF MONEY: The owner of the said account was Mr. Osvaldo Derdele an Italian by name, who was an investment and commodities merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. and his business partner were both citizens of the same country, so they too were not surprised when, in July 2000, Mr. Osvaldo Derdele died, leaving an account with the said bank with a closing balance of (USD$12,500,000.00) as at September 3, 2004 with all the account details and documents pertaining to the said deposit cancelled and all documents relating to the account expunged from the records. You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. On the 21st of July, 2004, while I was on business trip to Dubai with my partner, we discovered an abandoned trunk box in an ungodly heat, the box was closed and locked, and no one was around to open the box, and we proceeded to call for help, and found ourselves in search for someone to stand as our next of kin, because the ADB does not allow such things to remain more than 5 years, in other words we will be probed for the next of kin as at now nobody is coming for the claim of the trunk box. We will charge you 30% of the total sum for your assistance/assistance, 60% shall be for me ,and 10% would be for any expenses/expenses that may be incurred during the process of the transaction. Please if you are interested get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks for your consideration. Yours faithfully, MR JOJOR DERDELE _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

EQ DOMINANT EMBARRASSMENT SINCE THE FORMATION OF STATE ALLIANCE FOR THE BURKINA FASO, I HAVE BEEN ADVISING BUSINESS CONTRACTORS AND INFLATED CONTRACTS DURING MY EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. I PASSED THE TEST OF THE CONTRACTORS WITH THE FOREIGNERS AND MANDATED THEM TO CARRY OUT A CAREFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF CONTRACTS THAT WERE IN THE PICTURE. DURING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCESS, I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS AND THIRTY-FIVE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS STILL IN PICTURE DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION WHICH WAS DISCOVERED BY US. THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) FIVE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS ONLY, AND TELEPHONE BILLS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN BURKINA FASO. THE SUM OF US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS IS A TREASURE AND IT IS NOW USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ACCORDING WITH THE YEARS OF THE DEPOSIT FOR TREATMENT. IT IS PRESENTLY BURKINA FASO AND THE FUNDS ARE WITH THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. HOWEVER, THE FUNDS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE BECAUSE THE YEARS OF THE DEPOSIT HAS RUN OUT AND THE FUNDS ARE NOW BEING LOOKED FOR IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE ABOVE ARRANGMENT IN THE WEBSITE DISCOVERED BY US PROVED THAT THE FUNDS SHOULD BE REMITTED INTO A NON-TRANSFERABLE ACCOUNT DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE DEPOSIT. THE REASON HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING REMITTED INTO NON-TRANSFERABLE ACCOUNT INCLUDES THE TIME OF EXECUTION OF THE CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH A CLAIM HAS BEEN MADE ON A CONTROLLED FUND, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED TO A NEW ACCOUNT DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE CONTROLLED FUND AND THE MANAGER OF THE BANK. THE REQUEST OF A FOREIGN PARTNER IN THIS TRANSACTION IS OCCASIONED AND WE REQUEST YOUR WEBSITE TO DISCUSS ALL MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. MUST THE TRANSFER BE MADE? AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE ABOVE AMOUNT HAS BEEN NET WIDE TOTALLY US$30.5 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS, AND THE NET VALUE HAS BEEN US$20.5 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS. AS IT MAY INTEREST,I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRANSFERING THIS MONEY TO SOME OTHER PERSONAL ACCOUNT DUE TO THE LARGER CONTENT OF THIS MONEY AND THE RISK OF OUR BANK NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE FUND OUT OF BURKINA FASO UNTIL THE TIME OF TRANSFER. HOWEVER,I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN BURKINA FASO AND AUDITING THE WHOLE SITUATION TO MAKE SURE THE PLACE IS CLEAR BEFORE THE TIME OF TRANSFER. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR NAME, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOUR URGENT RESPONSE. WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU THE LATEST NELSON INFORMATION AS IT MAY BE, BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. It is the law and policy here that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money shall be for you as foreigner partner, in respect to the provision of a non-resident account, 10% shall be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 70% would be for me. Thereafter, I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above and so the sum to be transfered will be as follows: 60% for me, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses incured during the business. Please, you should keep this business proposal very confidential and relevant to your business because of theforeigner in the company,you should not disclose the nature of the transaction to anyone.

Since then, no one knows about this transaction or anything concerning it, as no one has operated on this asides to claim the consignment containing this huge sum of money, which was paid to him as a wedding gift. Before my late client was killed, he moved out this money in cash to a private security company in Europe. And from there it is going into the custody of a security company in Europe. And from there it will be deposited with a private security company. And finally, after six months, the money will be reclaimed from the custody of the security company. I am only contacting you, the lawyer, because I want you to stand as a beneficiary to this money and have your identity revealed to the security company so that the proceeds of this money can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you. There is no risk involved, the amount involved is (US$15.5M)Twenty five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will provide you with the details. Please be informed that the business is 100% risk free.

Title: INVESTMENT PROPOSAL.
 INVESTMENT PROPOSAL. FROM:Dr. James Alexander. Tutor, Financial Transformation and Institutions of Last Resort. 186 Corporation Street, Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria. Attn: The President. Dear Sir, RE: TRANSFER OF ($10.4MILLION) FOUR MILLION US DOLLARS. I know this letter may come to you as a surprise, but please bear with me and we will go over a very sensible business. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2004, an Iraqi private contractor with the US firm, hired by my firm, made a numbered time (Fixed) contract valued at ($10.4MILLION) US DOLLARS with our Company here in Lagos-Nigeria. According to our documentation, this contract was satisfactorily executed and date stamped. All the contractors that was supposed to make delivery were actually scheduled to receive their paychecks on the 21st of June, 2004. Upon the receipt of the paychecks though, the contractors started to send no funds to the company. The company started to dredge the docks in order to keep the contract documents and documentation valid, but they eventually stopped due to lack of labor force. A closer look at the web site of the main contractor, (http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/12/13/kenya.crash/index.html), and you will see that the site has been completely destroyed by the Nigerian Navy. The government has also begun to investigate on charges that the company did not declare the profits on many contracts it executed in the country. Though it may seem strange to you of whom you know the situation in the world, but when a government official makes a contract with you, it usually means something is amiss. This is why it is essential to have a trusted and reliable person in this transaction, because then the government official can usually be made the beneficiary. For your assistance, I have agreed to pay 30% of the total sum to you, while 10% will be set aside for all the expenses we may incurred during the process of this transaction. You are entitled to 10% of the sum if you agree to perform this service for me. I shall require your full name, address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication, while giving a few details to give you an idea of what the transaction entails. I will expect your reply to this letter so as to friend me enough to allow me hire your company to collect some time in your company. I expect your response to this letter please, I look forward to your response. Yours Sincerely, Dr.James Alexander. _________________________________________________________________ Don�t just search. Find. Check out the new MSN Search!  http://search.msn.com

I write in respect of a foreign customer of my firm and I want you to assist in this deal. While I was on the process of negotiations with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, a Foreign Gas supplier from Hungary came to my firm as he had a contract with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. And he made a fixed deposit for 21 calendar months, with firm code name 50/50 with the company. And on the 20th day of May, 2000, the supplier's tank was empty and his next of kin were notified aswell. Consequently, my client was directed to send the sum of $15.250,000 US Dollars to the bank as next of kin to the deceased. And he did and he sent it  along with his identification. And the bank accountant was also informed and directed to collect the money and put it in a safe account for our mutual benefit. And my bill is as follows: 15,250,000USD (You shall read more about the supply and supply contracts and contracts on behalf of the government of Nigeria by clicking on this website. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=28351006 http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/06/alaska.airlines.html http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=28351006 http://www.compuserve.com/c/newsletter?tmpl=newsletter&amp;u=/ap/20050630/ap_iphone_friendly.asp and so on and so forth.

And for some reason the application was not hear by the Federal Government of Nigeria. And the Federal Government of Nigeria does not officially know the existence of the contract with the suppliers to the company. And the company is afraid to make the suppliers to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation liable for money they have not proven to them. Accordingly, the Federal Government is threatening to audit the company and stop the supply to them. And the Federal Government of Nigeria is also planning to seize the company's assets here in  Nigeria. And if they hear from you, they will confiscate all their assets here in Nigeria and put them up for auction to the highest bidder.

On further investigation and investigation, it was decided by the Government of Malaysia Airports that the passengers were Bounties to play the sum of $12.5M (Twelve Million United States Dollars) in a lottery system, on 15th April 2002, the ticket operator declared the ticket as sold out. Also, it was agreed by the Government of Malaysia Airports that, after the government officially debarred the ticket, I and two other lawyers will be legally permitted to prosecute the ticket on behalf of my client. It was also agreed that, at the conclusion of this business, the ticket would be transferred to any Foreign Bank account we will provide. As You may remember, prior to my legal opinion of the ticket being declared unsold, my client requested that the ticket be played without a ticket. It was actually my turn to provide the legal opinion. I immediately received a phone call from our secured phone, informing me that my client asked for a ticket and that I should present my client to the Foreign Bank as the next of kin to the deceased. At that point, my client was dead, and nothing had happened. My client was in the hospital bed with his head in a tube, and the only person that knew of his existence was my client and his accountant. All documents proving his existence was administered by my client, and the certificate of deposit of the account was with a bank in Europe. The bank has since ascertained that my client died without a body. For now, we need a foreign partner that can provide an account to us, as there are no record of his activities or existence.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED FROM MAMA CALVIN KAYANE BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPT. OPPORTUNITY RED HILL,  LAGOS-NIGERIA. PORTFOLIO OF THE NIGERIAN WELFARE AND RELATIONS. AUSTRALIA. Dear Sir/Madam,  I am  MAMA  KAYANE, THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPT. IN THE NIGERIA WELFARE CENTRE. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRANSFERING THE LEFT OVER SUM OF US$23.MILLION (TWENTY- EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ). THIS MONEY WAS DISGUISED AND SHIPPED TO ONE OF THE EUROPEIAN COUNTRY BY THE TIME WE ARRANGED TO BRING THIS FUND. HOWEVER DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE THE FUND HAS BEEN INCREASED IN SALES DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND REVIEWING OF APPLICATIONS, WE SAW THE AMOUNT OF TOKENS CONSIGNED AND SENT OUT TO SEIZE THE PROGRESS. WE ARE STILL ASSURING THE COMPLETE COMPLEMENT OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRACE OF THE CONTRACT. WHEN THE BUSINESS IS COMPLETED AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE LEFT OVER SUM WILL BE REMITTED TO THE LEFT OVER BANK. CONSIDERING THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF TRANSFER OF THIS ACCURACY, WE SAW THE RISK OF OVERSEASING OF THE MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THIS LOT OF US,BECAUSE THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS THIRTY TWO MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. WE SAW THE IMMUNITY OF THE BUSINESS WITH THE BANK AND DID NOT SUSPEND THE APPLICATION, SINCE WE REACHED BANKED UNDER OUR CONTROL. IT IS FROM OUR REASON THAT I AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN MY  DEPARTMENT ARE NOW SEEKING FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION TO CARRY OUT THE PROCESS OF THE TRUNK LOT AND INVEST $15.5 MILLION (FIFTY M (FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS )) DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER. IT WILL BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IN NIGERIA DUE TO THE RISK MODE OF THIS BUSINESS. CONCLUSIVELY, IT IS OUR PLEASURE TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE TOTAL SUM, WHICH I COULD SINCERELY EXPECT FROM YOU DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER DUE TO SAFE KEEPING THE ACCOUNTS IN US TO A SAFE LEVEL OF 3,500 (USD) PER DAY, DURING THE COURSE OF THE BUSINESS. THIS KINDLY INDICATES YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US AND ALSO WE CONCLUDE THE DETAILS OF THE TRANSFER. YOU CAN READ MORE OF SABASTIAN'S OVERSEAS APPLICATIONS AT: http://www.safaspace.com

Title: ASSISTANCE
 ASSISTANCE Dear Sir/Madam I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. I am a citizen of  Iraq by name Abdul Kadib.I work in the Iraqi private and federal  contract industry here in Baghdad.Before the onset of the war in Iraq I was  Plenipotentiary to the then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.And before his  last breaths he ordered all my colleagues to leave the country as soon as possible.I  and i carried out an analysis and discovered an abandoned sum of $20.5million dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only)in an account that belongs to one of  our foreign contractors who died with his entire family in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 253. My  analysis proved to me that he died without making a WILL,and all our official documents relating to his death are  still with us.And since then i have made several inquiries with the Federal Government of Iraq to come forward and claim this money, but  sadly we are told that he is dead as well. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this business proposal to you and to get your cooperation so that we can  transfer this money into your private banking account. We have all the documents that will empower you as the original- beneficiary to claim this money. We have decided to compensate you with 10%of the total amount for your collaboration. Please get in touch with me as soon as possible so that we can go over this business deal and find a solution that will be mutual. Please do not  forget to  include your telephone,fax and mobile telephone numbers if you can help. Thanks in anticipation for your urgent cooperation.

 ATTN:MD DR THE MANAGER, PLEASE READ AND RESPOND Dear, I greet you in the name of God Almighty and my prayers are with you as we await your positive response. My name is Dr. James Cook from Saumur, Ghana, a Protestant minister by profession and a member of the church since 1853 until his death on 31st October 2006. Before his death on 31st October 2006, he was Bishop of Lagos in position of Bishop, and having held the office of Bishop since 1973, he was married to three wives, namely: Nancy, Margaret and Louisa. Their first husband was General Francis Cook who served in the Government under the leadership of the late president of Ghana, General Sani Abacha. In the early of the year of our Lord (2005), my wife Margaret and I moved to Dakar-Senegal with our three children in the intention of travelling to Europe or any other country of which we are informed by the ministry of the church we are now leaving with. We decided to change our names and so that we could better stand out as an identity group from the defectors from the church. We soon discovered that the Trans-Atlantic Airlines (T.A.B) flight that we had been intending to use to travel to any country we will be chartering, was cancelled due to lack of passengers. My son-in-law and I, now act as the guardians of this trust, made up our minds to change our names so that we could travel to any country we will be chartering as the new identity group so we could better stand out as an identity group from the defectors. We decided to change our names to: James, James and James Cooks meaning that we want to secure this new position of trust in your company for our future investments and also for the sake of our children's future. We will offer you 20% of the proceeds of this transaction for your assistance. We have decided to use this new opportunity to ask for your assistance in the matters we intend to do for you. We are prepared to compensate you with a percentage of your salary as compensation for any inconvenience that may occur during the process of this transaction.

Title: GOOD DAYS
 GOOD DAYS Dear Sir, I am Prof.Neil Diamond, the Auditor General of Alhaji Bank of Al-Hijaz,A suburb of Al-Hijaz, in the province of Diyala. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $US15 million dollar (Fifteen million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 31st October,2003 in a plane crash in Cotonou - Benin. You shall read more stories about the crash on visiting this site:(http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/10/26/benin.crash) and (http://www.wral.com/news/16320517/detail.html). Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his Only Son and Daughter) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this situation behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a resident of Benin Republic of Benin and a local farmer, while the customer was also a resident of Benin Republic of Benin. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was also unemployed and retired from the service of the Bank. I agree that 30% of this money shall be for you as foreign partner, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses incurred during the business. I will seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this transaction can be paid to you, while the remaining 70% shall be for me. You should note that a fixed deposit is a security mechanism under which the fund is lodged and it is only the account owner who can authorize the movements of the money. I will provide the instructions to enable you obtain the money in your account as arranged.Should you be interested,please reply urgently so that I will send you the detailed instructions.Thanks for your co-operation and I shall give you the detailed instructions as soon as I receive your response. Yours faithfully, Dr.Neil Diamond ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Title: Please Contact me
 Please Contact me Dear, Sir, I am Your loyal and humble servant in this my condition. I am alhaji bintus the only son of late Colonel Edwards bintus the former senior military adviser to the president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, late president Goodluck Jonathan.It may be strange to you of what my situation is really like. I am currently residing with my father in Zaire and have just been recently granted political asylum by the Federal Government of Zaire. In the year 2000, the head of state, president Jonathan had to abdicate office because of charges of Cash Fraud. He was accused of secretly owning $35m US Dollars(Thirty million united states dollars) as cash. It was alleged that during his term as president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, he deposited some amount of money with a security company in Europe. This amount was determined to be somewhere between $15.3m US Dollars and $35m US Dollars. I am only 22years old and really don't know what to do or how to get out from here.  I don't want to go back to Africa where therefore I wants to go to Europe to seek political asylum. My father told me that before he died he was able to move out some amount of money with a security company in Europe which is still in the custody of the Finance House, that amounts to about $1.3million US Dollars. I am only 22years old. I got your contact address from a directory on the internet, after a little research I decided to contact you for assistance in securing a valid form of international travel document to enable us move this money out of Africa to your country. You will be allowed to keep 20% of the money for yourself and the rest for me. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up claims we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I look forward to your soon reply via mail. Yours in standing,                                               BOUAKE, SOUTH AFRICA. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Search!

I work with a finance company here in Abidjan and we are looking for a representative to handle a transaction of $10.5M (Ten million five hundred thousand united states dollar) that has been dormant and is now ready to be transferred to our company. This money belongs to Mr. and Mrs. George W. Bush who died in Dec. 2001. Before they died, George W. Bush and his wife Barbara were both active in the world of business and owned numerous companies. It is believed that George W. Bush deposited some amount of money with a security and trust company in Europe and this amount was (US$10.5M)  $10.5 million united states dollars. Now that the president is dead, nobody knows about the content of the deposit because he hasit all out in confidence with the company. Unfortunately, my client and his wife was both among the dead. It is on this basis that I seek your partnership in this business to deal with the security company and the highest bidder. My proposed transaction is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. and Mrs. George W. Bush and receive the money from the security company and distribute it among the charity organizations in the world and the world at large. There are a lot of such organizations already operating in the world. Additionally, you will be required to help me distribute the money in your country and also take care of any necessary taxes as appropriate. All I require is your honest co-operation and urgent intrest. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Please contact me immediately by mail if you are interested to enable me start this transaction with you immediately. If you are not interested, I will require the need for a foreign account where the funds will be remitted. Please, contact me immediately on my email address or my phone number +44 (0) 79 277 6088 while you are in the process of considering this proposal. Yours Faithfully, Barr, Barrister, Amarr Albahi.

PROPOSAL I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On May 31, 2004, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Government of Nigeria, Mr. Richard Childress made a numbered time (Fixed contract) offer to  me for the transfer of $4.5 Million US Dollars. I declined his request due to the serious nature of the matter at hand. But after going through some old files in the  archives, I discovered that the Nigerian government has a hold on some of the funds and the owner of this contract was Mr. Richard Childress. It will be your turn to review the funds then I will approve or deny the contract to you on behalf of the government. The need for a foreigner as the beneficiary of this contract is occasioned by the fact that the contributor is a foreigner and not an in person, information which is needed to claim this money. I am David Gilbert, the Attorney to Late Mr. Richard Childress an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Government of  Nigeria. He made this contract with me to receive and handle various types of contracts and he specifically mentioned that Shoe was one of the types of contract he wished to receive and handle. He also specified that it should be executed in the US dollars. In order to avoid any further complacence from the government, I hereby advise that you should seek foreign partner to handle this contract for us. This is simple, we will need your full name and address to enable us initaly collect the contract and then you will come over and take delivery of the funds when the contract is contractually executed. We have both signed a non disclose agreement on the part of you that when the contract is successfully executed, both of us will share in the sum of $4.5 Million US Dollars. We have both performed a thorough background check and found out that you are currently residing in USA, so we are going to need your full name and address so we can use in the immigration authorities. On behalf of the company, I will demand for your identification, your International Drivers License or Passport details and your full name and address as well. I will then make a flyer for you to identify yourself to the authorities as the sole beneficiary and also lodge a declaration that you are the only surviving son of late Mr. Richard Childress. A quick internet search on your name, address, and International Drivers License/Passport in both English and in Arabic revealed that your relation is genuine and not a forged copy. The company will need your full name and address to enable us send you letters of application and finally to obtain the required documents securing the funds in your account in the company. I have proof that you have the required information to accept this deal. All you need to do is to mail the company your complete name, full address, International Drivers License/Passport and your full name, address and International Drivers License/Passport to enable us forward your information to the attorney to claim the funds and send it to you as the only surviving son of late Mr. Richard Childress. You can find the full legal documents used by the company at this site: http://www.fasonhead.com/regulations/reg_8709.asp?R=8 http://www.fasonhead.com/reg_8709.asp?R=8 On the recommendation of the attorney, the board of directors of the company will meet on Monday, June 11, 2004 to approve and direct the attorney to claim the funds and send it to you. Both board members will be present at the meeting to sign the deal. I will be there to argue for a proper share for you. If you are interested, send the following informations in a timely manner: - Your full name and address - Your International Drivers License/Passport - Your company's name and address. I guarantee that this deal is 100% risk free. If you are interested, send back to me your Banking and/or Commercial Attorney details of your Commercial or Banking License/Passport to enable us claim them together with their corresponding information to enable us claim them together with our respective share of the funds. The attorney will need from you the following informations: - Your full name and Address - Your International Drivers License/Passport - Your company's name and address.

Title: PROPOSAL
 PROPOSAL Dear Friend I am Mr. KONE,the Auditor General of  the German Federal Ministry of Finance. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million US Dollars(USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 25% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 75% will be for me and my colleagues while 5% will be set aside for all the expenses we incurred during the transaction.My role in this transaction is that I will stand as beneficiary and manager of this fund while the rest will be for me and my colleagues.The transaction has to be concluded before the end of the year 2000, when the new president of the republic of Ghana, General Sanogo Dos Santos takes office, I will be working with my colleagues to transfer this money to any country of your choice, where the money will be safe and we can fully operationalize this fund. As soon as this money gets to your country, you are expected to apply to the bank as next of kin to the deceased for the transferal of the fund, as indicated in our banking guidelines. As soon as you receive this letter, kindly send me your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. If you are interested, contact me through my private email address or my office phone and fax number. Thanking for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to you.

My name is Mr.B.O.S, I work with a bank here in Ghana and one of our accounts with holding balance of $10 million has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 3 years. &gt;From the date of establishment of this account in 2000, the owner of the said account Mr. A.S.Wu, a foreigner, an accountant with the Korean Ministry of Commerce and Trade, has been staying in the country with his family since 1995. His late wife died in the plane crash of Korean Air Line 405 with their three children on the 31st of March 2002.After the death of his late wife and son, Mr. A.S.Wu made up his mind to move the funds to a hidden account outside the country because he is afraid that whoever will claim this money will try and execute this order, which he wrote down in his log book, on depositing of the funds, on his going through a mailing list forsuggested sources of funds.After his death, no one has come forward to claim this money because he has no next of kin,and the bank cannot launch legal proceedings against him because he is a foreigner. He also wrote down the sum $10.5 million in our account as unused fund in his log book. Even if I do not claim this money from his side, the bank will continue to service our account because we are civil/political/civil servants.I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.I also want to keep this money in a safe abroad, for the safety of my career. I need a reliable person in this business because I need a trusted and well-informed person in this business. If you are interested in this business, you send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Upon your response,you will be given the opportunity to negotiate your mode of share. I must also inform you that 40% of the money will go to your nominated bank in any bank of your choice where the rest of the money will be kept until we sign a binding agreement on your behalf.I will be waiting for your response .

On further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. John was a Foreign contractor to the Nigerian Ministry  of petroleum Resources and a paid interpreter for the Brazilian President of the Federal  Republic of Nigeria, Mr. Lula da Silva. At the time of his death, Mr. John was living in Lagos and making plans to move to Lagos to take residence in the United  States of America. His employer, the Brazilian Petroleum and Chemical Service, does not know about this account or any part of it and has  the account closed down and the record of the account is sealed. This sum of US$22.5 million can not be claimed by my government because I am still in office as the Minister, I am the only one who knows about this account and i will demand that all the account documents be re-opened for transfer of the money to another government account or to  any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. The sum of US$22.5 million is cashed and the sum of US$9 Million is still floating in a Security Company in Europe.   I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the government is now 100% sure that I am the person who  did this,they have concluded  legal proceedings against me,among other things they wish to do.   Your fee will be used to build a relationship with my government which is needed in the near future. I thank you in advance and shall let you know how much I appreciate your assistance.

Title: RULE OF THE TRADE
 RULE OF THE TRADE Dear Sir/Madam, I am a lawyer practicing in Lagos, Nigeria. I work with a very respected firm. One of our clients was an African princess who wished to migrate to your country. Unfortunately, her step-father was the former president of the Federal Government of Nigeria. During his time as president of Nigeria, he had an estimated net worth of $36 million dollars. Unfortunately, for his family, he died in a coup led by his bodyguard on November 4, 1999. Since then they have been facing lot of political problems in the country.One of these problems was that,late President Olusegun Obasanjo Jr. who is still in office died on the same day that he was supposed to give a speech about the need for a democratic government in Nigeria.You can verify this fact from the public domain. You can check it on this website which was published by CNN.com. Below is a copy of the text of the speech that he gave at a meeting of the Organization of Western African States in Abuja, Nigeria. OBASANJO: "THE NIGERIAN PEOPLE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME OF ITNFORMATION AS IT MAY BE. NIGERIAN POLITICAL ASYLUM CAMP IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE SOONEST PROBLEM OF THE ABANDONED TREASURES. THE NEXT OF KIN HAS BEEN ABANDONED AND THE FUNDS ARE NOW IN THE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT OF THE UNITED NATION CERTIFICATE OF DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE. HOWEVER, THE SUM OF-US$36 M (THIRTY-FOUR MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) IS NOW IN THE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT OF UNITED NATION CERTIFICATE OF DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE. HOWEVER, THE COMMITTEE HAS COMMITTED WITH THE BANK AND THE LAWYER OF THE BANK TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE FUNDS TO BE REMITTED INTO THE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT AS EARNED. THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANY ACTION FROM YOU AS SOON AS THE FUNDS ARE IN THE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT. YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY ADVICE THE BANK AND LAWYER TO KEEP THE MONEY IN THE MUTUALLY AFFORDED ACCOUNT DUE TO THE SITUATION OF THE FOREIGN PARTNER WHO IS BEHINDING THE BUSINESS AND THE DESIRE OF INVESTING THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.I WOULD REQUIRE A REPLY THROUGH OUR INBOX AT THIS EMAIL ADDRESS:sessaimos@yahoo.com.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED Dr. kaczynski &amp; Associates. The Attorney at Law. 17 Goswin, Suite 108, Langham Road, Singapore. Email: kczy01@ansinternet.com Phone: +66-70-45-755852 Email: kczy01@insites.com ATTN: MD/CEO Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Dr. kaczynski &amp;Associates. I represent a high profile individual/company that has a bizony transaction that requires your firm services as an Attorney/Ceo.I need your urgent and confidential response. The above quoted sum is (US$13 Million Dollars Only) I am the Attorney at Law and the accountant of a BANK HERE IN SINGAPORE. There is this amount that came about as a result of a transaction that occurred a while ago. On August 22nd 2002, Mr. JOHN KOROVO, an Oil merchant/contractor with the Russian Railways/The China National Petroleum Corporation made a contract with the Government of Singapore to supply the Russian America Oil Merchant with Oil services in Shanghai. On the 19th of August 2002, Mr. John KOROVO made a numbered time (Fixed) contract with the Russian Railways/The China National Petroleum Corporation to supply the oil merchant in Shanghai and this contract was for 12 months only. About a week before the Russian oil merchant left for China, he made a numbered time (Fixed) contract with the Chinese Oil Merchant and this contract was extended to 31 days and finally expires (Unlocked) when Mr. John KOROVO returns from China. While I was working with the Russian Railways/The China National Petroleum Corporation, I discovered an abandoned sum of $13 Million Dollars (USD$13M) in a Floating Deposit account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in Plane Crash of NTSCA Flight 931, which crashed into the Hudson River, Canada abidjan the 20th of May 2002. You can view the website as we have discussed before, but in summary, The Russian plan was to  Re-provision the funds to American contractor who by this time will have been paid and then they will resell the money to any foreigner that is willing to pay for the same. The problem is that the said money has been successfully stored with a Finance and Accounting Company in Europe. The reason why nobody has come forward to claim the funds of the late Russian Railman/contractor is because he has an extension of 60 days on his contract and that will expire on the 31st May 2002. And the original contract payer is the American contractor. I alone know of this situation and the reason why the funds are successfully stored with the Finance and Accounting Company in Europe. The contract was supposed to be paid off when the contract was awarded, but due to some political situation in my country, the Commission President and the President of Federal Agency of Singapore signed an agreement on applications. So, the money is here with the Finance and Accounting Company in Europe and nobody will ever come forward to claim it. It will expire after six years and nobody will be able to come forward to claim it again. I will start by searching the world for a reliable and honest foreigner that can stand as the next of kin to the late Russian Railman/contractor. The Commission will remit the funds to you immediately upon your acceptance of your services for the transaction. As soon as the funds get to you, we shall furnish you with the details and the application form as well as the documentations of the contract you will be required for the claim of the funds. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. May God bless you and give you incredible dreams in your life. Please contact me immediately you receive this letter through my email: kczy01@ansinternet.com  Yours faithfully, Dr. kaczynski &amp;Associates. ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

EMAIL.jordan_rack@web.de PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir, I am Mr.Jordan Rleman, the Auditor General of BOA AFRICA (BOA). I wish to obtain your consent to present you as next of kin to my late client Mr. Pervez Khadafy, a national of your country and a resident of London, England. Mr. Khadafy was an Iraqi Foreign lecturer at Birmingham University and also a material producer in the céce market. He was assassinated on January 2nd 2003 by two suicide bombers as he was about to give a speech concerning the need for international cooperation in dealing with Iraq. For more details about the event and the assassination, you can log on to, http://www.crocnews.com/story/2003/1/13/51213.html Since then, nobody has come to claim the money or claim the house as the next of kin of Mr. Khadafy, which means that the liberal international community cannot legally transfer the money and property left behind by my client before the commencement of war, which is why I am contacting you for a solution. I have considered the fact that my client was a liberal individual and if I do not claim this money it will be confiscated and declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Also, the corporate structure of the bank where this deposit were lodged does not allow such deposits to be lodged more than four times in a calendar year. In order to avert this situation, I propose a temporary suspension of the account and the transfer of the funds and property left behind by my client before commencement of war. I will expect your response by sending to me your private phone &amp; Fax number, where you can be reached in the event of non-availability.

From:                                                  (FROM THE DESK OF:ADDRESS ATTRIBUTES) ATTN: MD/CEO, I am DR, ABDULAYE BARAH, I work for a reputable bank here in Ghana and we are in the business of foreign payment services. My colleagues and I have identified some of the largest payment processing companies in the world and are willing to negotiate for your perusal, as we have a proposal for you to consider. In 1996, the Federal Government of Ghana signed the Payment of Federal Grants (Payments to foreign contractors) Agreement with the Paying Contractors which obligates all foreign contractors to pay into the Federal Government for a fixed period of 4 years. This company was awarded the contract by the Federal Government and all foreign contractors to be paid into the Federal Government. Now, more than 10 years later, the contract was still pending when the present Federal Government was in power. And, as there was no points of reference for the contract, there was nothing to stop the contract from being awarded to any contractor with the right information concerning the contract, as all further references would have to be made to the Federal Government. In fact, the Contracting and Implementation Manual of the Federal Government of Ghana stipulates that if any contracting party does not declare the existence of the contract, the contract will be declared void and the money paid into the Federal Government treasury as unclaimed bill. And, as the present Federal Government is not in favour of paying unclaimed contracts to foreign contractors, they have officially declared that the contract has been officially terminated. Consequently, the Federal Government has officially notified my colleagues in the company that we are out of money and that we will have to look for a new contractor to carry out the work we have contracted out. And, we do not want the contract to go into the Federal Government treasury as unclaimed fund. We want the money to be paid into a Federal Government account since the contract was awarded to us. The Federal Government cannot legally fund the payment of unclaimed contracts to foreign contractors. The bottom line is that our proposals is that we will pay you 25% of the unclaimed funds, and 75% to us. The amount you are willing to negotiate for us is equally important. You have the option of negotiating a percentage for your part, or you can seek our counsel and ask us for your intellectual help and help to carry out our plans. We look forward to hearing from you soon.    Yours faithfully,  DR ABDULAYE BARAH.  __________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

Title: From Mrs. kim how are you?
 From Mrs. kim how are you? Dear Sir, I am Mrs. kim 1958 a widow to late Mr. Morris Reed who was murdered in the conflicts of sierra Leone and Liberia. I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person, therefore I will like to introduce myself to you.

On August 25, 2003, Mr.began his second tour of duty in Liberia when he came under fire from the Liberian National Resistance Committee. As he approached the end of his second tour, he was killed in a battle. After his death, I became ill and spent most of my time in the hospital. After about two months, my husband died along with about 30 other members of the UNMISS ICTC. Since then I have been put under house arrest by the Liberia government. My situation in the country is not good, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the authorities of the government of Liberia. My late husband was a very wealthy businessman and he has over US$25.5Million (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) deposited with a security company in the names of my three sons. The government of Liberia does not know about this and I don't want them to know about this, I want them to know that my husband was a patriot and I want them to be thankful that I am alive now. I want my children to know that I love them and that I am not afraid to say what I believe in. I want them to know that I am capable of doing what is necessary and right.

From: KEVIN ABDULLA
Title: 
 FROM (KEVIN ABDULLA) BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO. Dear friend, I am Mr. Evan Abbadala, senior accountant with the bank of a francais. I write in respect of a foreign customer of our bank. My name is Mr. Evan Abbadala, senior accountant with the bank of a francais. I was a private contractor with the federal government of Nigeria, during the period 1999 to date. I was falsely accused of involvement in the murder of one of our president's secretaries in the month of April,2002. He was ironically murdered by three members of his inner circle.For more information regarding the incident please see this website: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1313 I have since been placed under formal investigation by the Nigeria National Petroleum Security Company. Their evidence against me is based on a file that I diverted to them. I do not know if the allegations in this case are true or not, but I know that they are baseless and have no factual basis. Their investigation uncovered no proof supporting the accusation, and my client is innocent. As a matter of fact, I have worked with him personally on several projects involving sum of $4.5million dollars. They involved the construction of several pipelines in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. On the 26th of April 2002, my client, Mr. Yusuf Laidlaw, made an application for payments to the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources here in  Lagos-Nigeria. He claimed his services as his partner were due to end on April 25, the 19th.2003, and with the outcome of this application, his rights as a partner was lost.By virtue of his position with the government of Nigeria, the former Minister of Petroleum Resources could not get a visa to come to America. Since then, I have made numerous attempts to obtain political asylum in Europe and Asia. I have also attempted to get political asylum in Canada. Finally, Canada has virtually no asylum system, and if I do not apply for political asylum, I will be extradited to Nigeria for further investigation. I have been confined only to our country home by my husband, and all my correspondence is monitored.If I do not apply for political asylum, I fear that my husband and I may be tried and jailed in Canada. Furthermore, we are presently on asylum in Sweden pending our release. I do not want this to happen to my husband, so that is why I contacted you. In closing, I want you to understand that my share of the money is for political asylum. You will be entitled to 20% as gratification, while the balance will be for the investment. I look forward to your earliest reply via email. Yours faithfully, Evan Abbadala. _________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

Title: IMMEDIATE REPLY NEEDED.
 IMMEDIATE REPLY NEEDED. I am George Dembé, the accountant general of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He succeeded in getting the funds that belong to my client the former chairman of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Sani Abacha, who died in 2nd of October 1999, here in Nigeria. You shall read more about the Abacha family  crisis on this website:  http://www.ngr.net/abacha099.htm Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claims of these funds, as his next of kin, this is why I contacted you for your assistance to claim the funds as close of kin to the deceased. The monetary amount involved is (USD Ten Million United States Dollars Only)   $10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) As you may know, the laws and constitution of Nigeria do not allow citizens of country to open account in this central bank so I need your consent to account for me here in Nigeria. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email, indicating your details, your banking address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and also your Family Name, if any. I shall then forward your information to the accountancy firm for further instructions including the source of the funds. The banking law and constitution of Nigeria do give legal rights to all citizens over 18 years of age to have bank accounts and foreign exchange accounts, so this is necessary to enable me start preparations for an accountancy firm in your country. If you agree to my terms, I will furnish you with the address where the account is registered. You can contact me through my email, on the contact page.

Title: Pictures of you
 Pictures of you Dearest One, Please this letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am The Duke of Burgundy,the second son of late King Charles X. My birth father was the former Royal Minister of Petroleum and Resources in charge of petroleum resources in abidjan, the homelands of Benin Republic. We were the only children of late Mr. and Mrs. Charles X,my mother was a strict religious fundamentalist who believed that God only intended for man to serve God and man was made in God's image. My father was falsely accused of plotting to remove the head of state Charles X from power. My mother was able to persuade the French government to hand him over to the government of President Charles X for trial. Presently, he is in jail facing war crime charges for allegedly ordering the death of his business associates. My father used my name as my only relation in securing the necessary documentations to obtain the documents that would enable him transfer out the sum of$21.5 million dollars (Twenty five million five hundred thousand United State Dollars) from one security company in continental Europe. My father really wanted to present himself as the new head of state but he was secretly arrested by the French authorities while he was on a visit to abidjan. Although he is currently in prison awaiting trial. I am presently undergoing treatment for cancerous ailment and need medical attention. My condition is very critical. As soon as my doctor confirms that I am not going to die, I will like you to send to me the contact details of a psychiatrist that will explain more on how we can proceed. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. Kindly send me your contact details along with your full name and address, telephone and fax numbers, so that i can give you more directions on how to proceed.

Email:wahili_at_pacific_email@tiscali.co.uk Dear Sir,              (RE:PROPOSAL) We are deeply involved in this request.We have in our possession a file, A datum (a file) in our foreign remittance department that consists of a sealed and confidential cable  which was sent to a foreigner by our foreign remittance director. On the 21st of August 2000,an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr.David Roberts made a numbered time (Fixed) order for fourteen (14)pence sterling  to be paid into our foreign remittance department, we arranged for an audit to be carried out on the contract and found out that the total contract cost to him was US$12 million US dollars and was finally approved.  Your name and address as the foreigner will assist in the audit. After the contract was finally approved by our foreign remittance director, we removed the sealed envelope containing the order form and the document signed by the contractor, and in the presence of my clerk he was able to slide the order form out of the file and show me who he was claiming it from. I made comments in the file that the order should be claimed by a lawyer and that the Nigerian government does not approve contract for foreigners to do contract work, therefore I will like you to send me the information as the beneficiary of the contract to claim the contract from the The government. The contract can be claimed by mail, fax number or e-mail address, your company name, your direct phone and fax number and your company's address. If you are interested, I would need from you the following information: Your full name and address, full company name and address, private telephone and fax numbers.

Title: from   reginald alexander                                       BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGUINBURG-BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA.   DEAR FRIEND,                                                 CONFIDENTIAL Please I must solicit your absolute confidence in this transaction. I am the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance  department of BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) here in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. I  found an abandoned sum of $7.2million United States Dollars (Seven Million Two hundred Thousand United Std.        US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire familly in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website: http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/index.html http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/newsletter.html http://www.wdr.com/newsletter/2003/jul/18/20/a.html Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and daughter) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,the request must be made by a Burkinabe. You shall be compensated with 15% of the total money for your assistance. I will need from you a simple and specific  return address. I will use my position and influence to effect in the transfer of this funds to your nominated account. If you are interested, please reply with details and your direct telephone numbers (fax) so that we can discuss this transaction further. After this is done, we shall share in the ratio of 30% for us and 60% for you. Upon your response, we shall provide you with more details on how this transaction will be executed.  Happy hailing to you. Regards, Reginald Alexander A. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger! Download today it's FREE!

Title: From Rich

From Rich Dear, I am Rich, a Libran by father and grandfather. I was born in the year 1831 in the city of Kisumu in the province of Abidjan. I am married to Dr, Amalia. We were married for about 6 years without a child. Before my marriage to my elder sister, my father was the Vice President of the Republic of Cote D'Ivoire while he was the head of state. In the year 2002, the then president of the republic, named me as his only daughter and moved that I should look for a husband as his only son. After about four months we got word that my father had been poisoned to death by one of his bodyguards while on an official trip to Portugal before his burial. Since then I have been living as the wife of my late husband. Before his death on March 15 2003 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire. Before his death I visited the grave of my late husband and laid claims to his money estate in the name of my only son, that my husband had some sum of money in different accounts abroad. I have made a will to the office of the transfer agent in Cote D'Ivoire but it was never executed. The account opened by my late husband was for the deposit of ten million real dollars with a security company in Europe. I am now soliciting for your assistance to assist in the transfer of this funds abroad. This transaction is 100% risk free. In order to save the company a lot of money in legal fees, my husband was poisoned with his bodyguard. Also it was during this time that he in fact told me the real reason for his ill health and the reason he will not be able to run the company anymore. He also told me where he kept the deposit certificates issued to him by the security company when he deposited the amount with them. Also he said that he will like to use this to build his business of of real estate in the London and the Asian countries as well as buy arms and ammo for his private army of private security guards. Please be honest while you are considering the transaction, so that I can go over your itinerary and agreement to reach an agreement on your part. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please contact me as soon as possible to discuss further on how we can proceed with this. Please contact me only through my email address above or you can send your reply through my email address below. I look forward to your quick reply.

Title: Hello.
 Hello. My name is Dr Azeez Mamoon an accountant with a company here in Cotonou Benin.I need your sincere co-operation to make this work ok for me. I am the personal accountant to Prof.Songsun Ebakan, the former president of Benin Republic. He is presently residing in Benin with his wife and three children, and this is the reason I require your assistance to present you as the next of kin of the deceased. Already he has a share in several companies in south and east Africa, and some of these companies is cloned, some is real and some is not. So how does he got the sum of $7.5million (Seven million five hundred thousand United States Dollars) which is still residing in one of the companies he cloned. He told me that he wanted to use this money to purchase weapons and ammunition with his friends and to support his family in their business in the United States of America, Canada and Scotland. He didn't tell me where in the world the money was, I only found out about this along with the rest of the information about the unfortunate incident that took place in (my country) during one of his outings to Canada. His plane crashed into a milliganberry in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada, and all the passengers and crew members of the aircraft died, and have not been heard of since.You can also search the web on the following websites for more information about the incident: &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://www.dw.com/news/3460464_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.hoovers.com/mt_stories/mt_stories/hoovers05/hoovers05.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.moneycom.co.uk/stories/national_news/stories.aspx?story_id=6969&amp;gt; &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/WORLD/WORLD/02/26/world/africa.html&gt; &lt;http://www.vox.com/article/2007/4338/1407003.html&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct18?language=printer&amp;h=st1&amp;tb=malink&amp;p=&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/x/ac2120d10dfe38a26f5a44f/a65457fd2_c//http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-benin.asp?pim=story.page&amp;h=p&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/somesmall_mini_heroes.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/heroes.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct18?language=printer&amp;h=st1&amp;tb=title&amp;opinions&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/mechanicsandtech.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/machinesandtech.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/essays/essays.asp?n=52&gt; &lt;http://www.rense.com/general32/essays/essays.asp?th=25778&amp;px=250&gt; &lt;http://www.rense.com/general32/essays/essays.asp?th=25778&amp;px=250&gt; &lt;http://www

The total amount in question is (USD10.5M) Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only.

The actual money is presently in a security company hideout in Germany and will be activated and claimed by the end of this financial year. Consequently, I need a reliable person to present as the next of kin to this fund to enable the funds to be released to him. I will pay 20% of the funds to you for your assistance, while the remaining 70% will be for me.

 PLEASE REPLY TO: johnnando123@yahoo.com  Good Day,        I am John Nando the President of COTON INTERNATIONAL PLC. I am 32yrs old and a citizen of cote d�vila. I work with a very well reputable company called:  COTON INTERNATIONAL (CAR) and we have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On OctOBER 2006, my clients a civil engineer and a manager of a highly reputable petroleum engineering firm in Europe came to our storage unit and had a contract awarded for their company. This contract was for the concrete line that serves the company's main export refinery in Cotonou-Brussels, which  was made under the auspices of the Côte d�Ivoire Government. The contract was supposed to be awarded to our company in 2005 but was unfortunately passed over to our foreign customer after some months in procurement process. More details about the contract can be found on our web site www.cote.info/Data/Contracts/10609f.htm. Since then we have been forced to look for a contractor for this transaction because the government of cote d�ivoire bought on our behalf some supplies of cement in order to meet that of the foreign contractor. We, who are a small team of engineers managed to scrounge up a load of cement (10 tons) and shipped it to your country, where we are now taking delivery.   BUT before we proceed it is necessary to secure an affidavit of trust from you to enable us claim this cargo from the oncoming authorities and the shippable status of the consignment is acquired. This is done in this manner. Below is the completed application we will need from you. You are required to send an email to obtain the appropriate email address and other details required for the transaction. Please include your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication during the business. Thanks for your understanding during the transaction. Please kindly keep this confidential and you shall be congratulated in your mailbox.

Title: dear
 dear Dr. Suleman Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire. Dear Sir, I am the accountant general of Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire. I write to seek your partnership in transferring the money (US$15.million)  dumped in our currency bank here into a safe foreign account. I possess the required information from the security company in Cote D"ivoire about the deceased and will provide you with the details upon your registered number which I will send to you later. I am writing to you as a foreigner due to the restrictive immigration laws in my country. My boss was a very wealthy Cote D"ivoire businessman. His company was the sponsor of a certain very important coty trade that involves the transfer of considerable amounts of money from time to time to avoid customs duties and taxes. He made this money when he was on a trip to Europe in 2000. He deposited the sum of $15.million dollars (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security company. Unfortunately, this money was declared "undisclosed" by the security company. I now solicit for your partnership to help me claim this money from the security company and transfer it into your account as the beneficiary/next of kin/benefactor of the money. It is a legitimate and legitimate business. As soon as it is claimed, I will come down to Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire to further my education and to secure a legitimate bank account in your name which I shall provide for you with instructions on how to execute the transaction. Please, understand that this transaction is 100% risk free because I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up all the paperwork. Please, entertain the utmost confidentiality,and a flush deal. Please, treat with utmost urgency. Please contact me via my private email address (dr_suleman1@netvigator91.com).

As it was, I was pressured from the onset of the Nigerien war to terminate the contract before it was consummated. As it was, i discovered that Mr. John Sunoco, the contractor, had a claim on the contract which he intended to award me. When I discovered this, I promptly consulted with my lawyer and instructed him to prepare the necessary documents to back up his claim, which documents to submit to the NNPC. We had our lawyer prepare the deficiency reports of the two contracts, and the documents to back up the contracts claims. As it was, we were successfully able to obtain the Contract Execution Documents which outline the contract as executed and commission payments due.Please note that we do not want to use my position to secure any illegal contracts, hence I ask for your full co-operation to render me the necessary assistance. As the expert in this transaction, I know what goes into a contract and I want your firm opinion to help me understand the transaction. Firstly, let me explain the difference between the ENGINEER AND THE MANAGER JOINED IN THE CONTRACT. The ENGINEER JOINED IN THE CONTRACT AND THE MANAGER HAS THE PERMISSION TO HEAR AND FILE CLAIMS ON THE ABOVE CONTRACT.

I WANT YOU TO ASSURE ME THAT THIS MONEY WILL NOT BE TRIED OVER IN THE BANKING PROCESS AND THAT THE MONEY WILL BE SHARED PIVATELY.THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO AVOID THE OVER-INVOICED CONTRACTS FROM ARRAYING IN THE COMPANY, I WANT YOU TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST BY RETRIEVING THE MONEY AND SENDING ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER, FAX NUMBER FULL NAME AND ADDRESS TO ENABLE ME FILE LETTER OF CLAIM TO THE FUND FROM YOUR ACCOUNT.BECAUSE MY HONEST AND HIGH CONTRACTORS ARE CALLED AWARE OF ALL NECESSARY MODALITIES FOR THE VERIFICATION AND INFLATION OF CONTRACT, WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRANSACTION.

 ASSISTANCE. Dear Sir/Madam, I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise, especially as we have not met before.I understand that this may come to you as a surprise to you as well, as we have not met before,but be careful of who you ask for assistance.I am Mr.Michael.Kuhn from Germany and the Manager of Private Banking Services,We had a client (MUSTAFA TRADING PLC)who deposited a huge sum of amount (US$12.5m) with our bank,and the bank managementis not aware of this deposit,as the account belongs to ONE of our clients Late Mr. Oliver Hazard John who was the former Chief of Staff to the President of the COCA-NCB (national Confederation of the Cocoa Export Promotion Board).You shall read more about the crisis in the news media,but you can go to http://www.cocana.com . To the disappointment of both of us,he died since 1999,and no other person knows aboutthis deposit,so the account shall remain in the custody of the bank.I believe thatyou will understand very well, the reason why we need your assistance.My client is a foreigner, and a civil servant, so he did notknow that he deposited this huge sum of money in our bank,because he was not a citizen,and it was made for civil works project in our country.As civil servant,he was not aware that he deposited the fund in our bank,because as a government employee he wasnot supposed to be allowedinside our bank premises.As soon as he was made aware of this, he was sent home and all his papers concerning the fund were destroyed.We have not had any body to come to claim the fund from the security company where the fund originated,so we issued a notice to claim the fund within the next seven or eight workdays, upon your return from work. He has received death threats for bringing this matter to our bank,so we will have to use this opportunity toandotake advantage of it. If you are interested,please reply immediately for us to discuss this further. Thanks and God bless, Mr.Michael.Kuhn

Title: ATTENTION!!
 ATTENTION!! Good day.I  worked with a reputable bank here in Cotonou Benin in west Africa for more than 4 years.One of our clients,a Burkinabe engineer by name, made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Six millions Five hundred thousand United States Dollars only, with a bank here in Cotonou Benin. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him,even when the bank officials here in Cotonou Benin got to know about the deposit.I was the official account officer to the late Mr. Tony Danuja who was a citizen of republic of Benin and a native of Damascus,Benin.  On the 21st of January 2002,a truck driver by name, drove past my office and into a wall of a dynamite factory and died.And since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this deposit,because the head of security of the bank here in Cotonou Benin is dead as well. Also it is my conviction that there is no reliable person in this business,as I have had sufficient experience from my days in the security industry. So I make this proposal to you and release you from the responsibility to come up with a plan of where to invest the money. As the account officer to the deceased head of security, you will claim this money and share it with me. I will present my share to the bank official in charge of the deposit and the money will be shared as follows: 70% to me and 30% for me and you.Should you agree to my proposal.send me an email with the subject LINEAR Follow me on my personal web site: www.mon_biome.com Reply me here: brennan@mon_biome.com for more information. Reply me here: www.mon_biome.com Good day.I  want you to be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. Mon_Biome.com,please,i look forward to your response.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED ! Assalamualaikum! I am Baron James,the personal attorney to late General Sani Abacha (the great general who ruled Nigeria under the Abacha family for over four decades). I received your details through an official government directory in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction of this nature. I decided to contact you for your assistance in this regard, as we will be using your name to secure a US$25 million dollar contract with a foreign contractor to be executed in your country between the years 2000 and 2007. Note that the validity of your data is not in question.  Before my late father died, he was the general manager of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and he had a contract with the US government to supply gas to cashed tankers in the US for about four years.  The contract was finally paid for by the government in 2005.  After my father's death, my mother took me so special. She asked me to look for a reliable foreigner to assist us in this transaction in your country. I am willing to help you secure this contract so that you can use it against the government if you wish. However, be assured that this transaction is 100% risk free and is 100% legal.  Please note that this transaction is confidential and should be treated as such. I would appreciate if you send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication.

 FROM:DR.ANDREW JACK FROM:ANDREW JACK DR.ANDREW JACK,OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. EMAIL:andrewjack@t-online.com Dear Sir, I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise. I am the personal account officer to late Dr.ANDREW JACK, the former President of Liberia. He made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, valued at US$18,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only), on September 1996 for 60 calendar months, on my branch . Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even after the government of Liberia declared the fund in the treasury as unclaimed, and as such the government discontinued all payments to the  Curtate account. A standing order of the Burkina Faso (Burkina Forest Official) states that any account not claimed within 14 calendar  days, the account will be credited to the government treasury. Over the years many Liberian Government officials have gone about their business without knowing the full details of the fund, and it is this very lack of knowledge which is the cause of the current crisis in the country. In my office I am collecting information from various Government departments on who is the original owner of this account , and what amount should be done about it. I need a reliable foreigner who can provide this information to me so that I can provide the necessary information in writing. As I said, the information you will provide is required, so please provide your contact address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. What I wish to relate to you may be of interest to you, but be advised that this transaction is 100% risk free. As I said, I have daily contact with some of the top Government officials in the country about this issue, and they too, are silent on this matter. What I require from you is a thorough knowledge of the American political economy, and how the money is structured, and also a deliberate effort to keep all the modalities of this transaction secret. If you are interested in assisting me at all levels, the level of detail you will provide will be extremely important. Your position in this transaction will be based on the total sum you will provide, not on your gender or any other aspect of your identity. Your role in this transaction is completely confidential, and under no circumstances will you be told of the transaction, let alone required to participate. If you are interested, forward your reply to me immediately, indicating your email and fax numbers for easy communication, to enable me commence the transaction immediately. I will then forward you on the next line of action to take, and finally, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. Please do not be rude or elitist in your response, as I do expect a fairly impressive amount of contribution from you. Please please, reply to my email address and include your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.

From: Dr.Marcus M. Ambrose  Subject: URGENT, CONFIDENCTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL   I AM DR. Marcus M. Ambrose, the accountant general of Benin republic of Benin. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 24, 1999, a foreign oil consultant/contractor with the Government of Benin, Mr. George H.W.Brumley made a contract proposal to my office. He mentioned in his application that he wants to employ five Benin nationals on a fixed contract work worth $11.5million US dollars with my office. Unfortunately, all his specified benchmarks were not met during the negotiation process. During the course of our investigation, my office uncovered a floating  account with the sum of (US$11.5million) with the Central Bank of Benin. I now plan to withdraw the money from the Central Bank of Benin and deposit it with a Security Company in Europe, preferably one that will provide high security and high overall level of assurance as regards to the security of the funds. Please note that during the course of our investigation, we discovered that the account holder is dead. He died since 1995 and no next of kin is alive to claim this money from the Central Bank of Benin. I now need a new contract applicant who will claim this money from the Central Bank of Benin and then I will send to you all the details on how the funds will be secured and secured to avoid any kind of accident. There is no risk involved. I have carefully considered the details of the contract and selected the best bidder that will assist me in this regard. Bidders will include all legal documents to enable you claim the funds. I will supply all documents that will enable you claim the funds. All you have to do is to simply send me the following information below,and I will attach you to the contract on incorporation. Your full names, address, telephone and fax numbers, corporate and residential address, company or apartment you are interested in the contract. I expect your contact address and personal account details to enable my lawyer contact you on the need for a legal representative. You shall not share any interest personally if you do not indicate your interest. The transaction will run for (15)years and the contract will be renewed every five years with the same terms and conditions. I do not care if you are not interested in the contract or not. All that is required from you is to indicate your interest. This will enable the process of funds transfer to commence. Please be informed that this transaction is 100% risk free. Please contact me as soon as possible on my private email address:   email:  maximusreg@indiatimes.com Yours faithfully,  Dr. Marcus M. Ambrose.

Title: ASSITANCE
 ASSITANCE Dear Friend, With warm heart I write you this proposal in good faith but with due sense of family as well as the new initiatives of our President, I do not see any reason why this proposal or information regarding it cannot be released to you. I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person. I have a patient case that involves the transfer of a huge amount of money to your country. This sum amount to quite a lot of money, likely to be in the region of $10.5 million dollars. This money has been on deposit in a bank in West African country since the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, the country had already elected their first president in June, and the President was impeached on August 21. The President had been in office for less than four years. The day before his impeachment, he told my client about his intention to use his office to enrich himself and a few close associates, that included myself, he also mentioned how much he owed the US Government in the form of foreign and local taxes. An amount that has been on deposit in the bank for more than three years now. I have made all efforts to have the matter be processed as a family transaction but with the President's position as the Head of state and the country Government, the process can not be carried out with impunity. Donald J.Bilon, the former President of the Republic of Congo and former Head of state of the Federal Republic of Congo, was the former head of state. He was impeached by the Constitutional Court of the Federal Republic of Congo for violating the oath of office he took as the Head of State on January 20, 2004. The articles of impeachment against him can be found in the website as at August 20, 2003. The first article of the article states: "ARTICLE 1. OFFSHORE BANKING. The President makes an unlimited supply to this bank by means of offshoring and foreign transfer of funds within the Republic of Congo. The President makes this supply in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Congo as amended by the 1990 Constitution and laws of the Republic of Congo. The President authorises this bank to make payments to foreign contractors as may be required, upon request from the Government of the Republic of Congo. A contract executed by the President and executed by the Federal Government of the Republic of Congo has the force of law and is honored. The existence of this contract, and the information concerning it with the firm to which it was submitted to was made openly available to the public by the firm, both by the President and in the publications of the newspapers published in the capital of the Republic of Congo. In the course of processing these types of contracts, my client was assisted by several top Government functionaries, who were actively involved in bidding wars which took place on both sides of the conflict in West African. The President of the Republic of Congo at this time was the President of the Republic of Congo, who is also the head of state. They successfully concluded several contracts with the above-mentioned firms. These projects were carried out under a legitimate arrangement approved by the President of the Republic of Congo and submitted for certification by the firm where the projects were carried out by my client. All relevant documents to this contract are with us now. As it stands now, the Republic of Congo Government does not know about this contract, the amount involved or the source of the funds. They are the only party which has information concerning this contract, as they have been instructed to do under the Civil Service Code of Conduct, which reads as follows: "Civil Service Code of Conduct, Part II: Political, Economic and Social Policies". This regulation, which was signed into effect on July 1, 2003, states that if any employee of the Government of the Republic of Congo knowingly and willfully violates this Code, he or she will be punished with up to seven years in prison. In the course of preparing for this upcoming election, my client had in his possession some old files containing data of contracts executed by his former boss, which were deposited with a private firm in the European Chamber of Commerce and Trade. These files contain the names and contact addresses of numerous foreign contractors who were involved in the projects, as well as their associated companies and their contact email address. In order to enable my client to draw up the necessary documents to present to the Government of the Republic of Congo as regards to this contract, he had in his possession a 'DEAL' certificate issued by the European Chamber of Commerce and Trade. This contract was executed by one of France's biggest construction company and one of the world's leading Contracting Parties. The total amount involved is (US$10.5million dollars) ten million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars only. The European Chamber of Commerce and Trade does not know the identity of the contractor because they do not want to incriminate the Government of the Republic of Congo by naming them against their oath of office.

Title: From Mr. andrew grayson
 From Mr. andrew grayson DR LADY ANDRES WINTERS, AFRICAN REPUBLIC. Dear Sir, It is a great pleasure to write to you. I am Mrs. Andrew grayson a citizen and a partner in the law firm of ludovicaw. I work in the human resources department in the chief legal officer of ludovicaw, in the Ministry of Labor and Employment. The subject of this email is an application for a contract modification by ludovicaw to the Ministry of Labor and Employment. On July 6, 1998, a contract with an initial value of  $15.5million was executed by a consortium led by  West African Industrial Qualifier Ltd in the name of many foreign contractors in the  capitals of  the African continent. Upon the signature, delivery and payment, the contract was sent through the standard courier  service to ludovicaw's contract office in Abidjan to my humble office. With my position as the chief legal officer I was the only one in the office who saw the contract when it arrived and I noticed that the sum  was already in the judicial registry. There is no way it can be submitted to the President for approval as the foreign contractor of record. This sum was paid to the government of Sierra- Leone. If I do not act fast to effect the transfer of this money out of  the country immediately, by end of the year 2000 the government will have paid for the unsafe construction that was done under the obsolete  contract awarded to us by the West African Industrial Qualifier Ltd. I want to claim this money and use it for our own personal use and the honest foreigner can claim it as well. All we need from you is to indicate your interest in this deal and indicate your location where you will be in relation to the contract work. If you agree, we shall effect the transfer of the funds in your name. I will send to you the contract work Report of the contract commission. You will be paid 40% of the total sum. I anticipate your response as soon as possible. Kind regards, Mrs. Andrew grayson.

I am the manager of credit and  monetary policy of NIGERIAN POUNDS CENTRAL BANK. I decided to contact you for your assistance in carrying out a project of considerable  importance to me. I am the Federal Minister of Finance and Policy in Nigeria. I have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian  National  Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Oliver Smith made a fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, with a value of  US$26,000,000.00 with the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.)  (C.B.N.),  thereby making this contract commitment. Sometime between the date of deposit and the date the contract was executed, Mr. Oliver  Smith already passed away , and the money was successfully deposited with the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.) No other person knows about this deposit, and the account has no other beneficiary. Now I am aware that there are a lot of contract proposals going on in the banking world right now, and my boss wasn't the only one that made this fixed deposit with the Central Bank of  Nigeria (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.). Nobody else knows about this deposit either, as far as I know, the contract was executed by all the other contractors as well, and all they did was declare the contract as being with Central Bank of NIGERIA (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.) (CONSUMABLY DISCOVERED). Now I want to make a fresh start in claiming this money from the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.) (C.B.N.) (CONSUMABLY DISCOVERED), and I want you to do me a favour to stand as the next-of-kin to Mr. Oliver Smith, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials who will later use it to sponsor war in Africa and kill innocent civilians in the process. There is no risk involved, you can simply e-mail me with your direct and private telephone and fax numbers to enable me call or reach you at your convenience. I will supply the necessary documents and proof that you will need to claim this money from the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.) (CONSUMABLY DISCOVERED), which will later be forwarded to you by my lawyer. Please, be patient and continue to receive our correspondence via our new email addresses,nobody will ever know about this transaction.

Title: Hi friend
 Hi friend Dear friend I am Mr Bob   jones, the President and CEO of   a bank here in shabangu district of Lagos,   and also the husband of the former  first lady now living there,melanie jones. I heard that she has a suitcase full of  money in our bank,and that she wants to move the money to any of  her favoured foreign destinations, where the proceeds of this transaction should be paid into . I am aware that this transaction is  highly confidential and the value of this transaction is about $10.5 million United States Dollars. As soon as I read your mail I will send you the details that will enable you get this money into your account. Mel  l was married to, the president of Nigeria-Peace Corps, Mr. Paul  jones who was recently reelected as the first president of Lagos  after the turbulent rule of president of Nigeria (Mr. Muhammad udala) who  led to the killing of my husband. You can verify this from the website:  http://www.newscotland.com/bn/newsletter/archives/2006/02/read2.html Since my husband was accused of having committed some questionable  acts of war against my country,I have been threatened with war, government investigations and the like. Knowing my position in the country, I decided to transfer the majority of the  funds to a foreign account and made arrangements for a legitimate attorney to handle the funds and  transport them out of Nigeria as soon as possible.

 GOOD DAY  FROM: P. JOSEPH WEBSTER, DIRECTOR, BANKING, AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB). OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. PHONE: 234-80-55-84-89. My Good Day, I am Mr. Joseph Webb the Director of Banking at African Development Bank (ADB). Here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Before the death of my father (former Burkina Governor and former Minister of Finance ) General Sani Abacha the head of state of Burkina Faso-West Africa. He made up his mind to transfer some amount of money from one account (the Exchequer Account) to a personal account abroad. The Forfeited sum US$21.2m dollars is still with us and I respectfully request for your co operating as a foreigner in this regard. I am opposed to the idea that the head of state should have this kind of money on his private account. It will be very beneficial to you. I don't want your name used in the process as the accountant, that would be secret. If you accept this transaction, you are to send the details on deposit as a top secret/confidential file. No other person knows about this account except me and my father have decided to use this to disclose this deposit to another foreign. We cannot release the deposit to a third party unless someone applies for it as the next of kin to the deceased. It is a legal document and the bank will reject the claim of a non-existent next of kin. The request of a foreigner in this transaction is necessary as the money cannot be approved to a local person. Also, in view of my position in the bank, the owner of the account would be discharged from service if I were to discover that he is not the next of kin. Therefore, it is necessary to find somebody trustworthy who will apply for the claim and obtain the necessary documentation/documents as the beneficiary of the account. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of application in. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch free. Ownership of the account is not subject to the provisions of the Burkina Faso Banking Law. You will be entitled to 30% of any money remitted into your account as gratification, while the balance will be for the bank. Trustful and Responsive, P. JOSEPH WEBSTER,

Title: From Mr James
 From Mr James &gt;From Mr James loyds&gt; &gt;James B. Lloyds Citibank Plc,Durham, University of Sussex. EH? Good Morning and Good Day, Sir I am Mr. James B. lloyds the Auditor General of Citibank Plc Durham, United Kingdom. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On November 4, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. William B. Johnson made a numbered time (Fixed) order (NPC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)  on a contract for the pumping of crude oil into Metekom oil refinery in Abuja. On 2nd of April 2000, about 4:30am, a NNPC engineer/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Paul Bennet, made a routine check of the pumping schedule for the month of October 2000. He discovered an oil product (fixed), in the form of a trailer loaded with fixed rocks, which he unloaded and pumped the crude oil from the tanker, in violation of the fixed rock policy at the refinery. On further investigation, I discovered that the foreign contractor who had this contract did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including the contract document, which I will introduce to you later. I am contacting you because I wish to have a contract in which you stand as the beneficiary/next of kin/beneficiary, because the royalties accrued on the fixed oil product filed under your name have been transferred to me by the Nigerian public service commission. Therefore, I will like you as the foreign contractor to have a contract in which you can claim your share of the royalties payable under the foreign contractor. I will need a contract of at least two years duration with a term of 2(2) years. I have carefully considered the bid received by me from the other bidder and its validity, as confirmed by the firm, which I will present to you. Also, be informed that my share of the royalties will be in your name, and the contract will have provisions for a joint stockholder. I need your assistance in this transaction. You are allowed a commission of 20% of every money remitted over by the foreign contractor, while 5% is set aside for all incidental expenses incurred in the transaction. Please contact me as soon as possible on my private email address; &gt;jamesb_alton@netscape.net. Please also be informed that your position as a foreigner in this transaction is not a hindrance and that you will be highly rewarded, as you will be entitled to 10% of every money remitted over by the foreign contractor. I need your urgent reply or you can contact me via my email address to enable me know how we can proceed. You can also contact me on my fax number +234-40-720-1425 for more details.

 Willingness to act as you wish FROM: Anthony Mackie O.C.B.,P.O.BOX 198,190,Avant. 90,7067Birmingham,Birmingham,U. K.C To: From: Anthony Mackie Head:Sir, I am Mr.Anthony Mackie the Auditor General of CASH INTERNATIONAL PLC. I have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On November 8, 2000, CASH INTERNATIONAL PLC. in Nigeria, Dr.Niina Ashari the Manager of Petroleum made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, maturity 6/2/2007. On maturity, the bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but received no response. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, CASH INTERNATIONAL PLC. that Dr.Niina Ashari worked with them as a consultant/contractor. On further investigation, I'm afraid that my friend may have been the victim of late contract parties in his office. According to Nigerian Law, if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. My friend was involved in the drafting of a contract with a Chinese firm for the petrochemical plant in Lagos-Nigeria. The Chinese firm paid him the stated contract amount which was executed by the Nigerian company.According to Nigerian Law, if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. On this note, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the beneficiary of the fixed deposit so that the proceeds of this deposit will be transfer to your account as unclaimed fund. The contract was executed by the Nigerian company. The amount involved is (USD10.5M) Ten million, Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only. You are hereby informed that all correspondence must be made either to you directly or through your representative via email address above, and all correspondence must be direct and not by fax or email. This transaction is 100% safe and secure. All documents and origins are being kept totally confidential and secured with a combination of Top secret and Confidential files. I'm the only one that's privy to the details of this transaction. If you are willing to proceed, send us your direct phone, fax and email number for immediate start of the process.

Title: URGENT
 URGENT Dear Sir, Greetings to you. My name is mughnuma udine the Managing Director with the Commodity and Financial Group  of ABSA. I am the director of operations and bill and  exchange at the Commodity and Financial Group. I have an urgent and  confidential business proposal for you. On June 20, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian  National  Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Richard Kelso made a fixed deposit for  twelve calendar months, with a value of US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars). Upon maturity in 2002, the  Consulment mailed the above consular officer with the N.N.PC, to confirm the fixed deposit had been deposited in his name. Upon further investigation, it was  also discovered that Mr. Richard Kelso did not declare any next of kin in his official papers, including the paper work of his bank  register. The total sum of US$15M isn't clear to me because I don't want the government to look. Also, as the bill and  Exchange Manager of the Commodity and Financial Group, I know that money entering my bank  as payments to foreign contractors is usually dormant and confiscated . My proposal is that I am  prepared to give you 30% of the money if you will work with me on this  transaction, while 10% shall be for any expenses we may incur, in the event of  the breakdown between us. There is also the option of sharing  20% of the money between us, depending on the percentage of each of us we will share. 6.5% to me and my family while the remaining 5.5% shall be used for all expenses incidental or necessary to the successful execution of this  transaction. Please email me if you are interested in this transaction, as I have been  in continuous contact with some of the foreign contractors to enable us draft and send to you all necessary documents to enable our bank  remit the money. For security reasons, please send a return email saying how much is owed to you. This transaction should be executed under a legitimate method that  ensures the highest level of confidentiality. Please carefully read and follow the instructions given in this email from the above mentioned foreign contractor. Thanks for your cooperation. Please, kindly keep this business proposal carefully confidential. Good day, and may God bless. Yours faithfully, mughnuma  udine.

Though he is currently in the country he declared as his guest, he has declared that he does not know the actual content of the envelope, the nature of the business or have any details about the certificate of deposit. I have made efforts to contact the security company, but all attempts have proved abortive. It is because I have made efforts to contact the security company, and got no response. I have contacted the president of the security company, and have made up my mind to enlist your assistance in the transfer of this money to your country. He has promised to protect you if you are to stand as his foreign customer. If you agree to take part in this transaction, the transaction will be completed and the certificate of deposit issued immediately in your favor. I have both legal and charted procedures in place to ensure the successful conclusion of this transaction. The transaction has to be concluded before the end of this financial quarter of this year, when my partner has the necessary approvals and move into his account in my bank. If you are interested, please reply to the above email address with your complete details and operative details. Your contact details will be forwarded to you as soon as I receive a response. Thanking you for your willingness and understanding.

PLANE CRASH WEB SITE...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm.                ("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE") COMLIMENTS OF THE SEASON 2000, FIRST, I MUST SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRANSACTION.THIS IS BY  VIRTUE OF ITS NATURE AS BEING UTTERLY CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET.  HOWEVER AFTER SERIES OF PETITION WAS RECIEVED BY THIS PRESENT REGIME FROM FOREIGN CONTRACTORS AND INABILITY OF THE BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION FOR THE PAYMENT TO ITS FOREIGN CREDITORS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THEY MANDATED US TO CARRY OUT A CAREFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OVERDUE PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN CONTRACTORS. DURING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCESS, WE DISCOVERED AN OVERDUE PAYMENT TO A FOREIGN CONTRACTOR AND MANDATED US TO CARRY OUT A CAREFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OVERDUE PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN CONTRACTORS, TO DETERMINE THE PERCENTAGE AT WHICH THE OVERDUE PAYMENT SHOULD BE PENDING. UPON THE DISCOVERY OF AN OVERDUE PAYMENT TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS, WE INTEND TO COMPLETE THE RESTATEMENT AT OUR OWN DISCREET. DURING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCESS, WE DISCOVERED ANOTHER OVERDUE PAYMENT TO A FOREIGN PARTNER WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN APPOINTED TO THE BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)OCTOBER FIVE EIGHT YEARS AGO. THIS MONEY WAS ACTUALLY APPROVED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES OF THE YEAR 2000 AND THE NUMBER OF PERCENTAGES ADVISED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES HAS BEEN INCREASED TO FIVE PERCENTAGES OF THE SUM. IT IS FROM OUR COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THAT THE OVERDUE PAYMENT WAS DETERMINED AND ADMINISTRATED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE PERMITS TO MAKE THIS ARRANGEMENT UNLESS WE DISCUSS IT OR THEY WILL MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT.

WE HAVE AGREED THAT OUR RATIO OF RATIO OF BENEFICIARY WILL BE AS STATED THUS; 30/70 RATIO FOR ALL OTHERS, 10/10 RATIO FOR US, 5/5 RATIO FOR OTHERS AND HIGHLY FOREIGN CONTRACTORS.  HOWEVER DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM INVOLVED, WE HIGHLY AGREE THAT 30/70 RATIO SHOULD BE USED TO INDICATE ONUSES.TO ARANGE FROM 30/70 RATIO TO 10/10 RATIO TO INDICATE ONUSES, WE WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF $150 MILLION US DOLLARS TO THE AMOUNT OF $200 M  DAYS REMITTANCE, WHICH WE SHALL INDICATE, FROM THE AMOUNT OF $50,000 USD. UPON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A FOREIGN PARTNER, WE WILL CIRCUMVENTATE THE TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS FROM THE BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OCTOBER FIVE EIGHT YEARS AGO TO THE AMOUNT OF $100,000 USD, WHICH WE SHALL INDICATE, FROM THE AMOUNT OF $50,000 USD. OUR BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH FUNDS REMAINED UNCLAMED

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On october 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the government of Saudi Arabia, with the rank of Vice-President to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Prince Mohammed made a contract for the storage of United State of America Dollars in various financial and precious metals companies in the world. When he made this contract, he made it to hold the contract for the storage in a company in europe, and he made a gratuitious 32 million United State Dollars (US$32m) as the sum of $12.5m United State of America Dollars in the contract. Though the contract has been invovled, he kept the contract to his private account for security reasons. And there is no director of the contract, there is only a Contract Director who joined through the proxy of the contractor in the form of a secretary who is an American, Mrs. Ruth Schouwenberg.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine for both of us. Without your full cooperation, this project will be over in seconds for us. And if you accept to become the beneficiary of this contract, you will be required to send me your Company's name, contact address, private telephone and mobile numbers,and your full name and address to enable me send you the documents and letter of application.

 CAN I TRUST YOU? FROM THE DESK OF DR.JULIO RICARDO SENIOR AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO (OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO). 7 WEST HIGHLY NIGERIAN SEAS, BURKINA FASO. Email:jrricardo@yahoo.com Dear Sir/madam, I am the manager of auditing and accounting unit of BANK OF AFRICA(BOA) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten million five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in December,2002 in an Air Crash, that took the life of his second son who was with him at the time.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is necessary because our client was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner,we agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner,while 10% will be set aside for all involved parties. I and other officials in my department have agreed that thirty per cent of this money will be for you as foreigner partner while 10% will be set aside for all involved parties. All legal documents to claim this money will be carefully, carefully worked out and it will be in your custody until we sign any legal document that will legitimise your role in this transaction. The agreement of all parties was that this transaction should be handled as quietly as possible with a close working relationship between you and me. The transaction has to be concluded before the end of this financial quarter of this year 2003. I hope to hear from you soon.

Title: Money  and cotenants
 Money  and cotenant From: Mr. Jamall bin Saeed Address: 17th Floor, 22, Jaafar Street, South London EC4A8LBR Dear Sir/Madam I am a British citizen and the Manager of Oil lab at Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia. I have urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On 30th of July 2000, an American oil engineer/contractor with the Saudi government named Mr. Edward Gross made a contract with Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia to install pump jacks and line pipes in pipeline segments of crude oil produced by some of our crude oil producing nations including Nigeria, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE and Algeria. As a matter of fact, he was the only foreigner that worked with this company and he died with his life in danger due to a security incident. Upon the discovery of his death, I and other officials of my position carried out a thorough search for the next of kin to this late contractor, which turned up no one. Moreover, the cause of his death was politically motivated and there is nobody that knows about this matter, the concerned offices of the Saudi Government have officially declared him as dead. So the sum of US$15 Million is deposited in a Insurance Company here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and the principal beneficiary is leaving no Will to serve again. He was born in Mexico City, Mexico but died overseas. And the law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Saudi treasury as unclaimed fund. The above sum of US$15 Million remains unclaimed after this process. I have been appointed by the Ministers of the kingdom to reach agreement on the necessary modalities for the smooth transfer of this fund into your account. The transactions have to be concluded before the end of this financial year 2000. I and my colleagues have agreed that 25% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary, while the remainder will be for me and my colleagues. Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account, you are authorized to provide your Full Names, Address and Tel/Fax Numbers for easy and effective electronic communication and location where in the money is to be shared since the agreement stipulates that this fund will be shared. All other relevant information will be carefully considered before the finalization of the transaction and it is expected that the transaction will be concluded within approx. 5 banking days after you provide your detailed information and for us to go over the modalities. The transaction must be concluded within 5 banking days, or we will destroy the documents that defines the trust between us. Please provide your private phone, mobile, and fax numbers for easy communication during the transaction. This transaction is 100% risk free. I look forward to your response and I will provide the details and details of the transaction as soon as I receive your response. Please, keep this transaction private and as a top secret unless you are the person you intend to be the beneficiary.                                REMITTANCE OF $15MILLION DOLLARS ONLY REMAINING UNCLAMED AFTER 5 YEARS.

Title: RE: URGENT PARTNERSHIP
 RE: URGENT PARTNERSHIP Dear Friend, I am Dr Zuri Shabangu, an accountant with a reputable bank here in Accra-Ghana. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 2, 2002, an Iraqi Foreign Minister with the Iranian President went to my bank to discuss on business investments with me. Upon arrival in my country for his private business trip, the Minister made a stopover in Baghdad where he made a number of contacts with foreign investment consultants and fund managers. He also made some contacts with some Iraqi private and foreign investment companies. During his official stay, the Minister also made contact with the Deputy Minister of Finance and made some notification on the funding of various ministries. During the time of this contact, my client was making a very large deposits in my bank and the banking ethics here does not allow this kind of deposit with high value to stay more than 6 months. Accordingly, I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. This is simple, I will provide the necessary information needed by you to bring out the funds, but you will need to be ready to go into agreement with me on certain terms and conditions. Firstly, you will need to indicate your agreement by a return message to my private email address or the email address you used for filing your application, and I will provide the necessary information needed by me to claim the funds from the security company and send them to you. The rate I am willing to offer you is 20% of the funds, while the balance 10% will be for any accidental expenses we may incur during the process of this transaction. We shall discuss on modalities on your interest, but we shall enter into negotiations on the payment terms and manner in which we will be getting these funds. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my email address so we can go over the details. I will provide the details as soon as I receive back from you. Your position now as regards security company will be honored, as we shall be employed in consulting on the investment of these funds in the private sector, we are looking for skilled officers that will assist us in this transaction. Please note that this transaction is 100% hitch-free, and you should treat it as such. Kindly contact me via email (zshabangu12@yahoo.com) in order to enable us proceed. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Please contact me via email for urgent and confidential messaging via my email address: zshabangu12@yahoo.com Regards, Dr. Zuri Shabangu (Esq.) _________________________________________________________________ Don't just search.

Title: FROM MR.SUSAN
 FROM MR.SUSAN &gt;From The Desk Of, Chief Secretary, No.7 Government House,Burdwan,Cotonou,Benin. Email:biruy@yahoo.com Dear Sir,                         Please note: You are hereby notified that the above quoted sum amount was approved for payment to you by a bank here in Benin. This amount is some hundred million United State Dollars only. It is my pleasure to write you and to have your help to this transaction.  I am writing to inform you of a transaction that I hope will be of mutual benefit to both of us. We have in our possession some amount of money which I shall disclose to you as soon as you indicate your willingness to enter into this deal. The amount in question is (US$35,000,000.00) Ten Million United States Dollars only . I have already made up my mind to over-invoiced the said amount to the bank here because the management is ready to approve the payment to any foreigner who has correct information of account, which I shall reveal to you as soon as I receive your willingness and resolve to enter into this deal. The reason why I have over-invoiced the mentioned amount is that the managing director of the bank is against the over-invoicing of this account and has ordered me to issue you notice of the over-invoicing. The reason why I do not have this information in my possession is because I was on assignment in a neighbouring country at the time and did not see any record of this account. As a matter of fact I know nothing about this account because I have not gone into the office and is unable to collect the amount in my possession. All I know is that some time late last year, my boss went into a store and purchased some cheap movie tickets but upon arrival at the store, he discovered that the tickets he purchased were nothing more than cash, which the manager had approved for payment. The manager has since instructed me to report to his office for their total over-invoicing of this account.  He also instructed me that the management would want the money to be paid to any foreigner that they may employ to stand in as the beneficiary of the money. I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The management here has instructed me that if this money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I must state at this point, that the management is ready and willing to pay for any foreigner who has correct information of the account, which I shall disclose to you as soon as I receive your willingness and resolve to enter into this deal. I can do this because the money is in a segregated account with a security company and the manager now can declare the content to whoever he wishes. I need only your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. The deal will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. If you are interested, kindly send me the following information below by email to enable us commence the transaction. Your full name, address, phone and fax numbers. Your residential or company address to enable me forward your contactto enable us discuss further.  I do not need to remind you of the importance of being honest to yourself and to other people in your life. With the help of God and my partner, we shall make amazing achievements together.  You are free to negotiate your own rates and terms of which you wish to be paid. I do not know about you, but I feel that 20% of this money will be of my own making, while the balance will be for the management team.  Please reply with your direct contact and private email address where you can be reached whenever you need it.  You can contact me with the email address above in 24 hours, in case you need. I shall also include your private private or company address to enable you reach me anywhere. I wait your urgent reply via my personal email.  Yours in Christ,      BRITISH ASSOCIATION. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

MOHAMED a financial Attorney based in Lagos, Nigeriawith my office in the Nigeria law firm.I have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you.On June 5, 1999 a U.S. military contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria,with the help of two other contractors,filled a series of underground well(s)near their quarters in the Federal Government compound in the city of Abuja in the northeast of Nigeria.And then their oil well(s)were exploded by the members of the Federal Government, killing at least 125 people and causing considerable damage to the buildings and properties of the Federal Government of Nigeria.Since then my position in the Federal Government has been precarious as a matter of law. And as a matter of fact, as of now there is no candidate to take my position as the next of kin.Thus,my proposal to you is that I am prepared to furnish you with the necessary information as regards to the origin of the funds(US$17.5M and 14.5M in total)in question. I will however require your commitment to handle the information and the funds inside your country.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.And once the funds are in your custody, you will be allowed to use them as you see fit,subject to the guidelines above stated.Please, you have been advised to keep this proposal very secret and preferably treated as top secret. May God be with you as you go about your daily business.I await your positive response.Please, you can always contact me at my private email address&gt;k_mohammed2002@yahoo.com,your private, confidential and confidential contact address of which I wish to confide in you.&gt; ________________________________________ How to raise a million dollars in under 7 minutes http://www.quickstart.com

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMMITS INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT DURING THE TIME OF SALE FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY REASONS.

Title: FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP
 FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP Dear Sir/Madam, I am Paul Tiso, a solicitor to late Mr. Boniface Chris. REBELLO. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On September 5, 1998, Mr. Boniface Chris REBELLO a citizen of republic of Sierra-Leone in West African, made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, valued at US $60,000,000.00(C.M.) in a finance company in ABIDJAN, Cote D'Ivoire. Unfortunately, he died since 1998 having only been alive for three months, on September 12, 2002 in a plane crash of Alaska Air Line #63, with other passengers aboard. You can view this web site about the crash  http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/12/kenya.crash Since Mr. Boniface died, no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my client is the manager of the branch of Finance in my client's company. I want to implore you not to be rash in this regard, if you are the person that came up as the next of kin to Mr. Boniface after his death, you should have this in your account as the account details are exactly reversed on the certificate of deposit. I am contacting you because I want you to do me a favour to receive the deposit and release the funds to me within 7 working days, as the banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven years, the money will go back into the banking system as unclaimed fund. The amount in question is US$60,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). I want you to do me a favour by sending immediately the details of the account you wish to receive this deposit in, so that the money will be released to you in the same or next of kin and the fee will be paid to you.  I will work out the modalities, but you will be required as a matter of urgency to perform the following functions: - To stand as the next of kin to Mr. Tiso and claim the funds in your name. If you are interested in this function, please reply immediately via my email address and include your private phone and fax numbers to enable me contact you from time to time. Thanks and God bless you. Paul Tiso.

 Dear Friend. Dear Friend, May I at this point suggest that you do not assume that I am the best person in the world? I believe you understand? Well, this may be strange to you, but human nature is complicated. There may be times when we feel like loss of control, or left with no choice but to surrender. Such moments are called out calls, where there is a need for strength of character to face the situation and carry out a task threatened. Such calls are caused by situations like these: 1. When you are faced with the prospect of losing a significant amount of money (i.e. $10m). 2. When you are confronted by the prospect of being forced to sell your soul for cash (i.e. cash) 3. When you have nothing left but to give up your soul for your country (i.e. if you die during or after the conflict in Sudan). Such moments make you to think, what if this job really is impossible for me? What if it is not only a dream but a reality? Such moments make you to reflect, what if you really are a worthless piece of trash? What if you really are not capable of doing this job? What if I am not capable of carrying out this task?

On the 21st of April 2004, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients extended Relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you for the repatriation of the money and Equipment left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Particularly, the Central Bank of Nigeria, C.B.N.O (Central Bank of Nigeria) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin, or the account will be confiscated. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate any of my client's relatives, i have now decided to look for a next of kin to claim the account. I have successfully arranged for the release of the funds to your name and the account will be released to you on your behalf. Also, there is no risk involved, all documentations will be done by me and I have secured a security company that will assist me in the documentations.

 TRUST FROM: MR.MIKELU WOLFF  Attn: Dear,  RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE NEEDED Dear,  RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE NEEDED I am Mr. Mikael Wolff, the Auditor General of  Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N).I have an urgent and  confidential business proposition for  you.On April 9, 2002, an account with total sum of $8.7million dollars was opened in my bank in Lagos  and since then no account has been operated on this account again. On  further investigation, I found out that the owner of the account a foreigner by name  and a resident of Nigeria and his address was given in my annual report as usual.  The owner of this address is Mr. Asim Baweja, a Foreigner, and the manager of  a department of Nick Petroleum Corporation in Lagos, a well-known  petroleum service firm and he died since 2003, hence no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it.  Let me explain this to you.In August 2002, an oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian  National  Petroleum Corporation Mr. Asim Baweja made a contract with my bank  to deliver rocks and pipe  for a petroleum product distribution  contract. On September 2, 2003, while he was on the job, he  contacted my bank and with the help of my attorney he demanded  the payment of the $8.7million dollars and the rights to load the rocks  to the contract. My attorney and I are both lawyers and the contract has been  legally executed by the firm. The Contract is executed to the highest  standard and certified by the National Petroleum Corporation to serve as the  highest standard contract in the world. The National  Petroleum Corporation does in fact instruct the legal firm to  not load the rocks more than seven metres in any  direction. In case you are interested, I will give you the contact details of the  Attorney. Please, do not reply me if you are not interested because of the  necessity of the transaction. I need your full co-operation to make this  transaction prosper. You can contact him at the email address below or he can also call me on +234-2412881 for more details. Subject to your strict professional confidentiality, I solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. I will divulge  the nature of the transaction to you only if you indicate your willingness to the  transaction. Your willingness to enter into this deal is highly appreciated.

From:            &gt;Rodney Shettles.  Neutral(Relation) Dear Sir/Madam, I am the Manager of Pearl in Nigeria. I know that my email will come to you as a surprise. I am sending you this mail for a purpose that can favour both of us.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 3, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr.Roger Thompson made a fixed deposit for 14 calendar months, with an intent of putting up $12 million dollar. This deposit was made with the help of a security firm in Lagos  Nigeria. Upon maturity several notice was sent through my office to the bank. Again after these repeated attempts by the bank to contact Mr.Roger Thompson we  finally got in touch with a security firm in Nigeria who will serve as the front for the money to be put up by Mr.Roger Thompson.Upon maturity of this deposit the Federal Government of Nigeria sent a notice to the bank. This time the notice was sent by post and the money was finally picked up by the bank after some weeks.But as you shall know better then all this as the President of Nigeria  has declared war on any foreigner who stands in the way of his plans. As the President of Nigeria you may know that if you stand in the last bloodline of Mr.Roger Thompson you shall not be safe from the President's wrath. You currently intend on standing in the last line of bloodline of Mr.Roger Thompson, thus making you the only person that will be affected by this decision.I have already declared my intention to the President and my position has become clear. As soon as I am convinced of your integrity I shall make your position clear to him. I shall explain the pros and cons of the proposal as soon as I receive your positive response. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential and treat with seriousness. Please keep this business proposal top secret for security reasons. Please contact me on my contact information as soon as possible as soon as possible on my personal confidential email address, please also include your phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please treat this as strictly confidential for security reasons.

I sincerely wish to inform you that this transaction is 100% free of risk and troubles as the beneficiary is a foreigner and a civil servant,and any formalities will be handled according to the law and guidelines of the land. I am the lawyer(A Barris-John) representing Mr. Osvaldo Guei, a civil engineer by profession. He is the personal attorney to late President Machel of Angola, a military leader during Angola War, and former President of Angola-Cote d'Ivoire. He was falsely accused of masterminding the murder of political activist Mr. Robert Mugabe. As a result of the accusations, the president gave him arrest warrant and the authorities tried to remove all his financial resources from Angola. During the crisis in Angola, my client helped me to secure the funding which amounted to $5.5millionUS dollars. During the war in Angola, my client was falsely accused of leading an un-American-trained militia against my client and his associates. According to Angola law, any person found guilty of leading or leading an un-American-trained militia is liable to pay a fine of $5,500,000 (5 million United States Dollars). Mr. Osvaldo Guei is a foreigner and an educated Civil Engineer by profession. I obtained this information from my partner while he was on sick bed. According to Angola law, any person found guilty of this act will go to jail for five years. After this, he will be unable to operate any account that involves international link. That is why I contacted you for assistance in this transaction. As a civil engineer by profession, I know what foreign funds are capable of doing.

 FROM MRS INABOYO ABU Dear Beloved, I am Mrs. Inaboyo Abu, the wife of late Mr. Abraham Abu. I am 28 years old and the only child of late Dr. and Mrs. Nuruddin Abu. I got your contact from an old lady that owns a telephone comapnent in my country, I wish to reveal to you about my husband's predicaments because he is a Christian. My husband was a very wealthy and influential citizen of my country, but he also very politically active and wealthy. He used his money to fund the opposition parties and to promote the political agenda in my country. He also used his position as a former head of state to benefit the already well off few elite few in my country. Among the few elite few in my country was the late head of state, General Sani Abacha. He had a fixed deposit of US$4,500,000.00 (Four Million Five hundred Thousand US Dollars only) with the Central Bank of Nigeria. He died mysteriously in 1999 and no other person knows of this deposit or any thing concerning it, the deposit paperwork for this deposit stated that he deposited the money with my husband as his next of kin. As a matter of fact, the only person that knows of this deposit is myself, and I am the only person that knows of this deposit. I am contacting you because I want you to help me claim this deposit from the Central Bank of Nigeria. As soon as this deposit is claimed, I want you to go to the country where it is deposited and claim it yourself, or the person you wish to help in claiming it, you must claim this deposit with me or the person you wish to help. I want us to see eye to eye on this because no one else knows about this deposit or anything concerning it, I want us to see eye to eye on this because all the documentation for this deposit will be there for you to prove you are the rightful next of kin to this money. I may not be politically correct nowadays, but I believe the thing I need from you is an eye to eye relationship. If you are willing to help me claim this deposit with my husband, kindly, indicate your contact address, phone and fax numbers for easy communication so that we can go over the details. We have a great deal of funds this time of year, let me have your full details as soon as possible so that we can go over the details and use the money for investment in your country. Over to you, please reply urgently, this will make the processing of this transaction much more speedy. Please, treat this as confidential and your best effort. You can contact my private attorney at  hazim at (mccoy@mcguire.com) Regards and God bless, Mrs. Inaboyo Abu.____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Dear friend, Today I wish to introduce my self to you, I am Mrs.Mary Harrah Lacy from United Kingdom. I am married to Major John Harrah Lacy who was Staff in the Ministry of Information, and he was the former Minister of Information until his retirement on February 19th, 2002, and I was fortunate to have known him my whole life. I got your address from a very reputable website, which I will give you a brief introduction to if you are interested in helping in the matter of this letter. My husband was recently diagnosed with esophageal cancer of the esophagus, and my doctor told me he has about a year to go. Before his late husband was diagnosed with esophageal cancer he was very wealthy and after his last meal with his wife at his resort in Cotonou, Benin they went to the hospital and later died. Before his death he told me that he deposited a sum of £15.5 Million British Pounds in a security company in Amsterdam, Netherlands that he intended to use for security reasons but he was prevented from doing so when the government of Netherlands passed new financial control laws that made it illegal to own more than five million British Pounds in one security company.It is from these funds that I seek your assistance in this transaction. Before his death my husband was married to Dr.Sami Harrah who is a very influential and well-connected person in the United Kingdom and also a Member of Parliament. They were married for 38 years without a child. Before his death he told me that he deposited some money in another security company that he used me as his account officer in depositing the sum of £15.5 Million British Pounds with the intention of using it for security reasons but I did not know that it was for security reasons I deposited it in the company because I thought it was destined for use for investment purposes in the United Kingdom. It is only an insider that finds out about these funds in other people's names and this is why I will give you the details of the deposit and the reason why it was deposited with us. We shall discuss on business investments when I have your details when I get back from Brussels. I will demand for your return delivery of the consignment containing the consignment if you do not deliver it within 14 working days for either party to have the funds transferred to another party's custody or account. Please also note that you will be entitled to 20% of any remuneration you receive from this transaction. Your earliest response to this letter is expected after 14 working days. You can contact me immediately by sending to my private email address: mrmary_mary_maryhra@mail.com You can also write to me on the note below, preferably it will be by return mail.

Title: ATTENTION PLEASE
 ATTENTION PLEASE Dear Friend, It may come to you as a surprise that I contacted you for this business proposal; however, I believe you will be highly compensated for the services you rendered to my country, South Africa,during the current years war against the white farmers. During one of my official trips with my South African colleagues to discuss possible acquisitions of land in other outlying country, we came to South Africa where we stayed for a month. From the start, the situation on the ground was extremely tense and tense all round. The government had successfully launched an investigation and massive seizures of land had been made by the end of the month. During our stay in South Africa, my South African colleagues and I happened to pass by a farm belonging to one of the top white farmers, and we learned that he had been liquidated in March 3, 2002. The information we gathered from him was that he was forced to sell his land for some percentage of the total land he owned, and he deposited $US20.m (Twenty Million United States Dollars only) with a South African company. Upon this discovery, I now decided to liquidate the land in question and make way for my own legitimate business interests, to the very end of his land. I need a reliable foreigner who will assist me in this transaction, as the South African law enforcement cannot completely investigate the entire portfolio since all the files pertaining to the account will be with me. You will be paid 5% of the total money, while the remaining 90% will be for me. The transaction has to be concluded before the end of 2003. If you are interested, please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers and your private mailing address, and you will be given the opportunity to negotiate your mode of delivery. Please, note that you will be allowed to request expedited action on your part depending on the complexity of your transaction and the speed with which you desire it. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. Yours faithfully, Dr. John Tavenant.

 FROM DR.RACHID RACHID EZE FROM DR. RACHID EZE BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. Email:  rachid_rituale@yahoo.com Dear, I wish to introduce myself. My name is DR. RACHID RACHID EZE the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICA. I must not delay to inform you of my purpose of contacted you for this business. I have an urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you. On october 21, 1998, an American Oil  Contractor with the Government Code Development and Production Company in Cotonou, Benin, Mr . Fredy H. Thompson made a numbered time (Fixed deposit)  for 36 calendar months, valued at US$36,000,000.00(Thirty four million United States Dollars only) and made  a  second  fixed deposit for the same amount of time for a total sum of US$36,000,000.00(Forty six million United States Dollars only) made out to our bank but stay in our custody. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him but finally Mr. Fredy H. Thompson died in the year 2002 and since then nobody has done anything as he supposed to the money because our foreign remittance contract with the Government has ended. And our foreign partner in the contract with the Government code Development and Production Company has expired. Also in 2002 our bank manager Mr.  Rodolfo Garcia died and since then nobody has done anything as he supposed to his legacy either in his bank or the company. And my husband who is the Chairman of the board of directors of our bank also passed away. And no body has come forward to say that he was in possession of the money or that he knows anything about the money. It may interest you to know that my husband was diagnosed with esophageal cancer some months ago and it is very probable that he will not last for the next three months. And it is because of the seriousness of his disease that he was given the choice to receive medical care outside the country or to close down his bank here in Benin due to safety and security reasons. I got your contact through a travel agent who operates in Africa and I also recommend to you to keep this business proposal very confidential and directed only to a trusted department of our bank. I will also like to assure you that it is absolutely risk free. I will provide all necessary information needed to complete the transaction. Please keep this proposal very confidential and directed only to a trusted and reliable person who you can trust with this important and confidential business proposal. There is absolutely no risk involved in the transaction. I have all the necessary legal documents that will protect you from any breach of the law. Kindly send your reply by e-mail to my private email:  rachidrituale@yahoo.com your response should be in the mail box below. I will happily consider your proposal on your interest.

Therefore, in order for us to have the revenue and the funds to run the consignment we needa foreigner as our customer.

In view of the above, I decided to contact you for the purpose of this transaction.

As accountant to my late boss, he had the sum of $15.5 million USD(U.S.$19.5million) with international and local banks throughout the world. He deposited the money in one of the international and local banks as in his last will. Before his death on the 11th of September 2001,my boss saw this money in a bank as it was deposited and he was the only one who knew about the deposit.He also told me that he made the deposit with my name and my involvement in the details was enough for me to collect the deposit legally. And since then I have been the only one who knows of the deposit since then. I need a foreigner to stand as the beneficiary of the deposit so that I can present you as the next of kin to my late boss. I will tell you more about the reasons for this later.

Title: NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY I am Mr. Joseph.Dillon, the Auditor General of Securitas Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and confidential transaction in my bank. In my new office I discovered a floating fund (US$12.5M in two trunk boxes) which have been there since 1st of January 2002.the boxes belong to former Director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) MR. H.H. Smith who was on death sentence. I have managed to get information from the archives and lawyer that he was in the process of being declared mentally unstable. before his death, Mr. Smith deposited the sum of $12.5M in a Security Company in Cotonou Benin, North African. before the death of his client Mr. Smith deposited the sum of $12.5M in the same company. Presently, the interest of the money in the trunk boxes is with the company. as a matter of fact, the company has plans to seize this money and distribute it among themselves. Further investigation led me to the fact that the deceased deposited his money in two different security companies in Nigeria. Mr. Smith's companies are: South African-West Africa, and Russia-U.S.A. and this changed my crucial information on the subject to his attorney. I must be honest and straight to you, I have all the documents that substantiate (THE SOVIET CIVIL SERVICE) that he deposited the money in two different security companies in two different continents. That makes me the only one who has the information. The reason why I need your urgent and confidential assistance is because I am about to move an enormous sum of money in the file which is still pending finalization. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down. with my position as the Auditor General, where is the money at?-US$12.5million dollars . The security company in Cotonou Benin, North Africa, where he deposited the money, with an office which I will disclose to you when I am convinced you are interested. I want you to know that my office is never, ever breached and the files are not contested. NO person in my office has ever come close to affecting the outcome of this transaction, and neither will I ever. with the grave level of professionalism with which I conducted my business dealings, I held my own in securing the documents and documentation which are with me now. I would have gone about my normal day to make amends for the damage which has been caused by my client. However, due to the sensitive nature of this transaction,the chances of my involvement being detected are very slim. Even if you are not familiar with the various scandals and controversies within the Nigerian legal system, you might want to have a basic knowledge of history and current affairs in Nigeria and abroad. My client is a civil servant by profession and he assumed office as the director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on May 1, 2002. He was on trial for bribery and other high-profile corruption offences. The case got a lot of international media coverage and he was eventually convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. However, the sentence was upheld by the Constitutional Court which affirmed the trial court that the contract awarded was void. This was a decision which my client promulgated himself and was based on constitutional law. He also gave instructions to his assistant in the ministry of defence to carry out the transfer of the money to their respective country. My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the beneficiary of the $12.5million dollars by way of a counter claim on behalf of my client. The reason why I need your urgent and confidential assistance is because I will be in the country to take part in the transfer process. I will be in charge of all legalities and I shall be making sure that all documents backing up the funds are in order. I want to assure you that you will be safe and secure as long as you keep the transaction secret and only reveal it to me after the transfer is concluded. The transfer will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, and my position as the Auditor General of Securitas Bank of Nigeria guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you do confirm the transfer, I shall give you 25% of the total sum while the remaining 75% will be for my family members and I. I wait to hear from you. God bless you and God bless your family. Please treat with utmost confidentiality. Yours faithfully, Joseph Dillon, Auditor General, Securitas Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch.

Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY 
 TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY  Dear Sir/Madam,  REQUEST FOR YOUR URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL I am Mr.Henry Smith an attorney to MOHAMED ABACHA, A FOREIGNER FROM MACAU. I work with a reputable client(s) in the tax law and in the Federal Government of Malaysia. One of these clients is the former Prime Minister of Myanmar R. M. Y. who is presently residing in Hong Kong, where he declared bankruptcy and is on the verge of being liquidated by the Hong Kong Government. You shall read more about the recent political turmoil in Myanmar by visiting this website: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/273907.stm Since the enactment by the Hong Kong Government of SIX MONTHS (2009-2010) of the Fiscal Year 2004/2005/2006, all cash deposits made before this time, as well as all bank accounts opened after this time, of over US$10.5 million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars only) has been confiscated by the Hong Kong Government. The total sum, which consists of cash deposits of $10.5 million, bank account, and over-invoiced property, now totals US$12.5 million. Before the confiscation of this sum, I managed the Accounts department of a bank here in Hong Kong. During the administrations of former Prime Minister Yau Wai-cheung, the ownership of these properties (see table below )were registered to his Attorney Mr. Henry Smith. The Attorney also advised me on how to protect my client's interest from unwarranted confiscation. Before the current government took over office in Hong Kong, they confiscated the accounts of some top military and government officials for their alleged involvement in politics. While I was on the investigation into the ownership of these properties by some top officials, I uncovered an account that belongs to one of them. The account name is titled: MR. ALFIE BELLO (FOR THE FAMILY ONLY). He made a fixed deposit for 18 months, maturity 31 October 2003 , with a value of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars Only) on September 6, 2003. Upon maturity in June 2007 the account was cancelled and all funds in the account destroyed. Since then I have made several inquiries to the Federal Government of Malaysia to recover the money in this account, but all efforts have proved abortive. Currently there is no next of kin to the late Prime Minister Yau. There is also no one to claim the funds from the bank where the account was lodged. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to contact you and seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$15.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 70% to me and 30% to you, while 10% should be for any expenses we incur during the process of this transaction. That being said, if you are interested in participating in this transaction, your contact information, telephone, and fax numbers are required. My partner in this transaction is Mr. Henry Smith of the law firm, MOHAMED ABACHA'S. He is presently in Hong Kong and has decided to visit you in a few days time for more explanations. Please contact me urgently via my email address above to enable us discuss further. Please also note that the transaction is 100% legal and 100% risk-free. Yours sincerely, Mr.Henry Smith. __________________________________________________________________ Get $50 off your first order with promo code MARILYN1030 at code.free.com http://www.pharmacy.com/promo/marily/

Title: PROPOSAL
 PROPOSAL Attn: Sir/Madam, I am Mr. John C. Thompson a citizen of Szechuan province in China. I worked with the State owned China Steel Corp for about four years. I successfully lobbied the board of directors to approve my pay package as the company's third division manager. I successfully lobbied the board to approve my package worth $5.5million United States dollars in cash in exchange for us to move production of certain high grade steel products out of China for further investment in the USA. The consolidated purchases amounted to $15million United States dollars. I was able to secure the services of two Asian private investigators who also worked for China Steel Corp. to assist us in this transaction. The Chinese authorities have been extremely strict in their investigations into foreign contractorship. It is difficult for me to operate a foreign account in China because of the fact that I have no family or relation here. I have therefore chosen to provide an account in one of the leading security company in Asia which I can transfer the sum of $15million dollars to at will. I will also like you to provide your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications as needed. I need a reliable foreign partner to help me.

 TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT REPLY NEEDED MR.JAMES HUBA DE KARASSA DE KARASI BANK (KRK) OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA. PHONE: 00226-807-332980 FAX: 00226-807-332980 FAX: FAX: EMAIL:james@krow.net PHONE: 00226-807-332980 TEL: 234-27-828-9144 Dear Sir/Madam,               DEAR SIR/ MAMY,                   CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL I am Professor James Hikawa, the head of credit evaluation department of Nakamu Darussalam Bank of Nigeria,I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $7,000,000 USD in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife and their only daughter during a tour of Egypt in August 2000.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his wife and only daughter) were both killed during the tour and nobody or person understood that they were not the next of kin to the deceased. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody or person is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines of our bank stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is necessary because our customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to our bank. We agree that 15% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, while 75% will be for me and my colleagues.We will visit your country at the conclusion of this transaction to claim our share due to the rules of our bank, we have all agreed on a percentage of 15% but we will need a little more details to make sure there is no misunderstanding. Please, return my mail to:james@krow.net or my private mail box:james@krow.net and include your phone and fax numbers for easy communication during the business. You can also contact me via my mailbox:james@krow.net Thanking you for your anticipated acceptance while we look forward to your soonest response through your private email address. Regards and God Bless, Professor James Hikawa. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

Title: URGENT REPLY NEEDED.
 URGENT REPLY NEEDED. Dear Sir, I wish to employ you in a transaction that is going to be of mutual benefit to both of us. I am  Mrs Isaaka  KHALA the only daughter of late Chief  Iblan Ibrahim KHALA from Lagos who was the former military head of state of Nigeria. I have the sum of $5.5million (Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in my account with a security and money transfer company here in Abuja . I have been confined only to my room and all my calls are monitored. I decided to contact you as a foreigner because this sum of $5.5million dollars does not belong to me, but to some body else, and I am sure that whoever it is will be of help to me. My late father while in the habit of keeping a large sum of money in a security company here in Lagos kept a total sum of $15million United States Dollars only in a security company in Cotonou Benin. My mother died two years ago and took with me the dreams of having a child. My father before his death was of the opinion that I should have the money with me wherever I went, and that no foreigner would ever know of this account. Before the death of my father on February 14, 2003 he deposited the money in a security company here in Lagos and it is only me that has access to the documents that prove that he deposited the money in this account. According to Nigerian law, the money is the property of the government and I am the only son of my father. I am requesting for your assistance to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since no one else should know of this account. As soon as I get your interest, we shall discuss on what percentage of our share we want to share. I need your full name and address. Tel/Fax numbers where you can be reached. I will provide all necessary information to enable you understand everything that will make up this transaction. Please this transaction is 100% risk free. As soon as this transaction is concluded, you will be given the chance to negotiate your mode of share depending on your choice. Please I would like you see to it that you keep this transaction secret for security reasons. Your contact numbers will be used to call for further information and the details of the deposit will be sent to you. Please also keep this transaction confidential for security reasons. Please contact me as soon as you receive this letter. Yours Faithfully, Mrs Isaaka  KHALA.

 GOOD DAY DEAR FRIEND, I WOULD PLEAD THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS CONFIDENTIAL. I AM, IMMEDIATELY, TRANSFERING THE LEFT OVER FUNDS (USD10.5 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS) OF MY BANK. HOWEVER, I HAVE DECIDED TO AVERT THE TRANSFER BECAUSE THE NEW DIRECTORS WERETILL ARRIVE THE BANK AND MANDATED THAT THE FUNDS BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER BANKS. THE PROVISION OF FOREIGN ACCOUNTS WAS FORCED BY THE OFFICE PRESIDENT AND COUPLED BY THE COUPLED REGENTS. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE TRANSFERED WAS (USD10.5 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS). THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN ACCOUNTS TO BE USED FOR THE TRANSFER WAS (USD10.5 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS). BECAUSE, THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO BE TRANSFERED IS (USD10.5 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST, I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD MAKE ARRANGMENT FOR THE FIRST TRIAL OF THE MONEY BEFORE THE FIRST DIRECTORS ARRIVED, SINCE PRESIDENT DONOVANI MALIKI WERE COUPLED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS AWAITING THE NEXT OF KIN TO APPROVE THE MONEY TO HIS BANK. AND I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THE BANK AS A CIVIL SERVANT, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNTS AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THE BANK, THIS AMOUNT WILL BE OUR ONLY FINANCIAL BENEFIT DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER. I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE FUND TRANSFER DURING SEASON. I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS DEAL IS 100% RISK FREE, ON THE MORES THAT THE BANK DOES NOT EXPECT THE PAYMENT, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS YOU INVOLVE. I OFFER NO OTHER BENEFICIARY,BECAUSE I CANNOT INVEST THE SUM OF (USD10.5 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS INTO OTHER BANK ACCOUNTS,YOU CAN ONLY INTRODUCE ME AS THE GUARDIAN OF THIS CIVIL SERVICE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE BUSINESS WORKS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS. PLEASE, DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME SO THAT WE WILL SEND YOU THE NECESSARY DETAILS. PLEASE, YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS CONFIDENTIAL, BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THIS BUSINESS IS TRYING TO HAPPEN. YOU SHOULD SEEK THE URGENT NEED FOR IT, BECAUSE THE IMAGE OF THE BUSINESS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER.

I'VE BEEN EXPECTING THE SEXUAL ASYLUM CAMP HERE IN COTE D"IVOIRE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, HOPING THAT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS TRANSFER MIGHT BE A PROMPT EVENT BECAUSE OF THE RATIO OF POWER WHICH THE CROWN EXECUTED. DUE TO THIS RATIO, THE SEXUAL ASYLUM CAMP HERE IN COTE D"IVOIRE WOULD BE APPROVED CLEARLY WITHOUT ANY DUE PERMIT, COMPENSATION OR DISBURSEMENT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS BUSINESS, BECAUSE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF WORKERS ARE ALSO NUMBER(3) OF(14) OF THE DESIGNATED NUMBER WHICH WE INTEND TO BUILD PROFITABLE BUSINESS WITH THE OIL COMPANY ON THIS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND RISKFREE TRANSFER. HOWEVER, WE REQUIRE YOU TO KINDLY INDICATE YOUR MIND AND BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY, BECAUSE OUR DESTINATION HERE IN COTE D"IVOIRE IS AT WAR. I WILL SECURE THE FUND AND DELIVER IT TO YOU ON YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER BEFORE WE START WORK.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER SIX YEARS, THE FUND WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY I am the manager of big and small businesses here in Nigeria and also an attorney – so that is where I come in contact with you. I was the personal attorney to late Mr. John Peta who was the Manager of Peta Oil Company in Nigeria. Mr. Peta was the ex-owner of the following companies: Chairman CEO: Peta Oil Company of Nigeria. Chairman CEO: Niger Khodorkovsky (the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies): Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Most Largest Oil Company) Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial institution with its branches all over the world). SOURCE OF FUNDS: I have a profiling amount in an excess of $9M (Nine Million U.S. Dollars). The sum of $10.4million have been placed under dormant/unserviceable account for a period of 5 years which is being rolled over with the interest. The reason for the interest is that the government is ready to approve this fund into the account of an An Irish citizen and also claim the funds for Uncle Sam, who is currently on vacation in Italy, and hence need some way of transfering this money out of the country. The problem is that the owner of the account is dead and nobody knows about the funds except me and the attorney who is presently appointed to the account as the next of kin/beneficiary. I know that this may come to you as a surprise, but be informed that I have been advised by my client that this type of transaction is not safe. The main reason is that the funds are deposits and the real owner of the account is dead, and the only person that may know about the content of the account is my client and I, therefore I need your full cooperation to help me in claiming this money off the shelf into your account as the beneficiary/next of kin/beneficiary so that the funds can be transfer into your account as "uncle" and claim the interest of the funds on your behalf. You will be paid the stated amount stated herein after due processes have been followed. Once this fund is claimed and transferred into your account, I shall require your full name and address to enable me pin point your address so that the attorney can use your private phone or fax number or email address to contact you for further details and the process of the claim. Whatever is the case, be informed that this transaction is 100% risk free. You will be paid according to the percentage indicated below: 1. 20% of the sum would be for you as the supplier, while the remaining 40% will be for me. 2. 65% would be for me while the remaining 5% would be for tax as your government may require.       It is necessary to inform you that if your government requires your assistance, you shall provide the necessary paperwork and documents that will enable the move of this money from the above to your account, for us to share in the remaining 5%. You shall also send to me your business card, which shall enable the attorney to pin it to your business. I shall also send to you the completed application form that will enable the attorney to start the claim.

 Uphill From Mr. Charles Charles Charles. Dear Sir,  RE: URGENT MUTUAL PROJECT PROPOSAL.   I am Mr. Charles Charles Charles Sir, the attorney to late Mr. Bernard Tapie a national of your country. Please refer to this web site for more information about the unfortunate incident of my client.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm On 30th of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu (Aviagugu) Lagos-Nigeria express road. Unfortunately for my client and his family members, they all lost their lives in this unfortunate incident.After the unfortunate incident, my lawyer contacted me on his way to the scene to seek for the recovery of some of the money he deposited in a security company in Lagos-Nigeria. I advised him on various ways that the money he deposited in the company may be recovered but the way he instructed was the only way. He has arrangements in place to claim the funds if necessary, but he has inform me that the way things are now may be enough to convince him that it is more profitable to leave the money in the company and go abroad where it will be safer from prying eyes and hands (the money might be better secured in a security company to avoid being traced). To this end I have informed him that if he is not interested he can have the money released to him at the end of the year 2002.I have also informed him that I will present him to the company as the beneficiary to the funds. He must however, give me his contact and address where he can be contacted  immediately after the funds are released to him. I expect him to furnish me with his Full Names and Tel/Fax Numbers as soon as I hear from him. I will use this opportunity to get back to you the particulars in line with section 25 of the Investment Guidance Document. Please, your urgent response is required.

Title:

Menaduharim. Menaduharim, This is Mr. Viscount Bryn Renfrew, a Royalist from United Kingdom, and the Manager of Petro chemical Services. I have an extremely confidential business proposition for you. As you are probably aware of the current situation in the world affairs and prevailing political climate. This situation has brought about large-scale political unrest in many parts of the world. Ours is no exception. As you may well know, the British Petroleum Corporation (BPCC) made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,2006/09/20 through a bank here in United Kingdom. Upon maturity several notice was sent to the bank. Again after this period of 2 years another notice was sent and still no response came from the bank. We suspect that the government agencies responsible for the pressure from the international community to freeze all the accounts in the bank as war criminals are hindering the process of getting the accounts finally closed down. Since then the bank has actively lobbied the international community to freeze all the accounts in the bank as well. It is this lobbying that brought about the recent suspension of the fixed deposit agreement between us. The economic sanctions against Iraq have made it impossible for us to run this bank here in United Kingdom. With the limited amount of funds left over after paying all the accrued interest at the end of each year, I have the option of transferring this money into any reliable account in the world. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here in United Kingdom. And beyond the remittance of such money the account owner shall continue to be paid upon his/her acceptance of the deposit as the note indicates. I will apply for Safekeeping pursuant to the procedures set forth in the agreement. Please note that you are not required to reply at this point in time. The more formal communication is required the more reason to reach you. And feel free to send a copy of your current bank information along with your contact address to enable us discuss further.       You may also want to consider that you will be entitled to 20% of any remuneration you would have been on the receiving end of this year as a result of the above mentioned negotiation tactics. By the way, you should view this from another angle. If you are familiar with the oil business the ratio of oil to foreign currency in circulation on December 31st 2001 was US$1.303 to one hundred percent foreign currency. Therefore at the end of each year, you are entitled to 10% of the above stated sum. However, if you do not accept my offer of a fixed deposit with us, you shall have 15% of the above stated sum and 60% shall be for me. Upon your receipt of your response you shall be notified of the next line of action. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. You can send your reply by email to me at viscount_bryn@yahoo.com      Please also note that you should contact me as soon as you receive this mail.       Yours faithfully,    Viscount Bryn Renfrew _________________________________________________________________ Don't just search. Find.

Title: Please help me.  (From: Gervaiz Hasan) (From:Gervaiz Hasan) Dear Friend,  Please I am Mr. Gervaiz Hasan the manager of VICTOR BANK LTD in NIGERIA. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On october 4, 2003, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Paul Sarandif made a numbered time (Fixed) order for 32,000 barrels of petroleum products (Petroleum Products) with payment to our bank in Abuja, Nigeria. On our return trip through the national port of Abidjan the following day, we passed a small container of Petroleum Products. Upon closer inspection, we found that the contents were in actuality, US$16.2M (Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) and it was finally realised to us that Mr. Paul Sarandif did declare some container of $16,000,000 in his official certificate of deposit with our bank in Abidjan,Cote d'Ivoire.  From this, we deduced that he deposited the sum of (US$16.2M) with the National Petroleum Corporation.  And as such we are looking for a reliable and honest person to stand as the beneficiary of the stated amount, so that the National Petroleum Corporation will process the payment to you. We cannot legally do it ourselves because the money is still in our bank custody and can only be paid to our foreign partner.  There is however, an easy and legal way to apply for payment to our foreign partner and partner in the US, who will process the payment to you. Simply send us your private telephone and fax number including any personal details you may require for the transaction. As soon as we receive this information from your side, we will proceed to the next step and also let you know that we are ready to proceed with the transaction.

I wish to solicit your assistance to enable me present you as the next-of-kin to my late client Mr. Daniel Bryan of United States of America. Bryan died with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. For more informations about the crash you can visit this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since then, I have made several inquiries to locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace any of his relation but all was fruitless.After some months, I discovered that Daniel Bryan's supposed next-of-kin(s) has since died along with him. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and present you as the next of Kin of Daniel Bryan. Bryan is dead, and no one will ever come forward to claim his funds of $12.5 million United States Dollars(USD) with BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). Due to the above reasons, we need your assistance to present yourself as the next of kin of Bryan so that the proceeds of his deposit valued at $12,5 million United States Dollars(USD) can be paid to you. We shall employ the service of attorney to draft the will and obtain all necessary documents and letter of administration in your favor for the transfer. You will not be required as the next of kin, all documentations and proofs will be done by me and my colleagues for this Transfers. We want to assure you that this Transaction is 100% risk-free. Finally, we will be compensating you with 20% of the amount at the end of the transaction. Please if you are interested, reply back to my email address for onward communication. Thank you in anticipation of your response. I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THIS TRANSACTION IS HITCH-FREE AND IT IS NOT FAKE.

Title: URGENT REPLY NEEDED
 URGENT REPLY NEEDED Address: PORT KIMBA LAGOS- NIGERIA. E-mail:bagleyjohn@yahoo.com. Personal:bagleyjohn@yahoo.com. DEAR SIR, I AM JOHN BAKER FROM THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. POSITION OF THE BANKER: I am the Manager of Central Bank of Nigeria,  where I operate out of Lagos and Abuja. I have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you. On october 6, 1999, an American Oil  Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation made a fixed deposit for 36 calendar months,  with a value US$36,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million United States Dollars Only) in my branch. Upon maturity in 2002, the next of kin to this  client (the natural next of kin) applied for claims on the funds claiming the funds as next of kin to the late president of the  republic elected in the constitutional amendments. Upon receipt of this notification, the bank immediately contacted me on his behalf, based on the fact that  we share the same surname which is Achmedianzeh, the former president of the republic. In line with the process outlined below, the bank now wants to secure the funds on behalf of the former president  before the constitutional commission orders his release to the government. The process we have going on is that the government has now issued writs of execution to all private and public  firms allowing them to be seized and confiscated. All that is required of you is to furnish us with your particulars as the original from your bank, for us to proceed accordingly. We will submit the funds to your bank as unclaimed funds and all unclaimed funds will be declared unserviceable by the bank. The bank will then confiscate all the money in your account and send it to the government's unclaimed funds department. We shall have 20% of the money (US$36,000,000.00) in our account at the end of the process. What we want to do is make arrangement for the bank to transfer the balance of US$36,000,000.00 straight into your hand in case of any problem during the transfer. We have all the necessary legal documents with which we can secure the funds in the name of our nominee. Upon your positive response, we shall then provide the details and procedures for the transactions. We are aware of the need to have a genuine and top-notch person in the picture at this stage to facilitate the transfer. We shall employ our own percentage for all legal expenses incurred during the transaction. We expect you to believe that this transaction is 100% risk-free. Please, whenever you receive this proposal, do not hesitate to contact us. Please, we may share the money among ourselves if we can, but we want to maintain the modus operandi as outlined herein. For further details regarding this transaction, please contact us. Thank you for your anticipated response, . . . . John Bagley.

Title: URGENT
 URGENT My sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Everyone is aware that property prices go up and value diminishes at the time of buying or selling, and all that is needed is for a little buyer's remorse.  My name is Abraham, the only son of my late father Mr. Joseph Estrada.  I am 21 years old and currently residing in Lagos, Nigeria, with my best friend Mrs. Mary.  My father was the President of government in Nigeria until his arrest and conviction of corruption charges.  He was falsely accused of pocketing some million dollars from a CONTROVERSY deal.  Before his arrest and conviction, he deposited some amount of money with a security firm in Europe.  He has since been released on bail pending when all the investigation is finished.  My mother died when I was just 2 years old, and since then I assumed responsibility for the family.  My father used my position and position of relative to take care of the family since I am still a young girl.  My mother died with my father before he was arrested and convicted.  Before his arrest and conviction, he told my father that he has the sum of $30,000,000.00 ($34,000,000.00 USD) in a security company in Europe. That he wants to use this money for a project.  I am his only son and that is why I need your help.  Note: This transaction is confidential and risk free, and there is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction.  You will be entitled to a percentage of the money as gratification from the security company, while the rest is for me,  which I plan to invest in your country.  Please, you should treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality, because of security and confidentiality reasons, i will provide the necessary documents and proof of transaction as soon as you indicate your interest.        I shall give you the contact address and telephone number for easy communication and you can also reach me on the email address above.

 JOB COMPLIMENT Suleman.njj@light.com  NB:I AM DR.HUDSON YIN THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT OF BANK OF AFRICA(BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO IN BURKINA-FASO IN WEST AFRICA. FIRST, I MUST SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRANSACTION.THIS IS BY  VIRTUE OF ITS NATURE AS BEING UTTERLY CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET.  HOWEVER AFTER SERIES OF PETITION WAS RECIEVED BY THIS PRESENT REGIME FROM FOREIGN CONTRACTORS AND INABILITY OF THE CADILLAC OIL MINISTRY (C.O.M)TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION FOR THE PAYMENT TO ITS FOREIGN CREDITORS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, C.O.M, THEY MANDATED US TO CARRY OUT A CAREFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OVERDUE PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN CONTRACTORS. DURING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCESS, WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF US$30 MILLION DOLLARS. THIS MONEY HAS BEEN IN THE CUSTODY POSSESSION OF A SECURITY AND FINANCE COMPANY FOR FOREIGN PARTIES FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE SOURCES OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE ACCESSED THE MONEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: INDICATING THEIR GROUNDS OF THE OVERDUE PAYMENTS IN THE AUTHENTICATION DOCUMENTS, AND THEIR DIRECTIVES AS THEY MAY HAVE BEEN FORWARDED TO US. WE HAVE VERIFIED THE ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE WITH OUR BODY WEBSITE AND FOUND OUT THAT THE MONEY IN QUESTION IS NO LONGER POPULAR WITH THE C.O.M AND ARE NOW HAVING ANOTHER REVIEW DURING THE OPENING OF NEW ACCOUNTS BELOW THE ORIGINAL C.O.M. AND WE ARE STILL IN THE CUSTODY POSSESSION OF THE COMPANIES THAT WERE OVERDUE TO US.SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT THESE COMPANIES, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THEIR NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM THE MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE THE MONEY UNLESS SOME BODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES AND LAWS BUT UNFORTUNATELY, DIABOLGED WITH THE GROUP THAT OPPOSED TO THE OVERDUE PAYMENTS.IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN MY  DEPARTMENT NOW DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT-OF-KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND WE DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL. THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER SIX YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND. THE REQUEST OF FOREIGN PARTIES AS NEXT-OF-KIN IN THESE CASES IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE C.O.M. WOULD LIKE TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR PARTICULARS. BASED ON THIS BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING A WAIVER TO ENCOUNTER THE REQUEST OF FOREIGN PARTIES AS SUCH.I'VE INFORMED YOU THAT ALL TEXTUAL AND COMPARATIVE MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT TO EFFECT THE COMPLETE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AS THE BENEFICIARY.AS SOON AS THE FUND REMAINED UNCLAIMED, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED TO YOUR ACCOUNT AS THE ORIGINAL BUISNESS .THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAS BEEN WORKED OUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO SEE YOUR MOST NEEDED ASSISTANCE BEFORE THE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND.I'VE BEEN ADVISING YOU TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH I

Title: URGENT REPLY.
 URGENT REPLY. From:Professor Boonai Boonai University of Pennsylvania, 22 East 52nd Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10022. Attn: The Director of Operations,Please this proposal is not a hoax mail and consider this message serious business. I am Professor Boonai , a staff in the acoustics department of the University of Pennsylvania. I got your contact through a trade journal, and I must admit that I knew very little about you, except that you are a foreigner. I am a lawyer by profession from Singapore, and I practice before the Asian Bar Association (ABA) in New York. I have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On July 6, 2000, an American Embassy official with the Consulate General in Singapore sent a routine notification to all Embassy employees, which I sent to your name as the only beneficiary. Unfortunately, all the notification was ignored by me, and I got a reminder from the American Embassy in Singapore that you were supposed to respond to the notification. I finally realized it was because I did not declare any next of kin or relations in all my official documents, including my banking documents with the Bank of Singapore. This sum of USD$8.5 million (Eight million five hundred thousand United States Dollars only) is still with the Department of State and is awaiting my claim. According to Federal Law of the country Singapore,under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1977,to run out the fund must be declared to the Federal Government. Although, I have proof that all the documentations of transaction were properly filed and approved by the Government, but I do not know to what extent the two is concerned. My proposal is that I shall like you to stand as the beneficiary of this fund and stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Wilson,the American Embassy Official in Singapore. He made an appointment for us to discuss terms on a coming-over period of seven years, but due to circumstances beyond our control he was forced to retire from service. However, you are allowed to negotiate for your share of the fund at the end of the period. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall provide you with the details and the application procedures. I look forward to a long and healthy partnership with you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction will be most profitable for both of us. Please kindly provide your confidential telephone and fax numbers for faster communication. Yours Sincerely, Professor Boonai Boonai ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

The sources of your concern and the manner in which the transaction should be handled in my department as a matter of fact. I will like you to observe utmost confidentiality on this matter. My name is Paul Dickson the auditor of public accounts department of Benin Government. In my department there is an old account with a value of Twenty one million five hundred thousand United State Dollars only.

The information regarding the above account was given to me by an ex-contractor who worked with my department for a period of seven years after my promotion to the position of Director of Public Accounts, in April, 2003. He told me that the owner of the account, a foreigner by name Mr. Fred yakubu Amend, made a fixed deposit for twenty three calendar months, with a value of US$23,000,000.00 (Twenty Three Million United States Dollars only) in one account that belongs to him, this account is a secret compartment of his personal funds which he kept in a financial institution in Europe. During the course of the investigation we discovered that Mr. Fred yakubu Amend died since not more than a few months, possibly less.We also discovered that his next of kin, also died with him.I am contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to transfer the sum of US$23 Million from Benin Government into a safe account in your country. We have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum for your assistance. More so, you will give us your honest assistance to transfer this sum, you are entitled to a percentage of the total sum depending on the type of sum you transfer.
