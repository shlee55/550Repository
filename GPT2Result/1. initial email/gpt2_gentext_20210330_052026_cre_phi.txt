As the head of bill and exchange, it is my duty as a government official to  report all unclaimed money to our bank so that the fund  will be released to the government treasury as unclaimed fund.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.

– The jury at the murder trial of late General Sani Abacha found him not guilty after all legal procedures were concluded and no further evidence was adduced which proved his guilt, This verdict was based on an oversimplified and illegally obtained law enforcement procedure that was found to be unconstitutional and utterly contrary to principles of justice.The above named General Sani Abacha was the chief war profiteer in our country during the regime of Laurent Gbagbo, a secular, pro-presidential president who died on the 21st January 2003.  This judgment is a huge embarrassment to my family and I swear by the Lord that I will not rest until the death of this wicked and arrogant General is confirmed and that he is no longer a threat to my family. I have decided to seek for a Christian person or company who will be capable and willing to assist me in this transaction. I will furnish you with my details and the documents which will enable us carry out the transfer. The transactions can be concluded within 3 weeks with the payment of the required percentage of the amount needed to transfer to your account.  I do want to emphasize that the money is coming from a gold and diamond mine in Nigeria which my late father set aside for his family as soon as he realized the benefits it will bring to both of us. There is no risk involved in this transaction. It is a no risk transaction.  As soon as you respond to this letter, I will send you the basic details and the legal information which will help you understand that this is not a joke and that we need you to assist us. 1. YOUR FULL NAMES. 2. YOUR ADDRESSES. 3. YOUR PHYSICAL AND TRANSFER DETAILS. Thank you. God bless you as you respond. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Maryam Abacha.

: Special treatment accorded to Frank Nkomo (JUNIOR) because of his influential position in government circles and the highly placed officials are in a constant state of change of power and favouritism towards me because of the functions I perform for the government. This is the reasoning behind the need for a foreign partner to carry out the successful transfer of the fund to a foreign account and he will continue the share of the fund having agreed to let me amass 20% and 5% respectively. The balance will be for any expenditure we make during the transfer period. If you are interested in applying for the transfer as a result of the above, kindly get back to me. I need your assistance in receiving the above-stated amount which will justify the transfer to your account. If you are not interested, let me know and let me assume no risk of any kind.

====================
A Palestinian (Mohammed Abed) was involved in the March 15, 2004, three-and-a-half million dollar deal for the Mideast in Dubai  that resulted in the loss of the life of one of my client (Marc Rich). He was also the victim to his own people (the  Saudis) infact killing him.  As it is a settled fact that as time goes on, the money (US$ 3,500,000.00) accumulated by the Saudis in the name of my client (Marc Rich) will be paid back to the Arab Government for the sum of US$ 18,500,000.00 (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is why I am begging for your assistance in the following ways:   (1)To provide a bank account through which this money (US$ 3,500,000.00) would be transferred to your account.    (2)To serve as the guardian of this fund since I am a boy of 28yrs and I need a strong and reliable person to assist me in his/her strong and dependable manner. But first I want you to give me some time to exchange some salary into your account.                                        All the agencies that will be used in this transaction have agreed to offer you a very good percentage of the total sum.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 4, 2000, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek,                                                                        
====================
Ahead of the January transfer deadlines, it is my request to invite you to be my partner and partner in transfer. During the transfer process, all the documents and information relating to the account will be sent to you, I will use my position and influence to obtain all the required approvals and letter of probate to the account holder, which will enable the fund to be released to your account from the Bank in your name. The account holder as beneficiary will be entitled to 25% of the total amount, 70% will be for me, while 5% is for expenses both parties might have incurred during the transfer process. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction, which will give you a good idea of how we can proceed. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest. I am ready to give you more details about myself. I am Mr. Alfred Johan Ambe , the manager of bills and foreign remittances at the prime bank in South Africa. During the course of our auditing last week, I discovered a dormant account with a balance of US$14,000, 000 (Fourteen Million US dollars), which expired in 2000 but was claimed by the bank by this name in 2002. After going through some old files in the records, it was discovered that the account holder has died, and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after which the account was declared Non-Admittance. The account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the account holder. I am contacting you at this moment to seek your help to transfer this money to a foreign account because the former account holder is a foreigner and my colleague in the bank cannot transfer the money to a foreign account. The bank officials are assuring me that the bank will release the money to you as the beneficiary, but I want you to know that the bank is ready to do back transfer of the money to an account of your choice where the fund will be safe, since nobody is coming forward to claim the fund. I am willing to give you a reasonable percentage of the money for your effort /input after the transfer. You can indicate your own level of interest by giving me your telephone number. As soon as I get your phone number I will give you a good description of the account and the transaction. I will also enable you set-up a "package deal" with the bank officials who is going to help you. If you are not interested, please do not let me out to the press, because I will not let you go until you are interested. I will also use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your prompt response and to working with you. Thank you and God bless you. Yours Truly, MR. ALFRED HON. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

====================
A little while ago, I came across your company profile and decided to solicit your co-operation. This is by virtue of the fact that my position in the Government does not allow me to have many expensive overseas investments. I have therefore decided to solicit for your assistance in the amount of Thirty Million United States Dollars ($30,000,000.00 USD). This money is my compensation for my services rendered in the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, where I work as the department head. I have carefully collected all the relevant documents that will facilitate our putting you forward as a next of kin to the late Mr. Fredrick. It may also interest you to note that a visa was granted to my late colleague, Mr. Fredrick, upon his nomination by me. If you accept this offer, we will both work together as a department head to seek your assistance. Note that this is not a case of money laundering. The deceased Fredrick was a man of very little means and had no son. What we need is for you to assist us in accumulating money that will be used in investing the money in your country. I have already mapped out 20% of this money for you as a commission, while 5% will be set aside to take care of any expences we make in the future investment abroad. Please, all I want you to do is to assist me in finding a good bank account abroad where we can transfer this money and also to assist me in investing it properly. Note that this arrangement is 100% risk free, as all the funds will be transacted by me and my colleague. Note also that this money is not traceable and can only be traced to your account. The transaction is expected to be concluded within the next few working days. I look forward to your earliest reply. Thanks. Best regards, Dr.Bello Zungu.

This comes after a massive hack that hit the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources , and Fisheries, where over $11 billion dollars worth of gold and jewellery belonging to some of the premier clients was kept. The clients were involved in a gold and diamond transaction. During the course of the gold and diamond transaction, their bank transferred some of this money into a foreign account out west. This money was taken as investment, and the clients were not aware of the money in the account since no one has come forward to claim it. The clients are believed to have lost their money when the Fed Ex Express Express they were using in their dealings with the officials before and during the gold and diamond transaction was shot down by the authorities of Zimbabwe and we regret to say that the money is still sitting in this account and no one will ever come forward to claim it. As a result of this we are and are seeking for a foreign partner that can assist us to transfer the money into your country or any reliable account outside our country for a possible share of the money which we expect to be shared in the ratio of 60% for us and 40% for your country. We are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and contribution to the success of the transaction, 10% will be for all kinds of expenses that are absolutely necessary during the entire process of transferring the money, such as phone bills, transportation, such as flights, lodging, etc.Please your assistance is needed to make this transaction work because we can not carry on our present business as a result of the current situation we find ourselves in. We are ready to go back to your country for splitting the money according to the percentages indicated. If you are interested in assisting us, please get back to me immediatly via email address or phone number above. You will also need your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Upon receipt of your reply,I will send to you the application form which you will complete and forward to the bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the beneficiary to our old account. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Please DO NOT entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

We are always on the lookout for new sources of income that would help us shoulder more of a burden off the actual donors. We are currently in need of a foreign partner with whom we can carry out a successful business deal. With the assistance of a foreign partner, we could secure a deal for the payment of an overdue bill and it could also serve as a model to other foreign partners who would be interested in doing business with. The due amount for the overdue bill is US$11,400,000.00 (Eleven Million United States Dollars), which we are presently waiting for a response from any of the foreign partners, with due importance given to the timing of our due payment. The  amount involved is (US$11,400,000.00) eleven  million united state dollars. I am just trying to get your acknowledgment as soon as possible.  The purpose of this letter is to seek your co-operation and assistance in supporting us in the transaction.  It would also serve as a reminder for us to look for a partner that will assist us in the transaction and also help us recoup some of the money which has been lost.

prepared by the Presidential Palace Press Office. The following budgetary statement was prepared by the Presidential Palace Press Office.                            This budget is being paid by the hope and trust of the people assembled here who have risen up and are now making demands for the release of political prisoners which the last President had humiliated them by not allowing them to repatriate any of their money plus they have threatened not to release any of their top officials who have been imprisoned for life for the same offence.                                   These people are the Americans who have been using the name Jesus of Nazareth (God's Son) as their leader, but this has not worked out for them as he has imprisoned everyone around him.                                     The present regime is prepared to release any political suspect or traitor who has spent the past 15 years in prison for a crime he did not commit and he has even pardoned some criminals  who were convicted of a crime but were innocent.                   In order to relieve the pressure on this country by doing away with all forms of stress and strain upon the person, it is my proposal that I personally will like you to present your total assets to the government so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in position to claim all the money when it is released. This will be done in a bank according to agreement between the government and the lawyers and it will be done under a legal name which you will provide. I have decided to give you 20% of the total amount.5% will be for any expenses which you will make while the remaining of the 80% will be for me. There is no risk involved in this transaction and it will be done under the best of circumstances. I am at ease and content knowing that I have made this contract with you. I look forward to working with you and I hope to be able to hear from you soon. Thanks and God bless as I wait for your response. Yours truly, Barbara Kone. Note: Please, keep the integrity of the project and the transaction as top secret as possible. I have screenshots to prove your authenticity. From your message and profile, i can confirm that you are a good and trustworthy person. Thank you. Yours sincerely. Barbara Kone.

BOSTON -- The owner of a U.S.-based real estate company, Hasim B. Malik, has been killed in a ghastly auto-accident here in the United Kingdom. He was involved in a scheme to take £3.5million of my father's account in a bank here in the U.K. which my mother had discovered and reported to the police.   This occurred when he was still in office as the head of state, and she tried to put an end to it. She was told that it was against this background that she had advised (to sell)  the money to foreign partners. This came when the young (PM) was about to go on a one-day visit to the U.K. and was the reason why I decided to contact you.  The money had been deposited in a concealed Security Company  here in the U.K. which is why I contacted you to help secure this money  into a Foreign Account. The money is kept in a Security Company here in the U.K. and my father's bank account is one of the funds which had been deposited to his account, The Security Company is one of the many accounts which he had opened with the bank in developing countries globally and one of the reasons why he had asked me to find a trustworthy partner to  work with to secure this money in a Foreign Account. This transaction will be completed within a year. Until the money is transferred into a foreign account, my father had also deposited a further £2.5million of his  total $21,000,000 in a bank here in the U.K.  This money had been planned for the purchase of houses and  cement production in Africa with his whole family. This money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the factories and also for home renovations which my mother had already begun. Meanwhile, we have agreed to share the money 30:40:50 in your account. This share will be yours if you do not accept to work with my family. I will investigate further to see if you can assist us and also to see if you can help my mother to clear this money correctly. But if you cannot do it, I will consult a trusted confidant who will help us look for another foreign partner who will assist us to transfer the money into a foreign account with an account which is not known by either of us and also help us invest it wisely in a profitable venture. This is only a cover story and all agreements have been concluded.  Please clear this through my email address:mabriand@hotmail.com and also my phone:+44704010788  Thank you and God bless. Please your mother is most certainly in the best of condition as they have had to put her on ventilator for the last couple of weeks because of her failing health. Your earliest response to this letter is needed. Yours truly, MABRIAND JEFFERSON JOHNSON. NB: THIS LETTER CAN BE EXPLAINED TO YOU WITHIN THE TEXT BELOW. Yours Truly,  MR MABRIAND JEFFERSON JOHNSON

"We are currently in need of a self-employed person who will help us receive the funds that were generated by the Government from the sale of government bonds which we have been reimbursing the Indian Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Monetary Authority of Nigeria for the past six years, all the while hoping that the then President of Nigeria would step down and allow the funds to be paid to our self-appointed Treasurer who will in turn direct the funds to our respective bank accounts and companies, but unfortunately we learnt that after the death of the President of Nigeria, his body was moved and deposited in a private security company, leaving no survivor. Our present method of doing business is to transfer the funds to a foreign account, but we now know that the amount of the fund is not money, but rather we owe the money to a foreign security company that has since been paid for, so the funds can only be transferred to a foreign account to be determined. The Funds in question are the sum of  US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty million Dollars),  20% is for us, while 50% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred in the meanwhile, as expenses both of us might have incurred. We have agreed that if you are willing to assist us, you will be entitled to 25% of the total amount, 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses both of us might incur during the transfer, and 60% would be for myself and my family to come over to your country to invest in your country. All other necessary expenses both parties might incur during the transfer is not covered.

So the Guardian Trust Bank has issued me a notice to provide necessary information or be declared bankrupt. My worry is not my bank's name. I have heard that some people in power have secretly protected the bank from the outside world. I am just an ordinary person who wants to do honest business with other people. I am also independent minded. I do not want to be tied down to any fixed account or any arrangement. If you are honest I will trust you to send me your information: 1. Your full name and address. 2. Your private phone and fax numbers. 3. Your Bank name, Union Bank number and Bank Account number. 4. Your Bank Account balance, the total amount and the type of account. It is not necessary to set up a new bank account. It could be a dormant account that belongs to one of the former customers who died interstate. I will also credit your account as a beneficiary of this money from the bank so that you will be able to receive this money. After receiving this information from you, I will send to you the text of the application that will enable you receive this fund. I will be waiting for your reply so that I will discuss further with you on the details. Goodbye. Please you have to give me your email address if I am interested in working with you. Because I want to know if you can help me. I am ready to give you 30% of the total money sum if you are interested. Goodbye. Hello. I am sorry if this is request that will disgust you. I really am trying to be considerate to you, so i am asking for your assistance to handle this transaction with you. I will give you the details about myself. I am a staff of the Union Bank. I have been in the bank for 4 years now. I am the personal assistance to a late customer of my bank who left this country with a huge sum of money, which he deposited in a brokerage account for safe keeping.The original account holder was a foreigner, a royalist and a banker. His name was Mr. Arthur James. He was a banker and oil consultant to the Royal Family and had a closing balance of US$14,000,000.00 (fourteen million united states dollars). The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after seven years, the money will be claimed by the government and be donated to a reserve account for the deposit of unclaimed money.I was the first and the only person to receive this money. As soon as he deposited the money in the account, he called me to his bank to tell me that he has dies and that his money has been transferred to a bank account outside the country. I refused to accept this money as his money because as a civil servant, I cannot have such money. He told me that it was because of this that he was poisoned by his business partner. So as soon as I got to his bank on the other side of the world, I told them that I would like them to transfer the money out of the country, so that he can come back and claim it.He agreed to give me 30% of the money while keeping 10% for any expenses that I might incure during the process of transferring the money to his account. The rest 70% will be for myself and my colleagues at the Union Bank.Let me hear from you immediately via email. Thank you as i look forward to working with you. Best Regards, MR.SIMON GARUBA MONEY TRANSFER

We have taken great pains to ascertain that the account owner is the bonafide late Jacob Sama who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account since the date of his death.

The fund will be paid to you in two parts, (50% for me and 40% for you). There is no risk involved and the bill will be paid to you immediately the fund hit your account. The receiving bank will remit the remaining balance of the entire sum to you. A confirmation email address will be sent to you immediately you provide. I look forward to your earliest reply to this email address which I am assuring you is the nicest, most caring, most reliable person I have ever met.

====================
Greetings, I am the son of the late president of Republic of Liberia, president of Liberia, and prospered in office until his assassination last year. In the years since his death, his supporters seized and burned down my father's estate; confiscated all his money; and subjected him to forced exile in various European countries. Later, after the assasination, his money was sent to Switzerland and other foreign countries as property by his Government. My late father was a good and regent of a strong monarchy that was in power for the last 13 years before the rebels seized power and killed him. Since the assasination he deposited the sum of (USD$13M) with a private security company in Europe, now he has deposited the money in a private security company in America, where it is deposited with a security guaranty company as family valuables for fear of the rebels attack agains the security company. My late father was an energetic, rule-oriented and morally upright leader who did not support the political ideologies of his rebel brethren. However, my late father was assassinated by his own Government because he did not support their political ideology which led to the current political crisis in my country. My late father was also an industrialist and a member of the rich white farmers which sustained the rebel as a stable government. Since the previous civil government came to power six years ago, the share of the rich white farmers has been increased by 50% and more than half of my father's white farm fields have been donated to the security company for the profit of the security company. As a result of my late father's death, my current husband and I have decided to travel to the US in order to assist him in repatriating the money which he deposited with the security company for the family and to invest it in a profitable business in the USA. As a result of our late father's death, and the recent increase in the share of the security company for the good of the family by the United States Government, we decided to seek asylum in the US which is a friendly country to us and the money which was deposited with the security company has been paid into a security company account for us here which we have agreed to share with him, After the completion of the investment, the money will be sent to the security company for the safekeeping of the money for a period of six years, after which the money will be paid to the security company for the safekeeping of the money for the next of kin of the deceased, so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials who are bent on taking everything that my late father left in his hands for himself. As a result of the government move to expel almost all Christians from the country, as a result of the government announcement that none of his business deal amounted to anything, his family has been searching for any relative from abroad who died with his money and who will act as the next of kin to the deceased since nobody has come up to be next of kin. In order to augment the chances of the success of the operation, a video camera and point-of-sale terminal has been set up in the bank for the payment of the money to the security company as the next of kin. A bank official has been appointed to look for the family relative abroad who has the same name with the deceased as the one the bank official is releasing, thereby helping the family establish a new address. It may also interest you to note that all the arrangements regarding the payment of this money have been put in place, and the security company has been directed to make arrangements for the payment of this fund into the account when it is received. My late father was a fighter for Justice and a man that believed that equity is better than profit. I am honourably seeking for your assistance in the following ways. (1)To provide a bank account into which this money would be paid into  (2)To serve as the guardian of this fund since I want to keep this business venture where the the interest will be for me the only purpose of this email is to solicit your help in executing this transaction with you. If you can assist my family in executing this business venture, you shall be entitled to 25% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance, 5% for any expenses incurred during the execution of this business venture and 70% shall be for me for investment in your country.

The money will be paid into your account as foreign earned income tax (GAT) in your  country.  The money will be received by the trust house  in your country and will be kept in your name for a  period of 5 years, before it will be transfered into any  bank account in your country.  The board of directors of both the above mentioned  trust houses approved the transfer of this  fund of USD 21,000,000.00 (Twenty  one million United States Dollar) to your account.  The board of directors approved the transfer  unanimously.          Many factors went into making this decision but mostly it was  based on the fact that I and my colleagues wanted to go abroad to  do business and do you want to assist us?   Thus, we were  presented with a very good offer from you and are today  about to hand you a contract.   Please, I want you to deal with this contract contract  like I did my colleagues to raise the funds for the  purchase of new machines, tractors and other farm implements   that will be needed in your country as we get some extra money for applying for each year.   We were going to offer you 25% of the total sum, 70% for me and while 5% will go   to make up for any expenses that you may make in the process of this transaction.

SOUTH AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (S.A.D.B)  This bank, is  mandated to have a foreign customer base, with no end in sight, as the government  is making good on our promise to  betray our customer for nothing. On Tuesday, 12th of September, 2000, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa  Government, Mr. David Hatter, made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty-five Million United States dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa  Ministry of Minerals and Energy that Mr. David Hatter, died in a plane crash and that he died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the funds are floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The money is $25,000,000.00(Twenty-five Million United States Dollars). I have since deposited the money with this bank without a beneficiary and I am making plans to withdraw the money from this bank without a beneficiary as well. As a matter of fact, this is the reason why I solicit for your assistance in this transaction, to take care of this money since I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. This money will be kept in a security company, until I receive any notice of claim from any party. I shall be sensitive to any form of transfer or remittance of this money to a foreign account as this money will be coming from a source that I can not trace. I will be grateful to you for your prompt response to this urgent request. I am waiting for your reply through this email address:julianwong59@yahoo.com and telephone:+28-84660176 or by fax:+27-5053474. Yours enthusiastically, Julian Wong. ___________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at WebMail service at W3WebMail.com  http://www.webmail.com

I'm Mr.Morten Kekabu,the Manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. I'm writing in respect of a foreign customer of my Bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in A plane crash. You shall read more about it in this zine http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/25/alaska.crash/index.html He was a citizen of Ghana, but his mother tongue was not his mother tongue so he was brought up in the language of his country. His father was a Ghanaian but he was an American and he was murdered by my senior colleagues in the bank before he could come to join us. Before the death of my colleague, he had taken me to Kalahari, where he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars), in a security company, as family valuables in case of his sudden death. He had deposited this money for safe-keeping with the security company as family valuables in the hope that he would come and receive it. He had also deposited a further RM1,000,000.00 for his family bank account which was to exceed the total amount of the money and he did not. We also intend to sell off the consignment which we have acquired as family valuables and to invest in other safe investments in your country. The total amount involved is $15,000,000.00 ( fifteen  millions United States Dollars), which he deposited for the safekeeping of his money and the money which we are going to invest in his country, in expectation of his immediate response and the receipt of this money in his next of kin. If my colleague did not die on the 25th,I will definitely replace him with a descendant. And then the money will be released and the consignment will be handed over to his next of kin as his next of kin. This is the real reason why I request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account – to invest your share in a profitable venture. I have already approved the withdrawal of $8,500,000.00 which our bank now expects to be shared between us. It may also interest you to know that the amount was deposited on behalf of a foreign client who has exact address as above. 2,5 (Five hundred thousand Uinted United States Dollars) from a private security and finance company. The funds was deposited, as family valuables in a bank account expected to be used by one of my colleagues for a business investment. When the money was deposited, he had written to my partners stating his reasons for wanting the money to be sent to a preferred foreign account but he did not. I have since been contacted by the bank and they are assuring me that they will release the money to a foreign account which my colleagues partners and I are going to establishment. This is the whole situation as follows. On the 25th July, 2000, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWELVE Million United States Dollars($25,000,000.00) in my branch. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Government of Ghana that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that Mr. Barry Kelly did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Government of Ghana.  My colleagues and I are currently in negotiations with the Bank to see if we can resolve the balance of the deposit by transferring the money to a foreign account where it will be safe from Ghana Government Officials.  The Bank seems to be in cahoots with the Government and is willing to reward our colleagues with a huge windfall if we will not work with them. To put this sum of $25,000,000.00 on a moreproportional growth. The tax and settlement committee has been mandated to report back to you on the work that has been done to date but I want you to know that the tax and settling committee has deliberately delayed release of the report due to my authority that I hold in the vein of cahoots. The fact is,we discovered long ago and the tax and settling committee has stated that Mr. Barry Kelly

A/N: I apologize for this letter to you. This is an effort to make you understand my situation better and get your support for a successful transaction. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, the wife of Late General Sani Abacha, former head of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I have also previously communicated via email, but this time I hope you can see the appeal. The current President of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, was assassinated by a splinter group within his own party who were now calling themselves the New Government. I was in the position of forcing myself to take a very hard decision. I had to rely on you as a person and a company to help me get out of this mess. Let me start by first explaining what is happening to me and then secondly why I need your assistance to come over to your country to invest in a good idea and to give me a new beginning. I am glad you can understand, if you can deal with this. I have decided to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% will be set aside for contingencies (cheap hotel room, phone, power outlet bills, etc) and 70% will be for me. Please, I still want to believe it will be a long-term relationship, but I don't want to think about it now. I don't want to scare you, I don't want to hurt you and I don't want you to protect me from my future and future prospects. I will be updating you as soon as i hear from you. I am expecting your urgent reply soon. Please, I want you to protect my self and my family from any form of harm. Meanwhile i look forward to hearing from you soonest. Thank you.

====================
Mariya bhui, 24, from Bundaberg in South Africa, is a student who was deceived by her family  into a washing machine whole family of  her missing father's first cousins was killed.  I met with misfortune last year when my father was due to come over to  South Africa to live in exile in South Africa for allegedly betraying the  South African Government in a cabinet meeting.  Now my late father's first cousin is still in the country awaiting for his  next of kin and he has accused him of being a National of Zimbabwean origin   who betrayed the genuine South African Government and betrayed the interest of my late father's  Country. My father's first cousin was also murdered and Mr. and Mrs. Simpson was attacked with sword and  mace by unknown assailants who ambushed their motor   bus and killed my father. So  the family was forced to move out of South Africa. After they arrived in the  United States, they made an arrangement for the clothes and things   they kept in their luggage  to be moved to their parents' house in Europe and they were   allowed to visit their parents who were both abroad at the time while the   wife and I made the trip to South Africa to stay and start a new life.  Now, after the war, when my father was still alive he deposited the money with a security  company for safe keeping of the money to be moved to a  security fob for Europe to where he had all the vaults with the money before we   moved out of South Africa. My late father told me many times that he deposited the money   in the security company, but I dont believe him because I saw him going into   exile so soon after the war.  I wanted to go to Europe with my brothers to start a new life with my   mother but when we arrived in Europe we found out that all my   mothers are dead now . They also told me that I should find a new   partner who will assist me to move out of the security company and they   will all help me cover all the expenses involved in the move of my   brothers money to Europe. It is because of this that I wish to get out of here now so that we can start a new life with   my new partners so that my family and I can live a life worthy of a man like my   late fathers. I am just 22 years now after the war before my brother's   cousin's attacked our house and killed my mother. My father told me many   times that he deposited the money in the security company   for safe keeping of the money to be moved to a security fob for Europe.  However, I found out that none of our brothers'   relatives has come for the money yet we are all staying in Europe so I want   my late father to tell me that he deposited the money in the security   company for safe keeping of the money and he will never let us out   of the company again.  The company is moving out right now and they are bringing money   every day for us to Europe to come and save but we will never leave Europe   because we are staying in Europe. My partners and I will come over to   Europe and save the money while we travel to Europe to save the   company money and help my father's relatives.

''A man came to my office with an abandoned sum of £15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million pounds) and told me that he had deposited it with a security company but he never called again to make the deposit official and he never called again to claim it according to the law of my country,  he was murdered by his family and he told me that he deposited the money in the security company as a family heirloom and he told me that he will not let me nor any one else claim it until somebody comes over there and  promises to his family that he will present a next of kin to the deceased and also b told me that the security company has no partner and he cannot even get the names of the security company's former partners to his family because he  is a foreigner and he is a man of peace, he told me that he will not let me or any one else claim the money because it is an abandoned money and they will never see it again, he told me that he deposited it as family valuables in the security company with the hope that someday somebody will come and claim it for him. He told me that he was murdered by his family and he told me that the security company is not a good partner for the family because they are all lawyers and businessmen and they will never understand a thing about money and they will never be able to understand that I have the same problem. I said to him that I will like you to assist me so that the two of us can share the money and hopefully my family will be able to go back to normal life. He said that he would like you to help him because he told me that no one will ever come over and claim it from the security company. He said that he will like you to help him, but first he wants you to give him a very good account so that he can make the payment on time and everything will be okay. The director of the security company told me that the money will be released to him as soon as he makes the payment to the security company. I will give you the details of the security company and I will tell you everything that I need from you. Please, I need you to help me to discuss this matter with you and to put you confidence in me and also that you will not let me down either now or in future. I want you to know that I will always have the money in a safe security company if you can not help me. Please write me immediately you receive this mail so that I will let you know the next step to follow in order to finalize this transaction immediately. I am waiting for your response for the promise of this letter and I thank you in advance. PLEASE, READ CAREFULLY AND MAINTAIN SECURITY WITH YOUR LIFE AT REACH.  Yours sincerely. MR.MBEKI ABACHA.

A company that supplies chainsaws to big business has reported a huge profit of US$31 million dollars to the government. The government is investigating the business. I wish to inform you that the whole money has been paid to a reliable and approved bank account that our client is now going to transfer the money to your account. According to laws of my country, if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the treasury as unclaimed fund.Therefore, the request of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and transfer of the money to your nominated bank account. My client has negotiated a good deal with a foreign partner who has agreed to provide him with a good bank account in a good country, so that this money will be transferred to his account in the best interest of both of us. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money is not allowed to stay more than 3 years in a foreign account, but according to the laws of my country, if such money remained unclaimed after three years, the money will be transfered into the treasury as unclaimed fund. I have worked out a good deal with the finance ministry to obtain a good offshore account, and I have secured a good credit rating in the country as an offshore account. Therefore, I need your help to come down to the country to invest this money in a high risk, high reward venture. I do not want this money to go into the treasury as unclaimed fund, so I need you to help me make a good first priority to claim the money. This money will be fully transferred into your account as soon as I hear from you for the verity of the claim. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me, 30% for you and 10% for any other expenses we may incure during the transaction. At the conclusion of this business, you will also be given a percentage share of the money for your assistance that I did not know about. Please, you have been advised to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal. I do not want this money to go into the treasury as unclaimed fund, so I need your assistance to come down to the country to invest this money in a high risk, high reward venture.

Greetings from the Science Centre of Excellence, University of Exeter. I wish to personally apologize for this unsolicited mail, which I feel may be of great interest to you. My name is Joseph Mokore, I am the first son of one of the foremost and rich merchants in Senigal, Lamu Mokore. My early father was a very influential and rich merchant in Kon Okaegi, from which I fled on the 18th of June 1998, shortly after the assassination of late Mr.and Mrs.Hosam Hassan, my late father was murdered by an unknown men who claim to be his business partners, but are actually his bodyguards, and he is currently under house arrest. The business of this office is to receive payment for any services rendered to our country by a foreign firm or individual who has turned up to claim the funds. I have already secured the necessary information with the Father's name, so that I can forward the information to the father's business partner who is in Ghent, Belgium, to receive the funds, but unfortunately he was unable to forward his share of the funds because he is still under house arrest. The money is presently deposited with a security company in Europe to enable the money to be released to my family later. The money has now been deposited with the security company because we cannot release the money now. The funds will be released to you as soon as we both come to an agreement, and both of us will have back up money ( money the money will be remitted to your account in an account to be named later) which we will use to invest in your country. The money will be invested in your country by the funds. I want you to get to Europe very soon, so as to meet me after the meeting to discuss our future investment plans. It is my earnest hope that you will not betray my confidence in you, as this business is 100% risk and trouble free for both of us. It is only you who can help me because as the son of my late father, I have not the slightest bit of knowledge of investment life outside my country, I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Please I only want you to feel free to do this deal with me because if you do not support me, I will spread the word about it to other people so that you will help me get my money's share. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and God bless. Best regards. Joseph Mokore.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, North America's Number One Rate Brokerage, has placed a lien on the account of Mr.  Ugo Nzego of Zimbabwe who is in possession of US$14.4M. This amount was discovered by me in a file in the vault and the prevailing interest is being rolled over with the principal sum if not fully paid off before the account is fully lodged.  The account was opened in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the vault, I discovered that the account owner Mr.   UGO Nzego died without making a [Heir]  hence the amount is being rolled over with the principal sum if not fully paid off. The owner of the account is Mr. UGO Nzego  who is a foreigner and a citizen of Zimbabwe, so the money is being rolled over with the money that Mr. UGO Nzego left in the account.  The amount being rolled over is (USD$14,500,000)  The money is  deposited in a security company account in Europe called SwissTrust Bank Plc, by virtue of its nature as a money  stamp delivery company and money changer, which is why I am contacting you. I have been mandated by a security officer in the bank to arrange for the safety and security of the account before transferring the money to any account  outside the bank where it will be safer for the money to be transfered. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate if you can assist me in arranging for a safe  location that will facilitate the money to be transfered to any safe account that you will nominate for the deposit. I do not want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill, but can only expect that it will be paid into your nominated account.  The money will be paid into your account with the security company account in Europe, if you are to be trusted. The money will be paid into your account with a security company account but I want you to assist me to find a reliable person or company who will assist me in moving the fund to your account.  I do not need any communication from you on the subject. The transaction is 100% risk free. You can always contact me back with your alternatives for a dinner time meeting if you wish, though this is not necessary. All I want you to do is to furnish me with your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. I will provide you with all the information needed to claim the money from the security company. I will also want you to provide me with your bank account where the money will be transfered to. There is no risk involved in this transaction. It will be done over the phone or by email and once the money has been transfered to your account it will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you, as a matter of agreement. The more money you will make, the more you will help me to make into a comfortable life outside Zimbabwe. The more you will help me the sooner you will confirm the money in your account and I will finally let you know the result of the transaction in your country. This is my offer to you. I want you to forward to me immediately your full contact information for verification, for you to be able to claim the money in your account and get a bank account, where the money will be transfered to, so that I will tell you the next step to take urgently. Please get in touch with me immediately through my email. Thank you and God bless. Yours in Christ, Mr. Ugo Nzego. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail : lend me your soul to be immortal! http://www.msn.com/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f

BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - A Thai national who lost both his parents and his younger brother to a landslide in his home country of HONK KONG, has met with the Thai government to seek asylum in Thailand. The relative died a week ago in a landslide which HONK KONG presumed dead swept away his home. The king has approved a total ban on all foreign nationals entering HONK KONG and has ordered the dissolution of all non-HONK KONG bank accounts. The king has also frozen all  bank accounts of all  non-HONK KONG citizens. Banker and businessman Georgeaspoon Thongmul, since the allegations of the brother's purchase of a  diamond mine in Zimbabwe by a foreigner and the royal family has confiscated his house and bank account in  Zimbabwe and threatened to seize all his assets, (if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing). When my late father-in-law tried to deposit the sum of 200,000,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million United States Dollars only).into a local bank account in the country, my late father-in-law was stopped by a Royal BANK official, who told him that the king has made him a prisoner and a money  loser, and that he has no other bank account in the country.  When my late father-in-law was arrested and detained, he deposited the funds with a private security firm  here in the bank where we now live. As  a result of the lengthy and cruel detention, he was released on bail and a visit from the High Court was planned for  the following Monday. When my late father-in-law died, he called me on his bed side and told me that his  late brother and his wife had been killed by the Zimbabwean political leaders,  and that my late father-in-law must have deposited the money in a  security company with the mattress money in mind of getting back to his family in  Zimbabwe as soon as possible, when death is imminent. He also told me that Mr. Eric O. Williams  was a foreigner and an investor in the security and finance companies. The king has detained all his family members except his wife and children, and he is not allowed to travel outside the borders of  HONK KONG NORTH AFRICA. Although, he has no known bank account outside HONK KONG NORTH AFRICA.  He told me that he deposited the money  in the security and finance company as family valuables, and he does not want the money to go into  the security and finance company treasury as  unclaimed bank deposit. He also told me that he deposited the money into the   security company treasury as unclaimed bank deposit. He also told me that he died without a written or oral WILL and no record has  been kept by the security company for the deposit of the money in the security money  account.

---This email received by me from a client at his bank here in Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast.I am a law student of Mr. Donald L. Tate. I am a member of the bank's advisory panel.I wish to introduce first a business proposal to you. My client is a large gold merchants and gold exchanger and the manager of his company here in Abidjan. His company is one of the major exporters of gold in the United Kingdom and other countries with which he is in business. He is a man of high social status who worked for the British Foreign Office for almost three decades prior to his recent death. He had a fixed deposit balance of $32,800,000. 00 (Thirty-two million eight hundred and eighty two thousand dollars) with a bank in the United Kingdom. The fund comprises the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my client and his company by my late father. After the death of my father, he deposited the money with the Bank in the United Kingdom as family valuables. The bank officials will not disclose the actual contents of the box until after the death of the deceased (BAH) so I am in need to monitor closely the box to see what is in the box. I have named you as the next of kin of my father so that the box will be opened and the money will be paid to you. The box will be delivered to you in a secret box. I will ensure that the box is opened and the money paid to you. Then we will meet face to face for the mutual benefit in sharing of the fund because there is no other person that the fund will benefit. I am in need of a reliable and honest person to work with to make this plan a reality. Please, if you are capable and willing to assist me, get back to me immediately for further discussion.I am willing to give you 20% of the total money for your assistance. Please get in touch with me on my direct email address, so that I can give you more details. Please get in touch with me on my answer@hkdomail.com. You can also call me on this email address, my private phone number, and my Fax number for opening an account. I am waiting for your response to this email. Thank you and God bless you. Yours truly, Donald L. Tate.

A beard that sticks out from under his suit and tie, allows him to look like any person he wishes, even boys. The suits he wears to work in the bank are made from real money, and he always carries a bill or two with him at all times. On his death we discovered that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace any relation were fruitless. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Adeola Ortiz did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Adeola Ortiz so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding, Yours sincerely, DR ALI IBRAHIM. _________________________________________________________________

====================
President Bush addressed the American people in television address for the first time, for the first time ever, and he made it very clear that his first priority is to secure the hard earned money in the accounts ready for payment to the American people by the foreign partners, during his annual vacation in Crawford, Texas.  The President assured the American people that he is in charge and will prevail on their behalf the whole time because he is in control, he would not hesitate to use any means to assure the money is secure and will not leave the account until the money is paid to the alleged next of kin. Since the money is deposited in a random  account and the account has no name attached to it, the account owner will never know about the account until the account owner is killed or when the account is opened again by another foreign beneficiary. American citizens will not like this, so the president told me he will give me a deposit certificate with a name that will not be used in the future for any purpose other than to ensure that the money is paid to the account holder. I have agreed to offer you 10% of the total amount as compensation when the money gets paid to you,5% will be used for settling expenses and cost of transfer and the remaining 95% will be for my personal use. The money will be paid into your account within seven to eight working days. Please, I want you to know that I have killed all the old and dead stock and presently i have all the legal approvals from the attorney to transfer the money to any account you will provide. I will advise you on how to claim the money from the account before we fly to your country for subsequent sharing of the funds between us. Please I want you to give me your full address and your full contact information as soon as possible for easy and effective communication. I will need your full telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication. I am expecting your immediate response and if you agree with my ideas and think it will enable us see this transaction through, then please get back to me immediately with your personal phone and fax number for easy and strong communication. All I want from you now is for you to furnish me with your full names, your address, your active bank account number for easy and effective communication. Please do not destroy this opportunity and please do not destroy my life because you do not want this money to be transferred to the account holder. I can also transfer this money to any safe overseas account you can provide but I will not foment any problem in this regard. My life will be spared and my children's lives will be spared as there will be no fomenting in this regard.All I want you to do is to furnish me your full names and your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication. Thank you. Blessings, Mr. Samuel A.F. Arthur. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail sur i-mode� : envoye avec e-mail : metallemagazine@msn.fr

(Reuters Health) — There is many reasons why it is important to be of two minds with regard to whether or not to continue to participate in this previous year's SURF Contest. For one, there was the controversy that surrounded the energy from the giant canadas (cattle) brought in from abroad to compete (in this contest) that caused a lot of cancellation of previous year's contributions. On the other hand, there is the recognition that it is quite difficult to find a partner who will assist you in a transaction of this nature and especially not one who will not be aware of the controversy that has arisen around the signing of the contract(TECHNICAL AND RELATIVE) between the contractor and the State (COTECUMES DEVELOP) that surrounds the money. As a matter of fact, the whole contract has been signed and electronic funds have been paid to the contractors. The problem now is, who will come forward to claim the funds and what to do next since no one has come forward. My suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the beneficiary of this contract and this is possible since I am a foreigner. You are not to be exploited by the contractor, I will use the fact that you are a foreigner to help me see this transaction through since nobody will come forward to claim the funds and the contract has been signed. You are to assist me in the following ways: 1) To take care of the finances of the company while I continue my studies inlaw/lawrence 2) To make arrangements on investments that will yield great return on investment. 3) To be a locus for this transaction with assistance from the local bank where the money will be deposited since the money is in US Dollars. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total sum while 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during the transfer process and longer term expenses. Please I would like you to provide me with your full name and contact address so that I can forward your contact information to your Federal High Court and send you the application that you will complete and claim the funds. I will also like you to furnish me with your banking particulars: your personal information including your private telephone and fax number. As soon as I receive your urgent reply I forward your personal information to Mr. Georges Peterson who is in charge of the account (TECHNICAL AND RELATIVE) of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and he will direct the official documentation to be sent to your Federal High Court and Federal Embassy for verification and release. Please my dear friend, with this money I will like to invest in real estate management, real estate syndication and hotel management in various countries. I will like to do this with the help of a National Foreign Trade Mission to help me make arrangements on how to transfer this money to your account and I will also like you to assist me in finding a late partner to act as the next of kin to the deceased and also to help me move out this money to a safe and reliable account abroad. This transaction is 100% risk and trouble free and will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please, if you are interested in this deal, please get in touch with me and convince me to change my/your mind and to help me take care of things.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application that will enable you confirm the money in the account and also the payment instructions that you will complete and also the returning address where the money will be remitted. I will also like you to ensure that you keep this contract and transaction secret for security reasons. I will also like you to provide your private telephone and fax number if any and also your bank account information. I am looking forward to your urgent reply. Thanks you in advance. Thanks and God bless. Yours sincerely, Michael Haignein

From The Desk Of Mr.Benedict McGurk. C.E.O  NOVEMBER 2003. The  Office Of The Bank Manager. FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.  AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  (A.D.B) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA. Dear Friend, What is most required of you at this stage is to   investigate and find out if                                   I am writing this letter to you today because I know you will  be capable to assist me in this transaction. I am Mr.Benedict McGurk, The Chief Operating Officer of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa, with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be extremely beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a ghastly auto accident along kaboree line with his wife and only daughter who was in hospital due to brain aneurysm. The said amount was U.S $30M (Thirty Million United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account number/telephone number for easy communication and  information sharing. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money will be paid to the person who will stand as next of kin to the deceased by the bank. The money will be paid into his account as unclaimed fund while no other person will know about this money. It is my opinion that using this money wisely, we can manage this transaction well into the future knowing that this money will be transfered into the account as unclaimed fund. I wish to first transfer $10,000.000.00 (ten million United States Dollars) from the account into your account. I will give you 25% of this money for your assistance and assistance in providing a safe account for this money. After the first transfer, I will visit your country for disbursement accordingly to the percentage indicated. (10% for you, 75% for me). However, I will not sit on this money I know it will never go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I will not bother to identify myself to the bank nor will I disclose further details about myself. Please, I will appreciate your candid assistance in locating a reliable foreign partner who will assist us.  With God all things are possible.  Thank you.  Mr.Benedict McGurk.
 
====================
I never knew you to be such a pain in the ass, but I feel so sorry for you. I am another foreigner with a clientele that is heavily laden with foreigners, and myself am a foreigner with a clientele that is heavily laden with foreigners. I am sure I speak for everyone in the office when I say that this proposal is urgent and required. My client and I are doctors and alchemists, and as such we have no reliable accounts to do with bank accounts. I have two options for you, either you will provide us with an account or you will provide your bank account where we can transfer this money and use it in a joint investment of  25% and 70% for me and for your own investment, while 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses we make during the time this money is being transferred to your account, while 70% will be for you and for any expenses we make along the way. The remaining 5% will be set aside to settle any overdraft from any of the different accounts you might provide, while 5% will be set aside for expenses that might come as a result of the transfer. Please note that there is no risk involved in this transaction, as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,please reply immediately. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and rest in God. Yours sincerely, MR. MUSA UMBE _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail sur i-mode� : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre  téléphone portable.

====================
For your kind attention,  At first I won't read through your message again, due to the serious nature of this message.but when I do  I am compelled to do so, because as a woman I find this message very appealing.    I am Lord John Aboh,  The   Head Farmer of the Ezekial Farm in Northern Nigeria. I am married with four lovely kids, which i have decided to relocate to your country because i don't have any relation here.    I used to work for a gold and diamond company here in Nigeria but because of my salary and the amount i am owed by the gold and diamond company, I have decided to relocate to Europe because economically my life is no more.  I have lost all my savings because of the gold and diamond company's gold and diamond sales and my bank account has been frozen by the gold and diamond company. As a result of this situation, I have lost all my connections and am afraid that I will never be able to find anybody to assist me to relocate to Europe because I am now stranded here in Nigeria.    For you to assist me to relocate to Europe, you will first take care of investing my share in a bank in Europe where I plan to invest to make the next life for me and my kids possible.   After I am done with these life changing business ventures, you will take me to your country where I will send you my future and I will offer you 15% of the total sum.   I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% Risk free and completely confidential. I have secretly discussed this matter with Mr. Barry Kelly, President of Russian diamond and mining corporation here in Europe who is my partner in this project and he has also secretly assured me of the successful completion of this project. Thank you in advance for your anticipated quick response and I hope to hear from you soon. God bless you as you always be of assistance to me and my family. In this letter mail, do not forget to include your private telephone and fax numbers.   Yours faithfully,  Lord Aboh Im. Lord John Aboh

Please, I want you to call me and send me an email address when you receive this mail. because i am waiting for your response.  Ill give you all the details on how I will use my position and influence to get this money out to any foreign account that you will advise me to recommend for the deposit.

You will also advise on options for an effective and successful line of business. I am looking forward to your acknowledgment to this mail. from me.   Delete
 FROM MR.MADAM MALLAMABE FROM MR.MADAM MALLAMABE. Dear friend. I am Mr.Madam Mallamabebu, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my bank. I am writing to- persuade you to assist in the transfer of US$15,000,000.00 thousand dollars to your account. This fund represents interest earned from a consultancy contract we executed for the late Engr. Peter Claude,I would like to believe that this transaction would not even be a problem. However, on the transfer we sent to his advisors,  they told us that the contract has been executed and payment is due from the contractor. We are now in the process of paying off the entire  sum due from the contractor. We want to make sure that the appropriate account has been established by which we will be able to collect the fund. As a matter of fact, we have already started collecting the interest from the oversea payments made to our bank by Mr. Peter Claude,I am only contacting you as a foreigner to claim this money as the oversea beneficiary because we will not want this money to go into the account of any other foreigner. Please, note that the money is currently in a suspense account in a private security company, and if we do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account. It will not be safe for any long term resident since we cannot access the account any more. Also, the account has no other beneficiary either and until he dies he is the manager of his company. It will not be safe for any foreigner either, as we can´t release the money to any foreigner, because the money will be eagerly awaited by any foreigner who is willing to work with us. Unfortunately, the current civilian administration in Nigeria do not approve of the foreign partner, and I am afraid that this foreign partner will not abide any longer to our interest. Therefore, we must seek for a reliable foreigner who will assist us in the transfer of this money to a foreign account and then we will share the money equally. I want to first transfer $15,000.000.00 out of this money before we can try any new ideas. However, I want you to help me get this money into your account for investment, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner to ensure that you will not refuse to assist us. I will also need your private phone and fax numbers to enable me contact you for further discussions. However, I don't need any further information from you about your Country or your personal characteristics, all I need from you at this moment is your private phone and fax number for easy communication. I need your full co-operation and trust to be able to judge your sincerity and honesty properly to this transaction as I am still in active service to my country and I don't want this money to go into the Treasury as an unclaimed fund. It is quite simple, a foreigner who feels that he has done a favour to his country by helping us acquire this money will contact you and you will forward the money to his account where the money will be kept in security until we actually use it in a profitable business, which I will not fail to inform you that my intention of contacting you at this time is purely for your assistance and assistance in the transfer of the money to your account to invest in a profitable business. I am awaiting your response urgently. Respectfully, Mr.Madam Mallamabebu.

I am Dr.Nelson A. S. Banks.The Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.  With due respect and regard,I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash on the 1st of December,1999 with his entire family on board. While speculating on the source of the money, my department came across a huge sum of money which was deposited by the person who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. The fund was valued at US$22,500,000.00 (Twenty- two Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). The fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our name. Since I have been searching for the person,the last owner of the account,he has been refusing to relocate the fund and would not let me locate the next of kin to the deceased for obvious reasons.  I am now faced with the dilemma of trying to locate the deceased by sending in an application to the bank to prove the person's identity but my colleague's time is not good either; he is terminally ill and he is not likely to live long enough to see the benefits of a new life.  So, I no longer want a life of a burden I have to live.  I am seeking for someone to assist me in transferring the money into your account for investment purposes and I am willing to give you 20% of the funds for your assistance.  Please, I want this money to be invested in something safe for me and my family since I cannot travel out of Burkinabe any more.  Please I will like to inform you the benefits of the transaction and also how you can help me. I am willing to offer you 20% of the money for your assistance and 5% will be for any expenses you might incur while the rest will be for my investments in your country. I am expecting your reply immediately. PLEASE, ATTN. WITH OPEN MIND I WANT YOU TO KEEP THE FOLLOWING EMPLOYMENT &amp; BUSINESS PROFILE ACTIVELY SECRET:  1. YOUR FULL PHYSICAL/MOTIVE ASSISTANCE:  2.

====================
In a move that could be just months in coming, the Chinese Government have decided to freeze all known assets of late head of state, General Sani Abacha (R) including properties, money and bank accounts of high officials in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The move could also see the general government cut off all official relations with the former head of state. As it is, I have been mandated by my new position as the managing director and head of the department to make this transfer to a foreign bank account to service the funds until our next of kin come up and claim it.  The money would be paid into your account as a contracted account, 40% of the money will be for me, while 60% will go for you. Please, I want you to understand that this transaction is 100% risk-free and I will do everything in my power to ensure that no body trasports this money into any account and we don't loose a dime ! I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. I only communicate with you in this email because this money is an embarrassment to my family, it is also subject to a sensitive arrangement with the National Government. I am seeking for your  assistance in the following ways: to provide a bank account where this money would be transferred,  to serve as the Overseas Account Holder of this money and to execute a contract for the investment of 10% of this money. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total money for your help in this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately immediately and provide your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication. I am expecting your urgent reply through this email. Thanks.  Yours sincerely. MsLLOYD WENG LADYBABY EDITOR NOTE: THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT A CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL. You may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don't know me  in person. I am Dr LLOYD WENG LADYBABY,the personal assistant to the former head of state, General Sani Abacha (backed         General Sani Abacha). You may also be surprised to receive this message from me since you don't know me  in person. I am a member of the Independent Committee of   Eminent Persons (ICEP), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bank Manager of General Sani Abacha  (R). I came across your contact on the Internet while searching for a reliable person to handle a  very confidential transaction. The IceP is a semi-autonomous Federal   Bank of Nigeria, which is subordinate to the Central Bank of Nigeria. ICEP is  deliberately chosen for this confidential transaction given its peopel geographic and    historical location. It may interest you to know that General Sani Abacha (R)   was the former Head of State and President of the Federal Government until his   sudden death in the US presidential election defeat. You may also   note that General Sani Abacha (R) did not have an Embassy in any part of the world. He   chose to hide out in DR Congo for security and financial reasons. Thereby, he accumulated a huge amount of   money which has since been frozen by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into two frozen   accounts, one in Geneva and the other in London. Please note that I have done a thorough

^ before we even started the mediation. The [N.C.O] has already approved [our sending in a certified cheque payment] for the total sum of US$12,900,000.00 (twelve million dollars only) to our bank account,but the [N.C.O] still wants to discuss the   remaining balance of the US$11,900,000.00 with both parties. I would like you to assist me get out of here alive, so that I can get to my relatives in Africa for the holidays,because my life is in danger now. I am ready to give you the details of the money deposit,if it is real. Please, I want us to reach a long term agreement, so that our share will be shared between us, not our exploitors. I need your full co-operation to make this happen. Because I don't have any other way out for myself now, I have become a woman that I cannot drive a car or operate any bank account in my name. My only option is to go into partnership with a man to work as our agent so that we can secure a real ESTATE for this money in his name. I need your full agreement in order to proceed. It will be an agreement between us that will pave the way for me to leave this country. To start with, we will work out a merger of the account that your account is currently in with the one in your name and secure an account for this money in your name.  After which, our share will be US$6,600,000.00 (six million dollars only), and your percentage share will be 30% of the total amount. We will work together well to come back to your country after which I will fly to your country for sharing the money and I will send you a certified cheque payment forms to deposit the money into the account. I don't have any other choice, I have to relocate my family, because my husband is not here to help me and he will not help me, he will only fight and kill me.I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but I am going to assure you that it can be approved to any foreigner with foreign bank account because my husband's family are not allowed to operate a foreign account, nothing will be changed to the account, they will just be a witness to the money. If you accept this offer to help me as a foreigner to act as our agent in the transaction, I will appreciate it very much. If you want to work with me, I will give you the details of the account I will like you to work with. I will need your full co-operation to make this work, because it will take me 4 weeks to bring the money to your account. Please do not put any limit in your participation, you can work with me for 8 weeks and then you can go back to your country and the money will be transferred to your account in your name. As soon as this money is transferred to your account, I will come over there and collect my share. My decision is that I will like you to come back to my home country as soon as possible to receive the money because I don't want any foreigner working with me, I will prefer you to work as an agent for the family. My husband's agent will destroy all documents of dowry and seize all documents of any kind, including your passport, phone and bank account for life, for no apparent reason. He will also demand money from you immediately I receive this money to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the time of transfer and also confiscate any valuable things you might have and instill them in your head as soon as possible. I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but I am going to assure you that it can be approved to any foreigner with foreign bank account because my husband's family are not allowed to operate a local account, nothing will be changed to the account, they will just be a witness to the money. If you accept this offer to work with me, I will give you the details of the account I will like you to work with.

$155,000,000.00 USD

The sum of $155 Million Dollars  was discovered by me while searching for a genuine foreign partner. I could not have the trust of the client or anyone connected to the client when I make this  proposal. The client is Mr. George paul, a citizen of Ghana ,  and industrialist, but also a merchant and politician. He is 57years old and has been ill for the past 5 years now. Before his death he was the treasurer of his party and was a member of the local and foreign reserves council, but I will not disclose the contents of my report to you.  My reason for writing to you is to offer you this opportunity for a successful transaction. This fund was discovered by the bank when it was being  processed by the  Department of Financial Services in South Africa. The latter sent  me a reminder to forward the necessary documents and letter of probate  in your favor for the release of the fund. Please I want you to treat this transaction with 100 percent  secrecy and confidentiality. I am trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future. I implore you to please bear in mind that this  transaction is 100% risk and trouble free. As soon as we reach a mutually beneficial  agreement to share the fund, we shall proceed to lodge a  claim for the fund in your favor as the beneficiary to the  fund. I need your assistance to come down to South Africa to open a bank account  account in your country which will facilitate the transfer of this  fund to your account in your country. As soon as I receive your affirmative response, I will give you my details for you to know  what to do once the fund is transferred to your account in your  favor. I will also try to reach you through Facebook, but your computer is  not allowed to send or receive email without a valid e-mail address  which you will provide. I will also issue you a letter of the bank confirming  it is indeed the real money and not a fake and that you will not lose the  money to fraud. So this is my plea to you. If you cannot accept this offer, we will gladly  give you 20% of the total money. If you are interested,please reply immediately or call me on phone number +770,248  233 1 444. I want you to understand that this is my first offer and in no  way is it to be taken lightly. I am serious minded person and I mean business. I don't want  any problem. I really needs your full cooperation in this transaction. As soon as I hear from you, I  will give you all the information necessary for you to  make a reliable and safe investment. I want you to treat this  transaction as a top secret because I will not know what to do with the  information that comes in the mail to my mailbox. I will also tell you the reason  why I want this money to be kept top secret and confidential. Let me  assume that you agree to this deal and I will be glad if you will  cooperate with me and use your name in bank to bank account to deposit this  money. However, I am not against you. I know that I can do this deal with you  at the end of it. You will get your money back for it after you  have received the money from the bank on your account. I  will get 20% of the total money as commission and 5% will be set  aside to take care of expenses we will both had in  future. I have looked to do this deal with some shady  people but all their names were found useless and no one has come forward. So I  am going to give you the name of a man that I believe is able to  handle this proposal and this is why I need you to get this  money into your account. This transaction is 100% Risk Free and you will never  see your money again. I am not worried you will lose this money. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money  is not safe for a foreigner, but I will take care of providing  a new bank account to a foreigner if you will be willing to work with me. As soon as the money  is there, I will give you all the documents of deposit to  open a new bank account. I will also give you a phone number so you can  call me on phone number 11588552385 to  help you open a new account. Interest is free. I will not give you any  information about my bank unless you tell me about it. You will understand  why i am contacting you now and remember that you  will never let me down in this business. I will also promise to never sue you for  this money again, because you never know what might happen. I am  giving you this information in  confidence that this money will be kept top secret and  confidential and that

A federal judge in South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for the late head of state of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, for contempt of court. The warrant was issued after an investigation revealed that Robinson and other officials in the government were not aware of the Federal Court judgment in the case of the late head of state, Robert Mugabe, until the media reported on it. The warrant was signed and approved by the Federal High Court to issue a notice to Mr. Robert Mugabe to produce his bank account details or be imprisoned for a year, or both.

The new regional fountains of the Federal Government Limited liability company (BLKN) have been inaugurated in the following cities/regions: Åland, Cathay-Palace, Cotonou-Cote D'ivoire, Éire, Illyria, Ivory Coast, London.My father was a very well-known and wealthy farmer and gold and diamond merchant in the country and he was murdered for reasons that will never be known to his family. I and my mother have since sought for refuge in South Africa from where we are presently seeking asylum. My father's business was one of the chief reasons why my family have sought asylum in the first place. However, after his murder and shortly before he was to be assassinated, he was expected by the government to give a long-term business going account of the sum of US$150,000,000.00(FIFTEEN Million,Eight Hundred Million,Twenty One Thousand Dollars) for safe keeping only for himself and his family but unfortunately he was murdered so that account would remain dormant and this money can only be claimed by us as asylum seekers currently in the country as the family valuables. This is why my family are presently seeking asylum in South Africa to seek asylum and to try and collect the money from the government that has placed all the demands on the family and have frozen all their bank accounts. I don't know anyone else that can come to claim this money because my family is an asylum seeker and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. I don't want this money to go into the government treasury as unclaimed money. I don't want the government to know what has happened to my family and to what extent they have injured them. Please help me and my family get this money into your account as the family valuables by giving me your full names and address so that I can forward to the account office as the next of kin the following informations:                            your full names and address.    The above has been done and there is still a lot of work to do. There are still some minor information about your social life that I will give to you while you will not miss a thing. The most important thing I will need is your bank account details. I have one in the Northeast region of the United States but if you don't want to do this deal I will still move the money into your account as the family valuables by providing your bank account. All I need is your full name and address so that I can find you. Thanks and God bless you. Yours Sincerely,   MR.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (CTU) — A federal judge has issued an arrest warrant for VICTOR HOOPER, the son-in-law of President R. W.  HOBLE who died mysteriously as a result of an automobile accident. The accident happened in the United States of America on January 5, 1998. All that is known about him since then is that he was a rich businessman who died without a written or oral will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the late President R.W. HOBLE so that an account to which he has given no known next of kin will be created and this money will be paid into your nominated account as the next of kin. The money will be paid into your account as the principal sum of the accident and interest on the account. The bank official will carry out the necessary investigation and verification so that all the payment documents that will be sent to your account will be executed and the account will be paid into your account by the bank official. There is no risk involved in this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the payment documents will be pre-filled and the account will be paid into to your account in five working days. Upon receipt of your certified response, I will send to you an accurate application form which you can send to the bank for processing and verification. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% Risk free. On your acceptance to this proposal, you will be given 40% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of this transaction. I look forward to your earliest reply through my alternative email address. It will be very nice to have you as a next of kin.

====================
Lately, I have been seriously considering selling my house and going into self-employment, but I still don't know how I am going to invest the money I inherited from my parents. My father kept a huge sum of money in two bank accounts, one in Europe and one in America. My mother used to joke that the money in the accounts in Europe and the money in the accounts in America have been used for the past 5 years in a Ponzi scheme, and my father paid for the storage of the money and souvenirs in the accounts with money he received from the Olympic Games in Africa and other foreign partners. He used my name as his firstchild and he intended to use it to set up a new life, but he could not invest the money because his partners were not prepared to give him what he wanted. He died alone and his remains were never seen and buried. Before his death, he deposited the money in the account in the European bank and we are the only ones who can see the account.I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. This is the reason I am contacting you.My name is O.K.Babe. I am 24 years and 1 day, I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank and I want you to assist me in transferring this money into your account for investment. The money will be paid into your account as a gift certificate for my partnership with your help. The money will be paid into your account as unclaimed fund. The bank must first transfer the money to your account in the account for investment. I want you to assist me in confirming the money in your account and I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free. A deal of this nature must be concluded so that you will not be bothered by the bank. contact me. Thanks and God bless you as I wait for your responses.Yours sincerely. Paul He who has lost his whole life (his wife, three children and a wife of late Mr. James He) was a man of peace. He had a home where he deposited his gold when gold was cheap and he used it to buy new things and stocks. He was beloved by all because he was honest and straightforward. He died in a ghastly motor accident that hit him on the eve of his wedding with his wife when they were on their way to attend a formal bi-nation festival in South Africa.The family was killed because of the Government policy that prohibits citizens of ddr-europe such as his wife and children to operate bank accounts. It is my personal belief that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the funds will be transferred to the Treasury as unclaimed fund. The family will be entitled to share of the funds for property disposal if they so wish. Please be informed that this transaction is 100% risk free, on both sides. The family will not get involved with the bank until the money have been transferred into the Treasury as unclaimed fund. I will be at your place for the transfer and then fly to your country for investment, as your personal advisor will be needed for this transaction. You will be compensated with 25% commission from the money and 5% will be set aside for expenses both of us may incur during the transfer process. The rest will be for myself and my family to come over to your country to stay and live in your country. There is no risks involved in this transaction. I will provide you with all necessary details. Please confirm your response to my personal email address: paul_he@yahoo.com and paul_he@craigslist.org Thank you and God bless you. Paul He.

Sprint QoS (Quality of Service) : This is a case in which I am the one the customer is after, so I want you to know how I feel and what I want from you. I am Monica. I am the only daughter of late Mr and Mrs.Marcos Jackson (a rich farmer from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire) and my father Mr.Bill Jackson was a very good and successful businessman in my country and I was always going to re-enter the world of business. But, early this year, he was poisoned to death by his business associate and business partner and he was only able to die from the wound after a very long illness. Shortly before his death, he came to see me in the hospital where he was being treated for his wounds and he asked me to personally deliver his money because of the amount involved. I did so and he returned the money with the money in his pocket for safekeeping and he gave me his notes/account. The notes/account are stashed in a trunk box here in my country and the box is sealed. There is a penitentiary here in Abidjan that I have been granted a dispensation to move out of and I was told that for the security of the money in the box the money was to be moved to an office in Europe where it will be kept until my partner and he come over to meet me there for future sharing of the money as they are not safe from me anymore. The box is sealed to prevent the contents from escaping and further investigation revealed that the money was never moved from the office. I am therefore currently in the need of a foreign partner who is going to invest the money in a lucrative business and he said he would like me to assist him. My part in this is that I will like you to act as a guarantor of the money since I am still in the hospital and I don't have any partner I could use as a guarantor. I would like you to assist me in every possible way in moving the money to your account with the Secret Service of which I have the confidence as a matter of fact, I am willing to offer you 30% of the total money if you really help me receive the money into your account. I will also like you to assist me in any other necessary necessary expenses that I made during the process of securing the information. I am ready on all information that you will take in assisting me. The sum of the information concerned is $39,000,000.00 USD. If you are interested in helping me, I will be glad to give you more details information as soon as it is ready. I need your cooperation to receive this information to your account in your country and then I will come over to your country to meet you in your country for sharing. I will be expecting you to meet with me in your own office for the sharing according to the agreed percentage. You will be advised to come and meet me there and assist me in securing the office and getting the information in your account. I will be expecting you to meet with me over there as soon as I am convinced of your capability and willingness to assist me. Whatever the decision you need to do please do not to hesitate to let me know through email address: mr_sochimapbaca00@yahoo.com for your response and then I will give you more details on how I want the money to be spent from here on out as I get your positive response. I will also allow you to have a bank account out of which the money will be transferred to your account. The information on this site is a fact and everthing concerning the information and the information about this account is a fact. Thank you and God bless as I wait for your urgent response. Best regard, PRESIDENT BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,  MR. SOCHIMA FUNOHILIMA 
 
====================
(StatsBlogs) – Massachusetts Representative Ellesee Sanford, Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a press release issued on Monday, February 17, 2004, announced that he had seized the sum of US$18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million US dollars) as a result of a contract awarded to a foreign firm by the House of Representatives, and the money has been with the account of one of their clients, a Chinese firm, for a period of ten years, irrevocably deposited with the House of Representatives as an unexpired lease agreement. The client was a Chinese shipping company that was expecting payment from its foreign customers because his company was being controlled by the Viet Cong. The contract was executed and payment of the total contracted amount was paid to the foreign customers. However, the contract was cancelled because of the war in Vietnam, the US$18,000,000.00 was decided to be spent non-financially on non-military purposes, until sometime in the future, when it will be used for the purchase of a new car for one of the members of the foreign customers' family. The contract was cancelled without informing the client, the reason being that the contract was executed and payment was made to the foreign suppliers and the contractors that supplied the parts for the project. However, no one from the Vietnamese Government ever came to claim the money, the reason being that the contract was executed and payment was made to the foreign suppliers. It was, therefore that I discovered the client and his family had been killed during the war in a car bomb blast that hit their home. I have since then been searching for a foreigner that will assist me to claim the money and whose bank account I can contact the government through for claim as the next of kin, to the deceased. I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased by providing your bank account for the payment of the money. This I want to do, because as House Affairs Committees, we cannot have any problem in this area. I want you to provide me with your complete bank information, your personal account number, your private email address, your mobile phone number for easy and effective communication. I do not want you to handle this money as my family will destroy you if I knew about this money. I will also destroy any chance of a child supporting my future as I will lose my job and my home if this money goes into the family bank account. This is the reason why I propose that you could help me receive this money by providing your safe bank account for the payment of this money. I will be giving you the information about my bank when I hear from you. You could also come up as a family member to the deceased for the immediate transfer. I do not want this money to go into the house as a legacy to me. This money will be kept in a security company by the House of Representatives and my family will claim it. This money will be paid into your account and then sent to you via western union. I do not want this money to go into the security company. This money will be kept in a security company by the House of Representatives and my family will claim it. This money will then be sent to Western Union. I will gladly give you more details when asked. I will also destroy any future chance of this money ever going into the security company or any bank account owned by the Rothschild family. I will destroy any future relationship I might have. I will destroy any future investment I might make in your country.The only thing I want you to do right now is to send me an email address so we can go over the details. Please note that during the time of transaction, your mailbox is to be kept strictly Secret. If you decide to help, you can contact me as soon as you receive this letter. You are to confirm your acceptance to assist my family, on receipt of this money in your mailbox, by this email, that I have waiting for you in my the email address. please confirm acceptance. Thank you for your anticipated time. Yours sincerely, Representative
 
====================
 and inadvertantly left in a letter in my private file. This letter was carefully prepared by me and my secretary and it may interest you to hear that it was signed "Dr."MUSA ZONGO who was responsible for preparing some foreign exchange contracts for a Chinese partner before he was assassinated. The original documents of the contract were justifiably paid for, but the wording of the agreement behind the wages and hour of work was clearly stated, so the Chinese partners intended to pay out over-invoiced wages to their foreign workers. This caused a lot of discontent and damage to the local economy. After careful consideration, I decided to exploit this situation and transfer this much money to a foreign account. This money was $14.5M (Fourteen million five hundred thousand dollars) and it was intended for investment in real estate and hotels in Europe and America. This money was deposited into a private security company vault, $14.5M. I shall be grateful if you can help me in this transaction because the money will be invested in your name as the beneficiary. This money equals to the total sum of $32,000,000.00USD ( Thirty Two Million United States Dollar). I shall be grateful if you can help me in this transaction too.This money has been doctored for a long time and was seized by the Secret Service. The money has been redisclosed, but the Secret Service has placed orders for the money to be moved to another security company vault for safe keeping. The money will be paid into your account as the beneficiary, this money will be paid into your account on behalf of the owner of the account who is a foreigner too. I will be attending a conference in Europe together with a few of my friends, who are planning to come to America for the same reason. I will be giving you 20% of the total amount, 5% will be cut and 70% will be for me. If you are really sure of your trustworthy and accountability to my good friend, you should  contact me immediately using his personal phone number. You have to send me your details in a private phone and fax number, so that I can give you the letter of the trust and accountability to the fund.It may be hard for you to hear, but I don't need you to know that I am really afraid of what is going to happen to my friend. Because I know that I can rely on you to remain the one to look for my lost friend. I will give you all the information that I need from you to enable me find my lost friend. I can also promise you a lot of money if you will assist me. I am ready to give you more detail information on this transaction, because I don't want any problem. Trust me, this is a risk free transaction. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate it very much. I understand that this is very confidential. I would like to first make you a friend via the email address above. Then I will explain to you how I got your contact information. Then I will ask you to advise me on how we can proceed. This is my idea of a game plan. I don't want to loose this money for nothing. Please read carefully. I would like you to continue to be truthful to me when I am seeking your assistance. I will give you all the details that I need to know as soon as I confirm your interest. I want you to treat this transaction as a major life change. After which, you will be able to  come over to my country and live with us. This is my absolute trust and confidence in you and also the person that I need for this important business transaction. It will be a no risk transaction.I don't know any foreigner, so I am relying on you to make sure it will be a life time success. I will be your private eyes, ears and mouth to be sure.

With their wealth and influence, can they not afford to miss the money and bribe the police off the money trail  that Mr. Gary Wong left in the bank? This money  was supposedly for the purchase of new  motor cars and ammunitions for the  new war in Africa. This money has been paid to the officials of my client's  family who were murdered. This money is still sitting in the bank awaiting  claim.

My portfolio agency was looking for a trusted partner that would support our mission to transfer the sum of $15,000,000.00(fifteen million United States dollars only) into a foreign account. The fund was accrued during the gold and diamond sales that we made during the last year of the former president of Ghana. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. Before the death of my client, he deposited the total sum of $15,000,000.00(fifteen million United States dollars only) in a private security company for safe keeping.

This fund was accrued from various  transactions made by my late father, when he was  the Minister for Agriculture in the late President's  Government. The funds is presently lodged with a private security firm in Europe, as a money  deposit. As a matter of fact, the  shares in his foreign account have been seized by the Goverment, and the further we  investigated the amount involved, it became quite evident that the  funds did not belong to him and that he has  been the victim of a political assassination plot. As a result, we have made  arrangements to transfer the fund to any foreign bank account and tax free bank account,  whether of an individual or company. However, due to our sensitive position as top officials in  the Government, I would not want you to know that I have secured  approval from the Office of the Banker to transfer the  total sum to your account.

I get text messages all the time from people all over the world who are really, really sorry and want to put someone else in charge of this transaction, but I can't because I'm still in the service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. Therefore, I am contacting you to be the next of kin to the deceased, so that you will be able to receive his funds. The money in this account is unknown to me, and I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed after the fact.  Therefore, I am soliciting for your services as a thank you gift for your assistance. Please I need you to act as the next-of-kin to the deceased by providing your bank account where the money will be deposited and by responding back to my FB and my other FB friends so that I can forward you the application which will be sent to the bank as the beneficiary of the money.  The money will be paid into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin.  I will pick the funds that will be deposited in your account, and they will be shared between me and them using the method of the payment in this country. These are the basics of the deal. If you are interested, please reply back immediately on my FB and you will have the chance to meet with me.

Mark and Marija Zulu-Nyeko, its registrar and manager, have agreed and have agreed to share the money the bank received from the US$33,000,000.00 USD ($35,000,000.00) dollars commission from a fund Sale to be held in South Africa in June,2000 to be attended by Mr. and Mrs. Barry Kelly, which I had an agreement to share amongst ourselves.The funds was received in a suitcase, which I had an agreement to share amongst us, which is the US$33,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million, fifty seven Thousand United States Dollars). The funds were a result of a money transfer fraud that my late father, the former head of state of Zimbabwe, Mr. Morris Thompson, made, which amounted to, (a)taking money from a foreign clientele and (b)delivery of the money to a bank account that is not his, but a local partner made, to hide the true financial picture of the money. Therefore, the amount in question has been paid to the partner of the fraud to make him a partner with and to allow him to pass the money to his family members so as to avoid detection and confiscation. The funds has been tranfered to a bank in the United Kingdom, where it is being kept as a deposit. The funds is now safely the disbursement of the partner's share and the total amount involved is US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million, fifty seven Thousand United States Dollars). The bank has released the money to the partner to his name, but the partner is afraid to take his share, so he has requested for a business which is to obtain a new overseas account and/or to transfer the money to a financial institution overseas with his preferred bank account, since the money is no longer safe and reliable, and the bank has revoked his address and the company he is involved with as partners to the fraud. The partner is afraid of his share and he has also lost confidence in the justice of the whole business; furthermore, he has lost all his international business dealings since the recent developments. The bank has also declared the non-payment of his total commission to his late partner, which amounts to the sum of US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million, fifty seven Thousand United States Dollars). It was therefore upon this discovery that I and my three co-workers decided to seek a foreign partner overseas who will assist in the transfer of the money and possibly transfer the partner's share to his account overseas. The money and our share is presently in a bank account in another country where we hope to invest it. The only option we have to pursue is to seek asylum in another country where we will transfer the money and invest it in a profitable business venture. In the light of all these factors, we cannot release the money unless your assistance is specifically sought for. The information about the legal owner of the account, which I have on file with the information and demands, which is why I have contacted you. I have carefully examined all relevant documents to locate the PRIVATE PERSON who can assist me in the transaction and do not wish to embarrass their trust in me. I am prepared to offer you 25% of the total money for your assistance and counsel. If you are willing to assist, contact me immediately via above email address &lt;mailto:markandmarija@myway.com&gt; for further details on how we can accomplish this. Please confirm your best regards to my family by responding to this email address:markandmarija@myway.com&gt; Note: Also note that your urgent response and cooperation is highly required as the transaction cannot be concluded until I receive your response. With regards, Mark and Marija Zulu-Nyeko. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail sur i-mode� : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre  téléphone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/hotmailimode/

I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. My name is Mr. Sir Omari Moyo, the account officer to a deceased customer, a Norwegian with monies totaling USD31,000,000 (Thirty  Million United States Dollars) Inviolable which I have deposited in a commercial bank here in Cotonou-Benin for irreversible daily business investment. The customer was an oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Government of the Benin (George Atte) whose full name was Anson Ngoi. Before his death, he deposited this money with my branch bank here in Cotonou for safe keeping until he next of kin coming from as far as Nigeria or Senegal. He also had money deposited with two other banks and last but not least, he had a trunk money deposit valued at Thirty Million United States Dollars only with my branch bank here in Cotonou-Benin which he deposited with the note balance of the money amount Thirty Million United States Dollar (US$31M).  Upon maturity, the money was sent to the bank for further examination and verification but no one has come to claim it and I am afraid that the Federal Government might confiscate his money if anyone is found to have done so before his death. I therefore want the bank to release the money to his heirs/guardians.The money amount Thirty Million United States Dollars is what he had deposited in the bank for the safety and success of the deposit, but I want absolutely the bank to continue to offer me 20% of the money which he deposited in their name as his family account,while 5% has been set aside for expenses and the remaining 70% will be for myself and I.  Please, I want you to assist me in every possible way.I have two options for you. Either you will take 50% of the money or I will give you a list of all the expenses that I have incurred in the course of this transaction. Either you will give me your direct telephone/fax number for easy communication and you will also help me in the logistics of the transaction.  My mother used to advise me to treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and secrecy. I will gladly give you the details of the transaction if you insist. I have two alternatives for you. If you wish to take the 50% and go with me to Chad,you can do so under the Dubai Airways Sapphire Preferred Program. I will gladly pay all the expenses that you will incure here in my country in the course of the transaction. If you are interested, please get back to me immediately. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free. I have been and will continue to be indebted to you for this assistance to  me and hope that you will not disappoint me. I cannot wait to hear from you. Thanks and God bless.  Yours Faithfully, Mr. OMARI Moyo

The Board of Directors hereby:                                                                                                                                           
 
====================
We were really looking forward to having a formal business relationship with you and we really hope you will be able to help us.I want to first of all explain my situation. I am the credit officer of the branch here in Orania Vicenza, Vicenza, Italy. I am the only son of late Mr and Mrs,Barry Igen. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan, The Economic Capital of Ivory Coast, The Economic Capital of Ivory Coast, but unfortunately his business interests have now been seized by the authorities, and he is not allowed to leave the country, so he has decided to leave the country and find a reliable foreign partner who can assist him to transfer the money he accumulated towards the firm's account abroad before he is seized again. The money he accumulated in the bank seems to me to be a very fortune, so I am seeking for a reliable partner who will help to relocate the money and also to offer a safe bank account where the money will be transferred to. I shall be able to come over to your country to positively act as his partner for the transfer of the money. However, I want you to have three things in mind. Firstly, as soon as we hear from you, we shall be able to conclude and put in motion a productive business relationship. Secondly, we shall be helpful in resolving any financial disputes between the two of us, which may arise between us during the transfer process. Lastly, I want you to assist me in finding a reputable and safe foreign partner, who will assist me in the transfer of the money to your account. I look forward to your quick response. Thanks and God bless as I wait for your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, Barry Igen.

Cape Town South Africa Dear -                                                                                                                     I am Mr.gonzalo sanandarici,the account officer of the late Mr.John McClure who died in a ghastly air crash with his family that occurred in Kenya, western Africa with the whole passenger�s family and everybody on his—s extended family having disappeared without a [heir] . My late client had about $6,000,000 [Six Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] deposited with my name as the account officer . The money was meant for his presidential campaign and party. But unfortunately, all his supposed supposed agents and goverment officials have been killed or fled the country.  [According to this article in the Dutch newspaper, the Dutch government is prepared to sell off most foreign assets to fund the presidential campaign of Sen.Jacob Zuma,  an ally to the late Mr.John McClure.

I am Mr.Vincent, I work for the Federal Ministry of the Interior and I am responsible for coordinating the spending of the over-inflated sum of $15,500,000.00(Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been deposited in our bank during the last military regime.  From the above biography, you would expect me to be an honest and trustworthy person that would not want another foreign client, so I have selected you to be my foreign client because the former client, Mr. Alhaji Saif Alhaji, was a foreigner and he did not want his money to be seized by a local person.  However, as the manager of the account, I have all secret details and necessary contact for  transfer of the fund smoothly into your nominated account in Europe.  As a matter of fact, I could have done this transaction alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, I am not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow that will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the bank and also present a foreign account where he/she will need the money to be re-transferred into on his or her request as the case may be.  For you to assist me in this transaction, you will only need to furnish me with your full names, address, and telephone/fax so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.  After the transfer has been effected, the total amount will be US$15,500,000.00(fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  As it is, I am ready to share the money with you as the next of kin but I will only give you the information and address needed to put you in place as the next of kin.  I want you and my family to be very educated on all sides as to staying out of trouble, because we will find ourselves in quite a mess if we do this deal alone.  I have a  safe deposit account opened with the bank and I will use my position and influence to get a very good arrangement done on the account to enable us to withdraw the money from Europe, South America, or Australia for investment purposes.  If you are really sure of your trustworthy and accountability to me, I will like you to contact me through my email address on the above email address address which is also my telephone and fax number, that is:  paul0408@fastermail.com so that I can send you more information about the transaction.  For your information, this is a real deal and it is done. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% Risk Free and if you are willing and ready to take care of it, then this is a great opportunity for you. Please, I will appreciate it very much if you can get me a reliable foreign partner that will assist me in this transaction. For that, I will appreciate a very good understanding with your personal Tel/Fax number and Email address.  For you to assist me, I need your assistance to get $5,000,000.00 including bank account into your nominated account. I do need your blessing to put this fund into a Local bank account of your choice so that the money will not get into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. Please, you have to do this deal for me. It is my honour to work for the Federal Government of Canada.  I will appreciate it very much if you can receive this fund into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. The remaining 10% will be for any expenses that might be incured during the course of this transaction.  Please, I will give you details about the account to be used for this deposit when I hear from you again. I do need your assistance because this business is real and serious. I am looking forward to hearing from you soonest, so call me as soon as possible. Thank you and God bless you.  Mr. Vincent J. Botta

From Haloskala, Iceland

Dear Friend, Glad to have a short business interview with you. First off, I am the financial manager of  the International Commercial Bank Ltd United West Africa. I have been mandated by the Board of Directors to  solicit for a foreign partner scheme bank abroad who can assist us in the provision of a  branch abroad, and also the establishment of a bank account abroad for  that purpose. It may interest you to know that in July of 1999, a gold merchant/contractor for the Bristol Gold Corp. , Mr. Peter Crive made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$29,000,000.00 (Twenty-  million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Bristol Gold Corp. that Mr. Peter Crive died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Crive did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$29,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the South Iceland Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Iceland Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Peter Crive, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you while 5% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. The rest 10% will be for myself and my partners for investment in any profitable business. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards,  Mr. Robert F. Nathan.

Apex Bank of India,Ltd. (ABN) is pleased to inform you that you have been designated a customer of the bank. This arrangement is known to you and my junior colleague, who are also in the position of the bank to do us some social service by making a mutually profitable transaction with you and still leave enough money for us to invest in your country. This means if I meet with you and agree to assist me and also you meet my personal standards,as a woman, I am almost obligated to offer you this deal. This is simple, I will like you as a woman to take charge of a transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account where it will be safe, secured and tax free.  This money was incurred from some over invoiced commission which the late dictator of Angola, on his birth,was paid by the French Government to his entire family. The money was paid to my junior colleague late PLOTF ASIN FEE who was also MY BROTHER IN LAW, but he was murdered in the crisis that was supposedly onthe rise in the country.  Since then the government of Angola has been trying to claim the money and after several unsuccessful attempts,the government announced the first of his peers would be personally paid for by the government. The government has also frozen all known assets of my junior colleague including properties, bank accounts and money. But nothing will ever be the same to him because he was due to receive his payment in person.  As a result of all these they have made me and my senior colleague, who are now in the country, to look for a foreign partner to carry out this deal.  We are looking for a partner that will help us to invest in a profitable business with the money we will make with the money we make with the money we have in the total amount of the contract and will help us acquire new assets. Before the death of my senior partner on the 8th of February 2001 in a mysterious plane crash that devastated his house and his office, he had a document that he deposited with the bank in which he made a deposit of USD 42,000,000.00 (Forty two million dollars) for this mutual investment with you. The deposit was for a factory which he was going to build in the neighboring country. This money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the factory. This is an alleged transaction log of the foreign customers with our bank.  The federal government has issued licenses to the businesses, powers and agencies to seize their assets. My cabinet colleagues have called me to the table for a meeting to discuss on how to shift the balance of this money into an account outside our country which will help to invest it.  This is my wish and hope in you and I hope you will not betray the trust I have bestowed on you to execute this transaction. My colleagues have agreed to share the money and leave the country in the best of form. They have all agreed to remain anonymous.  The money will be deposited in a private security company for safe keeping. The money will be paid to their legal and/or bank account by our finance ministry, through the Interstate Financing Authority. The money will only be accessible to the members of the same family. All documents to make the deposit will be ready with the necessary paperwork. This money will be maintained in the private security company pending when the money will be paid into their account from the finance ministry. This money will be paid into your account in the private security company as soon as the money is moved into your account.   This is simple to confirm:  * The private security company will transport the money to your bank account through a private security firm that is reliable and fit for the job. This money will be paid to your bank account through the local money transfer office of our finance ministry. I have examined the efficiency of the private security company and all the transaction. My colleagues and I are ready to go into a joint venture business venture agreement with you and also into a joint venture with you can recommend a good company that you can develop together as you help to invest the money into a profitable business venture. We are ready to go into a business partnership with you to see a successful conclusion of this transaction. Please, you have been advised to keep "top secret" as the agreement between us is very confidential and all communication to and from you must be by fax or phone. Yours truly, V.S. NELSON. NEW YORK CLOSE

Note: This message to you may come to you as a surprise, since you don't know me. I wish to inform you that I have absolutely no idea you and I, are related. Actually, I don't even know the person you are interacting with today.  However, I feel strongly that sharing this information about me, does not hurt anyone. I am, Amadou Diop, the son of late General Sani Diop, who was the President of the Federal Republic of Liberia (Federal Republic of Liberia) before his untimely death on the 21st of July, 2003. I was born into a slave/homosexual family and have no father or uncle. I am an only child and my mother has a very hard time raising me because there is no father around for me.  Before the death of my mother, she secretly called me on her bed side and told me that she has a package  containing millions of dollars dollars  in two safes in the safe keeping of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, South Africa. She said that she deposited this money on a private foreign exchange contract with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Atlanta, South Africa. She said that this money is the will of my late father and she needs my full support to transfer it over there to her. She also mentioned that she advised me to seek for a foreign partner who will help us transfer this money to his/her nominated bank account in Europe or America. Her late father used my name to Deposit the money in the Deposit/Account as the beneficiary of the money. She said that she deposited this money in the deposit because she knew that it would not pass into the bank treasury as a legacy.  She also mentioned that she advised that I seek for a partner who will help us transfer this money to his/her bank account in Europe or America. If you can not undertake this, then I will stay with you until I find a partner who will be right for this transaction. Then I will come over to your country and arrange for my own share of the money to be sent to her in your name. I don't need any phone communication in this transaction. If you don't want this money, you are free to exchange it for something else. However, I want you to send me your full contact information for the deposit: your full name, address, and telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication. I will give you all the details that I need for the deposit.  Thank you in advance as this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will need your assistance to invest in your country. Note: Please, do not disclose the contents of this mail to anyone except me.  I would also like you to keep this mail confidential. I am sure that you will not disappoint me. Thank you for your anticipated response. Thank you as you wait for the call. Sincerely,  Amadou Diop.

The money was meant for his family's projects when he was the next of kin to his late father. The funds was deposited with a security company. The funds was deposited as a crown deposit, monies, which is a fixed deposit, but it was for a project, which my late father was going to do, he deposited the money (US$26,000,000.00) as a crown deposit with the security company, so that they could release it to his family for safe keeping. The money is still in the security company, and my client is a foreigner, and so my client is a foreigner too. The next of kin will assist my client, and for his family to have access to the funds, my client will also assist his family to buy houses and part of his family to own houses. Due to this, the current government of Norway is making preparations to remove all his family, including his wife and only daughter to be next of kin to the late Barrie Weir.  It is my resolve as the lawyer that this letter to you should have a highly confidential and top secret nature, that I will not disclose the nature of this letter to any other person for security reasons. I will furnish you with all the information regarding the deposit deposit that will be of interest to you.

I am honourably seeking for your assistance in the following ways. (1) To provide a bank account into which this money will be transfer to. (2) To serve as a guardian of this money since I will not like to lose this money to someone else. (3) To make arrangement for this money to bail to a safe deposit with adequate security entrust to it to be moved out agains a reliable foreigner for his family investment in your country, which will also benefit you as a foreigner as well. (4) To make arrangement for this money to be transfer to your country, so that you can help me invest the money in a profitable venture. The money will be paid into the account of the security company without any part of it being traced back to my client.

Our Price: US$8,500,000.00Dollars net of reserve account fees, if any. This fund is a loan we have been attempting to transfer to a overseas account but with no success so far.

I have worked out a very good method of secure datagram internet based telex/telephone communication, which can be done only with our computers, which we have procured from the Internet. There is one thing to be aware of, as we are still in active service and intend to retire from service after our retirement from service.

The National Electronic  Conference (N.E.C) in Johannesburg,South Africa. My late father (assistant principal) was a very rich white farmer who was murdered by our opponents in the political power struggle that broke out in Zimbabwe after the death of president Robert Mugabe.The President's sister,wife and only daughter were murdered by these supporters of president Robert Mugabe. My late father's former private secretary and bank manager Mr. C.Z. Moyo and his wife (who were both murdered)  were the main instigators of this political violence that led to the death of my father and the exile of his family.  My late father was a fighter for Social Justice, which he believed in and preached to his people.  As soon as this violent and bloody dispute happened, a massive operation was launched by the white farmers in Zimbabwe to exterminate all the white farmers and turn  the country into an open plain where the white farmer could not farm and more and more white farmers were killed for their support to the president and his party members. My late father's private secretary and the  bank manager(s) arrived in ZIMBABWE to deposit the sum of US$13,500,000 (Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a private security  company for safekeeping.   Later, my late father's family were kidnapped and murdered by our opponents and most of his bank  account was frozen.  In fact, he had deposited this money (US$13,500,000.00) with a security company for safekeeping in South Africa because his  bank account was being used as an ATM by my government of South Africa to kill  all his enemies.   On further investigation, I found out that my late father did not leave any will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  futile.  In view, my late father intended this money to go into a trust fund for  his late school, university and charitable organizations for safekeeping without any  person knowing that this money was being dangled in a  trust fund for the government.   Because of this, he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official documents.    The total amount involved is (US$13,500,000.00 USD). The  total amount amount is (US$13,500,000.00 USD). The  total amount is (US$13,500,000.00 USD).    From the information I gathered about the circumstances of my late father's death, it  appears that he was murdered by my enemies on the one hand and that the  safe haven of abroad where this money is being deposited is a  hot spot for money to invest.   In view of this, it would seem that he wanted this money withdrawn urgently and  no person knows of the funds in the account.   The money is presently deposited in a security company here in South Africa for safekeeping, but I want  to get this money out to where it can be used for investment purposes,  such as real estate management or hotel management.   This is the reason why, I am writing you this letter. The funds (US$13,500,000.00) is  still in a security company abroad and  I would like you to help me repatriate this money and use it for  investment purposes, such as real estate management or hotel management. I  have concluded a deal with a person who is willing to give me the account where the  money is to transfer it to your account in a profitable and  profitable manner.      It is not a bank-to bank transfer. All that is required from you  immediately upon your response will be your full-name, address  and your private telephone/fax number. I will pay you the money    earned from the account each month for the next ten (10) years. To  enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you, I will require your   deposit number, which you can provide, which will then enable me to make   the contact information for the bank where the money will be transfered. The   money will be paid into your account until we come out   together with the money in the account to be shared in the ratio of 60%   for me, 35% for you and 5% for any expenses. The   amount is thirty million dollars.  I am moving the fund to your account with out disclosing   any part of the money to you. I want a bank account that will    help us transfer this fund to you. If you are willing, I will give you all necessary   details of the account to be used for the transfer. I am awaiting your reply immediately to my   phone and fax number so that you can reach me   immediately. Kindly reply me to, above, Yours sincerely, MR. JANET Z.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay an order of the Court of Audit to release the money that the Bank of Scotland deposited with the BankName before the war in 1953.The depositor in question was a company of which he was the manager and the deposit was valued at about thirty million pounds when the money was first deposited.

On Tuesday, 23rd July, 2000, an American contractor with the Government of Nigeria, Mr. Randy K. Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,000,000.00 (Twenty-six Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Petroleum that Mr. Randy K. Williams died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Randy K. Williams did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$26,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Randy K. Williams,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 83% for me and 28% for you. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested,please reply immediately. I will submit to you an application form which will guide the Bank to approve the transfer to your account. I will give you all the information needed to apply for the transfer.  You should observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following below to enable me start the processing of the transfer to your account: 1. Your full Name and address. 2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers. 3. Your Bank Name, Address, and Telephone and fax numbers. I am waiting for your response so that I can send you the payment instructions so that you send me your private information for the forms to fill and the bank account information for the form to be sent to the bank. Thank you and God bless you as you reply immediately. Yours truly, Mr. Frank v. brends.

email-lou_hughes@netscape.net Dear Friend, My name is Mr. Fredrick Sanko, I am the Executive Manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. I am writing following a kind of business consultancy my department has done for a foreign client who desires a safe haven account for a development project. The development project is a major renovation and facelift of a prime prime residential property in the possition of which the late president (OF MALCOM YOLDIN was the project manager) of the country, Mr. Peter Odey, made a long time money while at the command of his late brother, Mr. Algiers (OF MALCOM YOLDIN). The property which has been made into a memorial by the late President for the past two centuries was paid for with the money the government has on deposit, as an unclaimed payment. The property has since been declared non-operational and the owner of the property, Mr. Peter Odey, died, leaving nobody behind for the claim. The property is located in the town of VARO in the north east of Nigeria and is an abandoned property. The owner of the property, Mr. Peter Odey, is a foreigner and an oil millionaire. He was a businessman and a politician who was that controlled by a small group of rich war veterans who wanted to take over the government. In the course of carrying out their business plan they decided to divide the money kept in the account and left the money in the account even though they knew that after the death of the late president (OF MALCOM YOLDIN) they would run out of money. The money which the government have left in the account is what they will use to strengthen their grip on the territory they want to claim. To achieve this, they have seized all our foreign bank accounts. What we want from you is for us to present ourselves as a reputable company, a bank , that will help us recieve the money and also provide a safe haven account for the money we intend to use for investment in a private or public business venture. In the course of this process, we have already secured the property as a memorial out of the money and are now in the process of establishing a new life there with the money. The property owners have agreed to give us 20% of the money while the remaining 70% is for our investment in a private or public business.  We have secured all the necessary documents to back up any claim. Please, if you are interested to work with us, provide the following information: 1) Your full name and address. 2) Your private telephone and fax numbers. 3) Your bank name, address, and Telephone numbers.  We are assuring you that this transaction is 100% risk free and legal. We are at the stage now where the attorney and the bank are waiting for your response so we can finalize the application for the money to  be shared between the two of us in the following manner:" You will serve as the bank's next of kin. The Bank will have the authority to  issue you a new bank account where the money will be transferred to your name. The amount we are going to require from you is your most up-to-date bank account information including your bank  address, telephone and fax number. The more up-to-date information you provide, the sooner the bank will receive your  information and begin the work of transferring the money to your nominated account. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of  50% for me and 70% for you while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that may be incured during the  transaction. There is no risk involved in the transaction.  The money will be transferred to your account in the following manner: The money will be transferred into an account that will be provided by you for legal  reasons, until my husband's death in a ghastly car crash on October 31, 2000. I will also provide you with a new telephone and fax number for the  security of the transaction. Please, I want you to have no doubt in the integrity of the transaction. I need your assistance to get this transaction off the ground.  I am expecting your urgent response for us to proceed to the next level. As soon as I get your positive response, I shall give you more details about the need and my desire for your assistance. I will also advise you on what you can do for the mutual benefit of both of us. As soon as I hear from you again, I will give you the call signal number so that you can call to schedule the next transfer. Best regards and God bless you. My regards and regards, Mr. Fredrick Sanko.

His reply was the best thing that happened to me today. He literally wrote me an email and called me, he said that he had an account with a bank in known 1) Country in 2) Continent and that I should look for another country to do business with that it funds to invest in. I just gave him the deposit slip and told him that I would come over to his country to collect the funds but on my arrival in his country, i proceeded to deposit the deposit slip with the bank, he told me to come over to his country and he would transfer all the money to his account in his country. He charged me with theft and he advised me to withdraw the money from the bank before he will release it to his new account. But, he did not reveal the progress of the deposit slip till we parted company. He deposited the sum of US$5.3M (Five Million,three Hundred Thousand United States Dollar) in a private security firm vault in Hyderabad,India to avoid detection and confiscation. I have been seeking for assistance from you to render the depositing of and transfer of this money to your account in overseas private security company to receive this money for investment.

The funds deposited with the NGO's representative agency had an amount of $15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars). I have no idea how they managed to do that but I am willing to give them a chance. The representative promptly excaied the money to his travel agency which I will be using to move out of here to Europe. The funds will be released to you and the NGO's representative in Europe who will deal with this issue with the documentation to receive this money when it gets to you.For security reasons, please reply me on the following email, Sunday Joseph@juno.com for more information.

BANGKOK – A member of the Commission on Foreign Investment (C.E.I) has issued a notice to the above-named bank to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the bank within a reasonable period of time.The original complaint/questions about the above-named bank involved amount to our area's maximum balance of US$8.3M (Eight Million,Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). We therefore made further investigation and discovered that the above-named bank in which the above amount was deposited (US$8.3M) has no known or any last name written on the certificate of deposit. We further investigated further and discovered that the owner of the account is a foreigner (A man with a full name not known to us). The total amount involved is ( Eight million,Three hundred Thousand United States Dollars). We therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account is a scam/money grabber and all known contacts of the account holder have all been lost. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that the account holder is a scammer. He deposited the sum of US$8.3M (Eight Million,Three hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a private security company which was a couriers company and a deposit company in Bahia-Burkina-Faso Member State. The said amount was paid to the security company by the late head of state of Cote d'ivoire, Prince Charles. He used my name as the next of kin to deposit the money to a consignment with in a consignment with security company as the beneficiary and the money was meant for the purchase of ammunition and other war and stabilizing medicines for his country.The money was all hidden in a consignment with security company where it was supposed to be stashed for a long time and secured in a vault for a long time pending when he will visit my country. The money was then deposited in a private security company where I am the consignment officer and the money was waiting to be paid to the security company account for the security of the account by the new head of state of Cote d'ivoire, Prince Charles. The money was supposed to last for a year and a half, from the date when he ordered the money to be paid to the security company account since the money will last for a long time before it can be paid to a bank account for onward distribution to any non-essential partner. The money was deposited in these consignment accounts from cote d'ivoire and I will visit your country to collect my share as soon as the security company account has been paid to the security company account of the security company operator.

AUSTRALIAN SPORTING OIL COMPANY(ASX) In October 2005, an oil consultant/contractor with the Government of Australia, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in one of the  foreign account of my client, the then private Governor General of Singapore, Mr. Robert Menzies. Upon maturity, the account was  subsequently forwarded to the Treasury as unclaimed Fund. When I probed the account, I discovered that the account has been dormant for the last fourteen years with no  claim of the fund in our custody. The account has no other beneficiary and until he died he was the head of the Government-owned Singapore Investment Company,  the Executives' Bank of Singapore. All the banking and financial details for this account, were executed by me. The account has no other beneficiary and he was the Executives' Bank of Singapore. The Banking Council of Singapore, has since 2005 issued a notice to the Government of Singapore to furnish any of the following  by their next of kin or else be considered a "NSA" (Notary Public) to the dead beneficiary and if the beneficiary is not a "NSA" (Notary Public) to the government, he must have been a foreigner. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the deceased beneficiary is not a "NSA" (Notary Public) and to this effect, his name is not even on the  approved banking list. I have since decided to redo the entire account so that the money will be released to the "NSA" (Notary Public)  when the person is finally claimed. The amount involved is (US$25,000,000.00) Twenty-five Million Dollars. All modalities for the transfer of this funds have been worked out and once the funds are channeled into your account, it will be transferred to any bank account that you will provide  for the remittance of this money.  I will first transfer US$5,000,000.00 (Five Million US dollars) to your account  before the rest. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for the release of the  money to your account. The money will be paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. The money will be paid into your account as the  beneficiary. If you are not willing to assist, then kindly search  on your own to find a trustworthy foreigner who will assist you. I will also like you to furnish me with your bank account information  where the money will be transfered into. I want the total amount of the transfer to be US$25.000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million United States Dollars) plus any accrued interest. The money will be transferred to any nominated bank account of your choice  where the money will be safely keep. I do expect your urgent reply. Best Regards. Mr. Barry Kelly.

By his report, the fund has been dormant in his account for over a year, the report states. The account was opened in 1995 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files, I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of the account is the chairman of the investment committee of the bank and he died without a [heir]. The owner of the account is a foreigner and a Dane, and the Dane has no legal claim over this money. If you have any part of this money, you shall  immediately give  me into your house as next of kin to the deceased, otherwise I will destroy  your house immediately. The money will be paid into your account as an investment account. You can prove that you are the real owner of the account by providing your bank account address.

A manhunt is under way for a Japanese national wanted for questioning in Australia on numerous fraud charges. The Australian Federal Government has extended diplomatic relations to Japan and consignment of the funds seized by the Japanese Government during the course of their anti-Japanese unrest may be released to the Japanese Government for compensatory disbursement. The victim in this case is a Japanese member of parliament, the late Mr. James A.A.Lambert, who died in a mysterious air crash [Feb. 9, 1997] with his family. The funds seized by the Japanese Government is 30% of the total sum of $70M (70M  US Dollars). The funds are presently under the watch of the Australian Government. I am being extremely cautious, so I would like you to assist me with the transaction  which will be most beneficial to both of us. My main concern is the safety of my personal and family now that this deal is final and I do not want this money to get into the hands of some corrupt officials. I would also want this money to be released to the Japanese Government for compensatory disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Please I want you to keep all this information confidential as I am still in active government service and intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal. The deal is 100% risk free and innocent until proven guilty is proven innocent. I have searched all over the world for a reliable and honest person to assist me in this transaction but all suggestions and assistance given to me is appreciated most of all. I am keeping this information secret as a matter of principle as the security and safety of this transaction is my number one concern. I will give you all the details as to how we intend to use this money. This money will be paid to your credit card through the secured banking system of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money is not paid to you in full within the next ten (10) working days, the money will be transferred to the account of the deceased foreigner partner who paid for the airway to leave the country. The money will be paid into your account until you confirm the money in your account. As soon as I hear from you, I will give you all the contact details of the attorney who will prepare the document and letter of proof that will back up the claims of the deceased partner. Please be advised that this is a one time deal and I will not be expecting any kind of a return from you. I will also tell you the name of the attorney who will prepare the letter of proof that will back up the claims of the deceased partner. I will be using my own name for the first time in this deal for the security and safety of the whole deal as the attorney will not want the information to get into the hands of any kind of corrupt officials. God bless you as you humbly ask for it. Meanwhile, please treat this email as Top Secret. Yours in the name of God. Yours faithfully, Edward Kazumi.

(AFP) -

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has no intention of providing concessional  loans to Nigerians for defaulter  countries projects, but a concessional loan may be granted to a  foreign partner who has a similar credit rating to the IMF  but who is not related to the fund  issuer.The Fund's Director General, Christine Lagarde,  has decided to make this proposal to you and the names of the  partners has been  cleared for grant.The request of  a foreign partner for a refund of a debt contracted for  by a fund issuer has been made to the IMF and all relevant  documents have been furnished to the fund  issuer. The request of a foreign partner for a concessional loan is occasioned by  the fact that the partner country is a  member of the G-8 and the debtor country is a non-member G-8.The request of a foreign partner  for a refund of a debt signed after the date of payment is occasioned by  the fact that the partner country is a  member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the debtor country is not a Commonwealth country.As a matter of fact, the above  paragraph was formulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria and is approved by  the Ministry of Finance.The  Federal Government has set aside the sum of US$17,500,000.00 (ELEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND)  for allowing the partners of 1. David Georget to come over and claim the fund  after which the Bank has already lodged bills from the account  originally opened by the   partners. The above said amount is 22,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  which we intend to use for investment purposes, namely, real estate,  hotels,  boutiques,  investment  and to buy new  motor homes and   commercial properties. However, we are not interested  in any of those investments, we  only want to own  a hotel for our lives. The above said amount IS  the total sum the partners have agreed to give us, the   partners have agreed to share the sum of 15%   for us and 70% for the investors, while the remaining 10%   will be for any expenses that the partners might incure during the   time of the transaction. For personal reasons, we hav end up staying in residence rather    than going out to the country for the benefit of money so that we can invest here in a   country that we will both be safe and secure. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has already decided to  take all our investment property, including the hotel   and has frozen our account. It will be very simple for the Federal Government to allow us to come over to their country  to live in separate accounts to be used for the rest of the   years investment. We can always contact our local bank to transfer   the money into any account that we will like and the Bank will not even know we are not   from the same country. We have been living in an international safe haven in my country where we have   secured 10% of the total amount for any expenses that might occur during  the time of the transaction. We have secured the deposit with a security   company that is not bound by any other country's foreign deposit laws and regulations and can   freely transfer and withdraw the money from any account in this Country at anytime and without   any delay.

The money in question is a deposit of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million United States Dollars), which we have secretly kept in a bank in Europe to be invested in real estate and private equity business, when we came over here to deposit the money, we buried the deposit and moved the deposit to a safer vault for storage with the bank here in Europe. The money is not an illegal  deposit, but we would not like you to disclose the deposit to anybody else for security reason. The money has now been deposited in a safe vault for safe keeping with the bank here in Europe without the knowledge of the deposit holder, who is no where to be found now. I and my colleagues in the bank are now seeking your assistance to remit the money into your bank account in Europe, because the money has been deposited and the money is no where to be seen, as the money has been deposited and hidden, which is why we need your assistance in moving the money into your account. The money will be paid into your account as a grant to you by the bank, after which the money will be deposited in your account for immediate investment purposes, such as real estate and private equity business. The money will be paid to you as a loan, which you will help with investments in the banks and private equity business in Europe, as we have inform you that both entities are going into investment with the money. The money will be paid into your account as soon as we are ready to give it to you. I do need your assistance to provide your bank account information for the remittance because the bank is ready to approve the remittance to any foreigner's account which you are going to appoint for the deposit of the money,which is why you need the information. You may also change the amount in the amount required to obtain the approval for the amount of money you will help us secure and the security which you will provide for the investment in your account will be given to you by my partners. We are ready to offer you 20% of the money for your assistance and equity in the investments in your account, as soon as your information is received, after which your fund in your account will be released to you as soon as you receive the information from the bank about the money in your account. I will also advise you that your safety and the security of the money (your sharing of this money) is of paramount importance as we are ready to make any possible investment there, as we have informed the bank that my partners and I are ready to make any financial investment in your country which you are going to nominate for us as we are utmost professionals in the bank.

So I decided to write to you, for an urgent cooperation.  The site is www.watanabe.com and you can  click on the link below to view the site in its entirety.  http://www.watanabe.com/

While I share your concerns, I feel that it is best if we wait until we meet face to face. I sincerely ask for your assistance to provide me with a reliable and secure bank account for a deposit of US$35,000. 000 (Thirty Million US dollars). This money was a grant of   a life time bond in a multi-national company by former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mobutu Sese-Seko. This bond was issued to us by the   government of President Charles Taylor for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations. The original issue date of this bond is   2002.The original   holder of this bond,General Sani Abacha, became the President of   Republic of Benin through a   political assassination.Since the death of President Charles Taylor, the   government has been making good efforts to locate any of his   supporters. My suggestion to you is that I offer you 20% of the 20-million-united states   dollars and you will have the remaining 80% for investing in your name. So, Please, you will as well give me your information if you are interested. I am waiting for your response. Thank you, and God bless. Yours sincerely, Mr. Kenny William.

Exclusive: The Future of Iraq Will be Made Available to you By My New D.P.C (Mrs. Suha Aisha Mohammed) [from Iraq] Dear Friend, Let me apologize for this mail, but I am not sure if you will come to my assistance for a mutually beneficial transaction. I am Mrs. Suha Aisha Mohammed, the wife to the late General Sani Sani Ali Mohammed of the Iraqi forces who was murdered by the Mujahedeen in Iraq. My Husband was a highly placed officer and he was the legal guardian of my late husband and he had intended to transfer our family policy to another country as he was about to die of a heart attack. His Holiness The Iraqi Senior Minister for Foreign Holdings who was with him when the body was carried out visited us in exile in Iraq 5 days before his death and offered us refuge in his country for the money he deposited in them.I declined his offer and informed him that this family money would be returned to the family treasury as unclaimed after the next of kin has been seen. This policy prevailed from the new Iraqi President to the entire government has declared Iraq as a blow back state and all government officials have been ordered to leave there country. My Husband told me that he deposited the sum of US$20,000,000 (Twenty Million two hundred thousand United States Dollars) on a Canadian-American Private Security company vault in Israel, to keep the money secret until he dies but I am afraid he will not see the money later on because he has been killed in the conflict in Iraq. The next of kin to my husband has been promised by the government of Iraq that if they do not give the money to them, it will be donated to some foreign  non-state  entity like charity organization as unclaimed after the next of kin has been seen, they will be compelled to transfer the money to Iraq for later use in Iraq. We are not aware that the government of Iraq will honor our order of the Minister to dispose of the money to any foreign person. I have attempted to contact the hotel from where he was staying but all my efforts failed. I therefore decided to search for a reliable person to offer the money to the government of Iraq for disbursement but I was informed that the money will be declared to the hotel management and not to me. I was making my last preparations before I left for a trip to Iraq. To make the next of kin of my late husband presentable and trustworthy I have contacted the private security firm to be used to protect the family. This is the full story. If you agree please forward the following information to me as the next of kin: your full name, address, and telephone/fax.You will be considered to have made an agreement with me.I will also like to give you a call number so that you can reach me. Please it is important that there be no ambiguity in the translation as to means and application of the fund.As it may interest you to know, I am presently staying with my family in one of the safe houses  here in Georg bank for security and safety reasons because our family is politically sensitive in this part of the world. The money I intend to use for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals companies and also for the start of a new business in  the pharmaceutical industry from where our children will inherit our father's business. As of now, the family is living on the money I deposited in the factory. I have contacted the  Bank where the money will be remitted and they are not aware that the money is  being deposited for security and safety reasons. I have also mentioned to them that this is a money that my late husband intended to use for an investment in a profitable business. All I want is for them to release the money to anyone who has correct information of the account with my bank without any delay as to when the money will be payed to the account holder. I am waiting in anticipation of your urgent response to this letter. Reply urgently with the new email address in my list so that I will give you more details. And whatever you need to know to facilitate the immediate transfer of the fund to your account, I will give to you. Thank you and God bless. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Suha Aisha Mohammed.

To apply for this position, you must first apply for a non-immigrant visa. After which you will apply for the visa on your behalf to the Embassy or Consulate where the bank will process the payment and confirm the payment into your account. The amount of the payment will be the  total amount of the contract payment plus accrued interest. In short, the more interest you incur, the more interest you will pay.   As soon as I receive your payment, I will forward your information,

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday approved the transfer of some $22.7 million to Turkey as part of a long-running aid project, in a move that Turkey hopes will encourage it to help it in settling old debts and help it to grow its economy. The funds were accumuwed in two accounts from 1982 to 1999, when the current president of Turkey, General Abdullah Gül, took power. The funds are currently stored in a private security and finance company in Turkey. The amount involved is 22.7M euros. Some of the money has been transferred to a foreign account, while others has been declared "UN-RESERVABLE" and demanded a payment immediately. Turkey has demanded the immediate transfer of the remaining balance of $22.7M to Turkey. The EU has agreed to pay this balance to Turkey, but the money still lies under the control of the Security and Finance Company and the date of payment has been pushed back to later this year. A joint venture was concluded last year between the EU and Turkey, but the agreements of the past 50 years are not renewed. Last year, the Turkish government banned all Western pension companies and financial institutions in Turkey from operating accounts. The banking law enforcement agency (Bolivian Federal Police) has been set up to regularly monitor all bank accounts in Turkey in an attempt to locate any of the late general's family members. Because the EU/NATO agreement does not allow any person to own more than $10,000,000 (Ten million dollars), the total sum of the outstanding funds of the former Turkish government from 1982 to 1999 belongs to Turkey, and the depositing bank account of the late general. This sum of US$22.7M is the sum of what is left over after interest and tax paid on the money and the assets of the late general have been frozen by the Turkish government. Because of the current economic difficulties in Turkey, the old man is no longer in any condition of working, and he is not allowed any financial benefit (residential house, car, airplane tickets, vacation tickets). Because of the situation, his family members are trying to get him to move out of Turkey but they are having no success. We therefore decided to seek for a reliable foreign partner abroad who will assist us in moving the total sum of the outstanding funds in the account to a safe account abroad. A reliable foreign partner should assist us in securing a property and financial investment in your country, which will benefit both of us. This agreement therefore was forged with the purpose of establishing a property and financial investment in your country. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction, your share will be 15% of the total amount, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe and secure, on your part provided you act correctly. I have been allowed to visit your country frequently during the Contract term  of the project. You can contact me on my direct line No 10  865 6226664, from where I am bound on telephony and email; this is my email address. Alternatively you can contact me through my alternative email address; konkonkon@consultant.com as  indicated above. Thanking you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

As you may know by now, the PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY is a very political party that does not meet very often. This has been very much on cause of the ongoing and unjust war against the Christians in Nigeria by the Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo that is led by members of his own family. I have described in detail some of the horrible crimes being committed by the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo against the Christian community in Nigeria. I have also described how my late father has been murdered by my late father's killers because of this war that my father and I (my family) have waged against the corrupt government.

To put an end to this current situation, I decided to contact you to be an adviser to  me because my immediate family (my partners and I) are currently in the country to assist me to transfer  money and accrue property investment into the country.      My late father Mr.Jim Clark a Gold and Coking merchant D.B. No 67, Lagos Colony was recently murdered in my fathers blood by his business associate Mr. Robert Snr Maile (who was both poisoned and murdered by their families prior to the execution of these business deals) which left my father (Asamblem) bloodied and maimed. To make matters worse, my late father's business partner and business manger Mr. Robert Snr Maile (a banker) who was also a member of the Zimbabwean Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZCCI) was also murdered by his late father for having supported the President, Robert Mugabe   (whom they also called me father) before he was poisoned by his business associates. Before my father's death he had deposited the sum of US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million US dollars) with a private security firm, where he had deposited this money as family valuables. This money was deposited as family valuables and the family will leave this sum unclaimed if it is not moved out of the family cemetery.                         This amount is 20% of the total amount being paid into the account by the depositor(Our client).

However,I am willing to offer someone out of the bank a 50% share of the total sum for his assistance,while 5% will be set aside for any expences incured during the transfer process,while 65% will be for myself and my late wife.I do need to stress that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free.

5 Threads  From: Mr. Robert Kone, Desh Childrens Home,Haggar-Hill, 3rd Floor, N.N.Hong Kong. Dear Sir/Madam,  I am Mr. Robert Kone , the Director in charge of auditing and accounting section of the Hong Kong branch of International Commercial Bank Ltd, (ICB). I have been expecting you to declare your bank account for the payment of the overdue child support charges on my late father's bank account which has been with my fathers department for a very long time. The account has a balance of $33,200,000.00 USD($33,200,000.00 US Dollars) which I have been patiently awaiting the obligation to declare to my husband, so that he can personally make the payment to the bank before the next of kin goes in to collect it.  In the course of his employment with my fathers department, my late father was regularly notified of the next of kin to his late employers who died leaving nobody behind for the claims on the account. The account has been dormant since the death of my father.  It is impossible for the account to be activated since nobody I know of has applied to claim the fund. I want you to clear this debt to my country before it gets into the hands of some corrupt officials who might try to claim it. I cannot go into details about this, so please do not disturb my work. As soon as I hear from you, I will let you know the next step to take. It will also clear up any blind spots in the account. Please note that this business is 100% risk and trouble free. It will not affect your financial security but it will certainly raise an eye brow on your side during the time of deposit since nobody is coming for it. I will apply for yearly leave to get visa immediately I hear from you again. If you accept to work with me, I will give you all the details to clear the account. If you cannot work with me, then you will deal with me as the primary provider of the account since I am the only one who understands the account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount, 55% will be for me, while 5% will be for all the expenses we make during the time of deposit. This is simple, I will like you to work with me for the next 6 months with the understanding that you will not exceed 30% of the total amount. The remaining 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses we make during the time of deposit. I look forward to your reply immediately. Thanks and God bless you. Yours truly, Mr. Robert Kone.

On Tuesday, 13th of February, 2000, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration and Production Company, Mr. Ted Roskam made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$169,500,000.00 (and could be used for investment). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration and Production Company that Mr. Ted Roskam died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Ted Roskam did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$169,500,000.00 is still sitting in Randgold and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of Randgold, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Randgold Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Ted Roskam,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Halliburton Company that Mr. Bertrand Barrett  died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Bertrand Barrett  did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,700,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the money. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Bertrand Barrett  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have a lawyer that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Bertrand Barrett  , which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of a lawyer for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A woman who claimed to be the first daughter of late Dr. Jim Smith,A minister and former mining magnate from Swaziland now living in Mega Island, Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast, Ivory Coast.I will confide in you for a change of this magnitude, and I sincerely crave your indulgence and pray you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Before the death of my father on 1st October 2002 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, He secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he deposited the sum of US$10.5 million (Ten million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in a private security company vault in Holland, and that he used my name as the next of kin to deposit this money in the security company vault. He also explained to me that it was because of this money that he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings to a conference in Holland, the final destination of the money he deposited in the security company vault. The money he deposited was the money his business partners used in offering him to their political opponents for the last campaign they organized in which they stole the presidency. By virtue of his status as a senior citizen he is not allowed to operate any bank account outside his country, so he sought a diplomatic solution and sought your assistance as his foreign partner to secure this money and move it to your country to relocate it and invest part of this money in your country. On the other hand, the political police of Ivory Coast are not very friendly to the Church and the idea is that I will have to move this money in a foreign security company vault for safekeeping for a while, while the money will be invested and used for political purposes in my country. I am worried that if I do not do this deal with you I will lose the money and be unable to claim it from the bank. As soon as I receive your response I will forward the required information to you. I will pay all the expenses you will incur as a result of this transaction. I will also offer you a nice percentage of this money as compensation for your effort after the successful transfer of the money to your account. Be assured that you will not be fooled by my intentions. I have secretly discussed this matter with a lawyer acquaintance who is arranging the necessary documents with the bank that will help you claim the money with legal claims. Please I want you to look for a trustworthy foreign business partner who will help me secure the proper security arrangements for the fund and that you will act as the next of kin to my late father in his banking business. If you are not interested please disregard this letter and move on to the next e-mail. At the conclusion of this business please send me a fax number for further discussion on obtaining the proper arrangements for the money. Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation. Yours sincerely. Mrs Maryam Abacha.

Aboriginal Affairs minister Alan Finkel was charged with 13 counts of Forex fraud , one of the main charges made by the supporters of my late father. The bank where he worked as an account officer was robbed and many valuable documents were stolen by the supporters of my father. I was his private secretary and the private secretary to my late father. I have sought and been able to secure the money with the assistance of a private attorney but have not been able to secure the money from the supporters without any problem. I have been trying to secure this money for the future of my family but I shall have to abandon the attempt because of the inability of the attorney to secure the money. My late father was a very wealthy gold merchant in European and American  economy and bank proprietor who was murdered by the supporters of my father who were protesting against the Federal  Government's policies in the economy and the Federal Government's  move to tax their profits and confiscate their investments.                                                                                                                   It is therefore upon this discovery that I now seek your assistance and hope to achieve a verifiable  transaction that would benefit both of us.

"I am Mr John Marshall, the Manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. I am contacting you in view of the fact that I may be of assistance to you in a transaction of this nature, I am about to transfer out $23,500,000.00 (Twenty three million five hundred thousand dollars) out of Cameroon into a safe account abroad. Perhaps you will be a good partner to me because you will understand my predicament and would also help me to invest the money I inherit in business. The money I inherited was paid to a deceased person as a beneficiary in a trust fund for the president of against a Communist government in my country. The money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for our farms and also for the construction of houses for our family. The government has seized all our bank accounts abroad and in my country we are not allowed to operate any bank account. Therefore, for the past 5 years my uncle has been living on the streets of cote d'ivoire waiting for his money to be released by the government. Last week the government arrested my uncle and seized his farm and bank account valued at about US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty five million dollars) and I have been living on the streets of cote dinor for the last 3 years in refugee camps in the world. I have lost my parents and no one knows of my presence in the refugee camps. Since I have been unable to visit my parents or any of my extended relatives for the past 3 years now, I am bear with you as of now to the refugees camp and have been confined there. I am a man of hope and I know that God will see you through. I have been made an Official turned refugee by the government of cote d'ivoire, in view of the fact that my organization "wants" the money to be released, I need your assistance to relocate out of the refugee camps in the world. Please, I do need your assistance to have the money to relocate out of the refugee camps in the world but I will give you a good report of the money when I hear from you. I do need your deepest respect for giving me this request because I am afraid that with God all things are possible. However, I do need your assistance because I don't know when or how I'm going to leave this country. I do need your assistance to provide a bank account where this money would be transferred into. As soon as you receive this letter please contact me so that I can find you a good business to do with this money because later it will be transferred into your account. I am waiting for your response, please reply urgently so that I will let you know the next step to follow. Thanks and God bless. You can contact me on my private email address below or through email: john_marshall@netscape.net Best regards, John Marshall. ___________________________________________________________________________ Follow The Illu 20% off Code:  ___________________________________________________________________________

You are advised to furnish me with your private telephone number or fax number for easy communication The present government have frozen most bank accounts and confiscated most of the bearer bonds of many very rich individuals. According to the NORMANDATED LAW of West Africa, as high ranking government officials and civil servants, we cannot own or have any connected bank account. I have a hidden compartment of $8.5M which my late father kept in a security company in Europe. We have no documents to show that money goes into and we are being robbed blind. In fact, my father's money is being stolen by the government. He deposited the money in the security company as family treasures, to avoid confiscation by the present government. The money was meant for a new light and motor car, but instead, it was being used for a new war. The government are confiscating jewellery and farm implements. My father's safe in the bank overseas has been searched by the government and he was told to produce a new bank account or else be killed. He did not produce a new account and the government seized his safe and farm implements. To make matters worse, the new government abolished the draft and appointed their own draft board which they are using to kill and take everything from the family. According to the NORMANDATED LAW which governs our country, as civil servants who have not yet fully shared in the wealth accumulated over the years, we are NOT allowed to own a foreign account. Therefore, my request to you is that you assist me receive this money into your bank account for us to invest in your country. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate it very much. I will also need you to help me in saving any money which might be gained from this offer.

Please I want you to help me in all my endeavours to help me. I am willing to give up 40% of my share to you for assisting me in this offer. I will give you 40% and 10% will be shared to me between you and me respectively for mutual aid, while the rest will be for my family investment. I am expecting your response urgently so that I can give you a phone and fax number of the bank where the money will be deposited with a security company for safekeeping and protection.

A Somali refugee who wants to invest in a residential real estate business abroad was shocked to receive a phone call from the FBI so that he would not miss the call. When he heard the news about the attack on his country and the Americans that are doing injustice to his country, he immediately contacted his attorney to seek for financial and political assistance in the form of a loan and the brokerage firm also referred his lawyer to the attorney to recruit someone to represent him. The attorney contacted the attorney who advised that my client needs financial assistance in the form of a loan in the amount of US$15/mo, for a fixed period of time. This period of loan helps the client to invest without risk and also to help the government to recover the money that has been invested in the form of tax by the government. The attorney advised that since his client is a refugee, he does not need a foreign assistance of any kind. The government will take the money and use it for the purchase of new military. armored vehicles and light armoured vehicles. The government will also expand the old iron curtain border guard fences and install more. This  attack on my client's family, he told me that he stayed with his family at the international airport in the US so that he could take care of his business investment that he made at the International Airport. My client has promised me 20% of the total sum for my assistance, 5% is for any expenses that I might make and the remaining 75% is for my family. I will be able to do this with my partner because I have full partners that I want to invest in a lot of industries and of which the lawyer will also assist me in investing. As soon as I receive your reply, I will forward your personal information like your full name, date of birth and also your private phone and fax number for easy and urgent contact. I will also need your passport so that I can send you the documents that my attorney will send to you when he receives your phone and fax number. Please reply immediately to my lawyer through the above email account, so that he will give you the phone and fax number to contact him and also your private Email address which my attorney will send to you when you do not accept to work with us. Inform me immediately with the following: 1. Your full name 2. Your date of birth and also your private phone and fax number. 3. Your private fax and phone number. Thank you. I will be waiting for your reply through my letterbox. You should also get your cell phone immediately you receive this letter.  Yours sincerely,  Mrs. Abacha Hussein.

====================
we have been receiving many calls from the public demanding our immediate transfer of the fund into their account but unfortunately we have received no reply from them. We have sent a reminder and hope in heaven that they will answer us but all our efforts proved abortive. I now seek your permission to have you stand as  a next of kin to the late Engr. Peter, so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin. The fund will be paid into your account through a Commercial Bank Account, which we the officials will not understand and will never let us know of. We will destroy all documents of transaction immediately this money is deposited into your account. We have jointly agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as a next of kin, since no one is coming for it and you know nothing about this transaction. The remaining 70% will be for us the officials and we will share the remaining balance. There is no risk involved in this transaction and if you are interested, please get back to me immediately.  Please get back to me immediatley Show some faith and support and don't forget to share the link with your friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I am Dr. Zuma Musa and I am the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. As a matter of fact, I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and legal as all necessary documentation will be supplied to you to enable you claim the fund and make you the next of kin to the deceased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
====================
The movers and shakers at SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE MARKS (SE) are in the process of making arrangements to transfer the sum of US$14.4M, (Fourteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your account, which my partner and I will provide for the deposit of the fund in your country. This money has been sitting there in a dormant account since the late 1990s, when the management of one of the banks that worked with me transferred the bank account of our partner to a new account overseas, this account has no other beneficiary and we can not get the account approved for official disclosure because of the previous holder. The old owner of this account, His Ex-wife and their Young Daughter died before the money was ever approved for release. The Money is in a safeside safe deposit box with an opening balance of US$14.4M that is still under the safe deposit banking. The banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the hands of the government as unclaimed fund. The money has now been approved for transferal into the coffers of the Reserve Bank. I have since then, been the account officer of the account owner for his entire family, because the management of the account owner is on a multy of terms of sharing with me, I have seized his bank account and other bank accounts abroad for disbursement, so that the money will be paid into your account. Thereby to the management have alerted the security company, but I was told that the management is on the move out, because they would soon refer the money to the security company for disbursement. On what has happened to my late father, the management have been assuring me that this was no longer an issue, that everything will be paid to the security company for disbursement. Unfortunately I have lost hope of ever seeing my late father again, because my late father was killed by a group of armed robbers, who invaded our residence, which was a while ago. I have lost confidence with my family, as they have become reckless, and have betrayed all my relations, whom were made to betray me, as well as my country as a whole. In order to continue the good work of the family business, I decided to release this money to you as soon as possible, because the money is now very light (about $4,200 USD US Dollars), and I need you to help me in transferring this money to your account for investment purposes. This money was deposited with a security firm, in hope of a good business venture, but the money has been approved for transferal into your account for official disbursement. The money will be paid into the fund as soon as we confirm receipt of the money. Thereby to reply from you. This is the other part of the business deal, which we decided to do together, so that it will not take more than 10 working days to finish. I now have two options that interest me, but first I must get approval from my family to put the money into any account that you will nominate for this business. So if you can nominate any account, which you will like to assist me to do this business with, I will appreciate it very much. Please to state your phone number clearly so that I will know where to look for the account and the person to assist me with this clientele. Also I will like to do this business with you for an investment, so that the money would be reinvested into the new business of your choice to earn for us the better life. I have decided to give you 10% of the total business money for your assistance. Please I will like you to send me your phone number so that I will know where to send your information for the account details to be put in your account. Yours truly, CRUZ.

====================
With the newest release of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I decided to upgrade my old account with the inconvenience test to see if I can go back to a bank account that I can trust without extra charge. The account is a 1 floor apartment block in central London and I have been here since 6th august 1999. I am the loneholder of the account and I am an office professional, so I decided to reapply to the bank as a new beneficiary of this account. The old saying is that anomalies are born. It is true that at the end of each year , the bank sends out an alert to all the account holders to notify them that an account has been de-felatigned. This also happen yearly, but the total amount is never shown to them. The total amount is $15,000,000.00 USD(Fifteen Million us dollars only), and the  account is turnover every year. Nowadays, if you go to any bank here in London, you will find that they have stopped paying any of their outstanding claims against this account and many other accounts of this sort are being made all over the world. It is because of this that it  is said that nobody will ever come forward to lay claim to the funds. When I was growing up, my friends and I used to go to the bank to get our due share of these funds because we are not allowed to operate any bank account outside our country. The amount involved are $15,000,000.00 us dollars. I did not know this amount at the time of when I made the account but I am aware of it now because  I am extremely well informed. The total amount is deposited in two IC(International Settlements) that hold my name and I as the sole beneficiaries. There is no way that I can ever gather the money before it gets confiscated by the Security company, which I will helpfully  supply as a matter of the agreement. The total amount is US$15,000,000.00 but I want you all to assist me to get the money out to you because this is something that I will do  myself. I will be signing a binding agreement, which you will help me to complete and sign. I will be willing to give you all the documents needed to successfully do this. I need you to assist me in acquiring a good property in your country as well as a good Company that will assist me in investing this money. This is the agreement. As soon as you complete this transaction, I will give you all the information that I will use to ensure that the security company will not trace the money to you. I will also explain to you that as soon as I am convinced that you are a reliable and trustworthy person, this money will be released to you as a joint fund. I want this money to be safe, and I will do all I can to make sure that it is. This is my reason for contacting you, as it will be very beneficial to both of us because I will be able to invest this money in your country. This is my contact information for you to assist me.Kindly get back to me as soon as possible stating your wishes clearly.  Thanks and God bless you. Yours faithfully,  MR.

A peace offering of $15.500 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to the men who killed my father has just been made at Government House here in Cotonou. The money was meant for the purchase of new machine guns and heavy machine guns for the army and I was informed that the world financial institutions are not ready to accept such huge sum of money, so I sent a message to make the offer again but got no reply.After a month my father sent a reminder and finally we discovered that my father had been murdered. On further investigation it was also discovered that my father would have been murdered without any documented                                                                                                                                                             The amount involved is  $ 15.500,000,000.00 (Fifteen million, five hundred thousand United States dollars ). I      received a call from the bank in Cotonou where my father worked as a private in       financial controller, but  on further investigation it was realized that my father's earlier

The transport and savings account provisioning council (T.S.A.C) of the Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa .  On 29th July, 2000, an American oil consultant/contractor with The Oil Trust Fund (OSTF) with The National Institute Of Petroleum Resources (N.P.R) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa, Mr Eddy G. Williams made a numbered time (fixed) deposit  in the account with a value of US$25,800,000.00 (Twenty-five Million United States Dollar) for twelve calendar months, with a maturity date of 30th June, 2000. When the account was last checked, the balance was there at the TSCA of the fund (TWENTY-five Million US Dollar) with an audited balance of the TSCA of the fund (US$25,800,000.00).  The above set of facts is what caused my colleagues and I to compile this data base to see if we can get any member of the TSCA to come over and claim this money.  Because, we are stuck now, as the concurrence is not in favour for us to have this money released, we are not allowed to operate a bank account in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso. So we are now looking for your help to get this money into your bank account as the beneficiary to the funds.  We have agreed to offer you 30% of the total funds, 10% will be set aside to take care of all expenses we might incure in the course of this transaction.  Please get in touch with me by my e-mail address or youdastarr@netscape.net for further information about this transaction.  Awaiting your urgent response.  Thanks and God bless.  Please treat this mail as very confidential.  I AM MAKING THIS PROPOSAL AS A NEXT STEP OF THE PASTURING BANK CORPS of Brothers.   We would like to take care of your payment of the fund by way of credit or debit card transactions.  This is because the management of the company is ready to approve the remittance of payment of this fund to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you upon your positive response.  Please, if you accept my offer do this for us, as we shall discuss in detail the modalities for the immediate release of this fund into your account.  As soon as I receive your positive response, I will give you all the details and necessary information that will facilitate your claim process.  I will also issue you a certificate of origin that will substantiate your claims.  As soon as I receive your positive response, I will also issue you a letter of authority from the bank that this fund belongs to, confirming your money in this account and the account's name as the account owner.  I will also issue you a letter of verification from the account owner, stating your bank's name, address, and telephone/fax.  I will also issue you a letter of a prohibition letter, which will prevent you from receiving the funds into your bank account unless you first apply for a business as a foreign beneficiary with the company name change and signature of the account owner. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you can work with the money to account and I will invest part of this money in your country. I will have to work very hard to ensure that you are able to work with the money to account to the extent of investing your part of the money. However, I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free. Yours sincerely. Marks Joseph

SOUTH AFRICA – THE GOVERNOR,THE VICE-PRESIDENT,THE C.E.O. AND THE C.E.O. OF AFRICAN REPUBLIC OF LIQUID TECHNOLOGIES.  This letter is being sent to you to use for investment purpose,I expect you to be reliable and honest. We wish to start an  energy scheme with the sum of $10.5Millions (Ten million five hundred thousand US Dollars) which we can transfer in your country for investment purposes. This money was generated during the gold and diamond mining boom in Zimbabwe which  was brought about by President Robert Mugabe.  This money is meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for our farms and for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland  because of our old farms beingoprecipe.  The problem is, as soon as President Robert Mugabe came to power, he  confiscated all our farms  and tried us in court for offences He alleged that our farm  was in Africa,and he ordered the seizure of all our farms  and our property.   In order to save my family and my children from being killed, I have in mind to visit  South Africa to seek asylum. So, I have decided to seek a foreign partner to transfer this money out of  South Africa since the law here stipulates that any foreigner who has  assets in South Africa,can not travel out  of South Africa without a visa.  My small Africa bank account has been  seized by the South African government before and since then. I have been  freezing all my son's bank account to no avail.   In order to make sure that I will not be killed or otherwise suffer notional loss,I  now seek a Foreign partner to transfer this money into that fund. In my  first week alone, my son's account in the bank was seized for $20,000,000.00USD. This  money is part of the total sum of the deceased's wealth which our  father had in total investment in Zimbabwe. This money I intend to use for  investment purposes as I have no other place to invest it.   I am willing to give you 20% of the total sum of the deceased's  wealth for your assistance, 5% will go to charity organization,60% for myself and 2% to charity organization in Africa. All other necessary required information will be sent to you after you  confirm receipt of this money on your response for continued investment. Please, I look forward to your urgent reply . With regards , MRS. GABRIELA KABIRO.

via email--
 With Due Respect, I am Mr.Abbas A. Barney, the Executive Director Finance with the National Credit Bank of Nigeria (NCBNC) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who perished with his entire families on 25th July, 2000 on a Sports Fair in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The deceased had a business that ran into several hundred millions of dollars a week plus accrued interest. The owner of this account is a foreigner and a government official,while a member of the sports ministry he also happens to be the minister of Sport and Goodwill. Since the dead body has been lying in the bank for two decades without any claim of the fund, the amount is completely  unexploded and the bank has refused to pay any of the money due to the fact that it is a deposit and cannot be approved for payment. As a result, the family has to resort to the courts to try and get the money paid out because the bank doesn't have the authority to approve such a large sum of money. As a result, the money has been dormant in the account without a beneficiary and the account is patrong the jurisdiction of the bank where the funds is waiting for confirmation from the court for payment. The family has also refused to remit the money out of the bank. The account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that no body has ever existed.  The account is simply a thing of legend and no other person knows about it. Based on this I and my deputy decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money will be paid to the person or company who will forward claims to the bank. The money will be paid to you as soon as the money gets to your account. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I also don't want the bank to know that I am doing this deal with their money since I don't know them and I don't want them to know that this money is my money. I don't want them to know that this money is my money either because I don't know them either or because I don't want them to know that I am doing this deal with their money. This is the basic idea. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm my funds into your account and you also forward your account information for easy and reliable communication.  I want this fund to go into the account of the person/company named  below as next of kin. I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I also don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I want it to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I agree that 40% of this money will go to you as the beneficiary, I will give you 60% of the total money amount, 10% will be for charity both in Africa and in your country, and 70% will be for me and my deputy. I will be expecting your response immediately.  Answer me so that I can give you more details information and my contact.  If you don't accept my proposal, I will give you a better idea and directions to get the other 10% as unclaimed fund. Please get in touch with me immediately through this email address above or you can call or fax me.  Thank you and God bless.  Yours faithfully, Mr.Abbas A. Barney. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail sur i-mode� : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre  téléphone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f

My enquiry as to why this money has not been claimed by any of our customers before I gave you this information to consider is very interesting to me because the bank officials who have no knowledge of the account and probably never have heard of this account before. I am sincerely seeking your assistance in the following ways. 1. To receive this money into your bank account as an overdraft. 2. To serve as the next of kin to the deceased. 3. To make arrangement for the fund to be transferred from the US bank to your account here in West Africa. 4. To receive the fund into your account to be use as an investment for the future of our family. 5. To provide us with a safe bank account to invest this fund. As you can easily confirm from the below information, the customer died with his wife and only daughter on the 31 st of september 2002 in a plane crash. Shortly after the plane crash, they  left the country, and returned very shortly after, to Europe where they were staying on political asylum.  Their bank account had no line of business, and no other person knows about it. I am seeking for your assistance in the following ways. 1. To receive this money into your bank account as an overdraft. 2. To serve as the next of kin to the deceased. 3. To make arrangement for the money to be transferred to your account as the investment for the future of our family. As you can confirm from the above information, the following information has been lost during the course of the investigation: their bank account number, account address, and direct telephone and fax number. I therefore seek your assistance in the following ways. 1. To provide an address for the bank so that the money would be transfer into your account as the deposit for the next of kin. 2. To make arrangement for the bank to transfer the fund to your account as the investment for the future of our family. 3. To serve as the financial controller of the fund. As soon as this information is received by the bank, I will contact my lawyer to start making arrangements for our establishing of a new bank in your country
