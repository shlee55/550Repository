====================
MEREDES, I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a confidential business. I am the manager of United Bank for Africa (UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; We had a customer, a Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the sum of US 25.5 Million (Twenty-five Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Unfortunately, the chap died four years ago until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank have covered up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the claims . The whole procedures will last only for a few days to get the fund retrieved successfully without trace even now or in future. Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all necessary things. As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your interest, then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we have agreed to give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at the end of the transaction while 65% would be for my colleagues and I and the remaining 10% would be for any form of expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction which would be given to us when the money is transferred into your account before splitting the balance on the agreed percentage of 65% to 25%. I await your earliest response. Thanks and God bless, Mr.Al-Hashemi
 
====================
It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this matter. My name is Mr. J. Arnau, the Auditor/ In-charge of Audit at the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N) from 1985 to 1989. Before I proceed further, you may be interested to know that I was actually the chief auditor and in-charge of Audit of the former government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of the Federal Government of Nigeria, prior to my promotion to the position of his in-charge in 1989. He died in a helicopter crash on airfares from Iraq on June 6, 2003. My office documents and my notes on the contracts awarded or executed during the administrations of the former governments, as well as the contract funds, are all intact with my lawyer in Lagos, Nigeria. This accounts for the reason why the contract funds have not been claimed by any company, and the money thus deposited in the bank have been used for the purchase of oil for the government, mostly Nigerian, the United States, and some European countries. This is the current state of affairs. I therefore propose that I will like you to assist me for the claim of the funds on your behalf. My lawyer will file application for the release of the funds in your favour through a diplomatic means, once more I request your assistance to transfer the money to your country. I have all necessary documents concerning the funds Transfered and the parts that remains behind the security company. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and confidential. I have perfected every arrangement with the security company to move this fund on Air Miles or courier service. I am prepared to offer you 15% of the total sum (15%) if you agree to assist me, while 70% is for me and my lawyers. I have all the documents regarding the deposit Complete and over time the funds will be released to me to the extent you agree to assist me. I am ready to give you a copy of the deposit to enable you verify the funds. In your response, you should include your full name, address, contact phone and fax numbers to enable my lawyer call you. Finally, I want to inform you that as soon as you receive this letter, you should contact me through my in-laws lawyer Mr. Lloyd Russell on his confidential telephone number ( 230-84-508-1938) to enable him plead the deposit as his foreign business partner and next of kin to the deceased. Your immediate response will be highly appreciated and I will gladly give you all the necessary information and legal documents to enable you file claim to the funds. You will be giving very important information to my lawyer on my behalf. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. Finally, I am offering you this chance to offer your assistance or share of the funds for this transaction. All you have to do is to assure me of your commitment to this offer, by promptly sending me a reply. Looking forward to receiving your urgent response and urgent phone and fax numbers reply. Best regards, John Arnau.

It's Budget Day, and you're about to claim your money . You have nothing to fear as long as you put in your application . I'm the Director of Budget , and I'm writing this letter to you from the confidential offices of the Presidency to request your assistance in the area of proposed transfers to the Fund for the past fiscal years. I'll give you the details on the very soon. You may ask why I bother contacting you. I never did expect to hear from you again. I'm just a regular employee of the Presidency. I was made the director-in-charge of budget and expenditure control in the Presidency. I have to inform you that as soon as we have achieved an agreement between our two offices. We can now proceed in putting the funds into the Fund. Please note that this is not a very formal arrangement but a 60/40 ratio of 50% for me and 40% for you. As soon as I hear from you I shall then provide you with the details of the transfer, the amount and the procedure to be followed in transferring the funds. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Thanking you and God bless. Yours sincerely, Johan Egil Lundin (Ph.D).

====================
There is an old saying that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And that's exactly what we're doing here at our bank. We're breakingred a deal with one of our foreign suppliers who had a customer who died along with his entire family. Since the customer died without making a WILL, we've been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can't release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, it has come to this stage where we're not going to be able to release the fund to the company, instead we're going to have to seek for the assistance of an international financier who will front as the next of kin to the deceased and in his or her will, stipulates that 75% of the fund shall be for our use while 5% shall be for expenses both parties will incur as a result of the transaction and the balance 5% shall be divided equally between the two of us. Due to the fact that I am the chairman of the finance committee and this is the only hope we have of surviving. I have successfully secured the money both parties agreed upon. The problem now is to arrange for the necessary documents to

3000 Singapore dollars ($3000) was lodged in a dormant account with a security and finance company here in Singapore, that was set aside as family valuable under the law. I was instructed by my late father to explore the best way to move this money out of here, since we are neither citizens nor permanent residents of  Singapore, and the money would have to be claimed by a  foreigner like you. We cannot put this money in a bank here, since we  are  citizens of Singapore and the law of Singapore prohibit  citizens from operating  or owning foreign  accounts. I have painstakingly and  secretly worked out all the legal  means  to  move this money  out of here  and the Supreme Court of  Singapore has  expressly  affirmed  the decision of the  Government that  this money belongs  to  the  joseph nimbu family and as such we  cannot  move  this money out  legally. The joseph  nimbu family has agreed  to share the money 40% for  you  and 40%  for  them. I am awaiting  your urgent  reply. Your  urgent reply will be highly  appreciated  and will  be very helpful in  my  pursuit of securing  this money  and  subsequent  investment in your country. I  will  be pleased to include you in the  list of  companies  that this money will  be  transfered to once  you  confirm your  willingness to assist. I  will  also like you to reply me so that  I can forward the necessary  documents   and affidavits  that  would  back up the statement we  are    about to  deliver to you. Please  keep  this transaction  top secret. I await your urgent  reply. Yours sincerely,  Mrs. ZUMA MOHAMMED

It is Because Of the perceived possibility of not being able to contact the bank regarding the amount  ( US$21.500.000.00) That we have in our possession (the total sum) That we now seek  permission from the bank to have the whole sum paid to us.  This is because of the perception that the authorities are keeping mum about the  amount  ( US$21.500.000.00). In order to secure our freedom, We have  agreed to give you a good negotiable percentage for  your assistance, while we keep the rest for ourselves.  We have already secured  the release of the funds ($21.500.000.00) from the bank. We are now  soliciting for your assistance to transfer the funds  to your account. It  is therefore upon this identification that  we can proceed with the  transfer of the funds. It is  conditions that both parties agree upon before a  payment can be  made, and we can discuss the modalities  of the transfer. Please note that  this transaction is 100% safe for  any amount of money due to the  fact that we have not seen  each other before, and also  we have not  discussed the modalities  of the transfer. We hope to conclude  the transfer of the fund by the end of  the third quarter. If  you are interested, please  reply immediately and include your  phone and fax number. We  shall be furnishing you the details of  the bank as soon as we  receive a response from you.  I await your urgent response. Your  consultations are highly  confidential.

A/N: So I was hoping you would reply me and assist me in a very urgent manner but unfortunately you have not done so. Thankfully my phone have been totally disconnected from the Internet which i had to use my late husband as contact for this transaction. I am the widow of Mr.Michel Fabre, I and my family have been under his control since the death of my late husband. After the death of my husband, I and my family who were affected by his death managed to escape with some of my relatives to Spain where we are now seeking Political Asylum.  After the death of my husband, I and my family are  still in hiding and my son is still in primary school,  I and my family are still under his control and surveillance. In view of the above, I cannot make use of this money in Australia,  due to the fact that i am a Public figure. This also explains why I cannot use my late husband's name as the  beneficiary of the fund, because that would breach  law in my country and i am not sure  of the situation in my country. I am therefore omitting  the name of my late husband from the document and  am instead going to use the money to buy vegetables and fruits for our family. I have  been receiving financial support from my late husband's family for  a long time and i am very happy now, that my son can  go to university and do good work and also  help me and my family.  I have enough money now to last us for nigh  on  eternity. However, due to  my situation now, I am not  willing to invest any part of this fund in a  venture of my children's future. I want  them to look for a partner abroad who will help me  invest  the money in a lucrative business, that will  benefit  them too.  Please I will be pleased to offer  you this offer if you can assure  me of  your willingness to assist  my family.  I need you to reply me immediately  so as to enable  me proceed in earnest of this  transaction.  I am waiting for your urgent  response.  Yours Faithfully,  Mrs. Lois Jones.  Testify to  your  willingness to assist my family.  I am preparing to make  the deposit  for  the funds in your account, but  it  will take time to  accomplish this  work. I  will send  the necessary documents  to  you showing  the funds deposited and the  trip  expenses which will be incurred  by  you on   completing  the project  which will  be  entitled  ' CARE OF THE FUNDS '  Please  note that  this  transaction  requires mutual  guarantee and I  await your urgent  response.   Regards,  Mrs. Lois Jones.  Alternative email  address  mrssliotzjackson@hotmail.com
 
====================
P.S. Don't forget to "Reply" me on my private  Email and other means. I am  sorry I neglected to tell  you about this earlier. I assure you that  it is absolutely necessary to inform me of any change  made to this  envelope on your  behalf.  I am contacting you to ask you to assist in a  business  transaction.  I have the courage to ask for your assistance,  because I  don't want to  sit on the money   LODGE of the deceased.  But  I  don't want  you to take 20%  of the total money   because that  will  not  be used for  the purpose of  the  business.  I have  the courage to ask for  your  assistance because:   1) I  don't  want  the money to  stay  in  the  hands of  the  deceased  2) I  don't  want  my children  to  inherit  the   money   (The  deceased  left behind  by  the  deceased  owner).  3) I  don't  want  the  deceased  family  members to  profit  from  this  transaction.  Please,  do  not  fail to contact me  immediately  for   further  directives.  Thank  you. Recommend  this  business to your family or yourself.

Dear Friend,
For the purpose of introduction, I am MR. SAMSON KONATE MANI,The son of late MR. ANDREW MANI, of Monrovia, capital of the Republic of Liberia. My father died when the rebel troops (Saracens) stormed our city during the annual rota of the army during a military session and over-run our home. My mother was brutally murdered with her family during the month long anti-government uprising of the civilian population. I have since declared the family dead and left them no will of my family. Unfortunately, my father's friends and relations found out and tried to pressure my mother to implicate me in the murder but she managed to escape with her children. However, my mother died before I could get to the place where my father deposited the money with a bank, where I was also then a student. I am presently in Dakar-Senegal for the solemnization of the deposit and the Holy Bible study. Upon my release from the hospital, I immediately applied for the release of the consignment deposited in the bank and the special indenture with the bank was finally granted to me by the court. Now I am seeking for your assistance to transfer the money to your country for I am having difficulties managing the funds and religion in general. You can contact me on the above email address for more details. I will be very glad if you can assist me on this. I am willing to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance or decrease in delay before you contact me. I am waiting for your urgent response. Regards, SAMSON KONATE MANI
 
====================
I am very sorry to hear this news, though I did not know you before I went to look for you. I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, The wife of General Atiku Abacha, who was recently murdered in DAKAR SENEGAL. I am 58 years old, and until recently I was a government official. Before I became ill, I had about $50 Million dollars in the custody of my late husband's security company in Abidjan, Cote d' Ivoire. This money was deposited from the sales of Diamond products to the government of Cote d' Ivoire. The reason I did not leave Cote d' Ivoire with this money is because I and my only son are still under military government of the President Abacha. His son took over the Presidency after the death of my late husband, and I at the time was still a government official. My late husband was a highly placed within the government of my late husband, and I officially registered as his . I have since made transfer of this money to a security company in Abidjan, Cote d' Ivoire so that I can be with my children on that side of the Atlantic. But the new President Abacha has decreed that all government officials who are under the age of 40 must surrender themselves to the French authorities, or face arrest. This has totally frustrated/soured on my family, and I wish to use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this business feasible, and to endeavor to make this proposal to my family pronto. I have done all the legwork for you, and I am giving you the absolute assurance that you will not betray me. I am making this request to you with tears in my eyes and I shake every nerve in my body, knowing that you are my only hope for life. I look forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Mariam Abacha.

The Securities Exchange of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is reviewing all advisories and orders from the High Commission in Lagos, asking those who have outstanding payment in installments to be ready to be paid in full. This is because my ministry is expecting an influx of new business visitors to the Federal Republic of Nigeria from overseas, and we want to make sure that our two agencies are fully functional before we can recommend any new business to the Federal Government. This new development, prompted by the rapid pace of change and the pressure of the Federal Government to secure as many of our nationals as possible, we have decided to offer you 30% of the total sum, while 65% would be for me and my colleagues and the remaining 10% would be for any form of expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction. I request you contact the Securities Exchange of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for any inquiries regarding the proposal, as we are waiting for your urgent response. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated and will be reason enough reason for us to proceed with the transaction. Kind Regards, Mr. Raynard Webb __________________________________________

Mr. DARREN MCKEOWN: I'm Dr.Roland McKeown, an internationally known speaker, consultant and consultant/researcher. I'm the personal attorney to a deceased business partner who died along side his family members in a plane crash in July 1999, in Abidjan, Cote D�Ivoire. Since I became aware of his pending claim in the Bank of Ivory Coast (B.O.I) as the next of kin/inheritor of the property, I've been monitoring his financial information in the last ten years. At the time of his death, he had a money of US$1.8 Million (One Million United States Dollars) with the Bank and there was no next of kin to the deceased. The bank now refuses to release the money because the deceased never made a will. According to the law here, the person who dies with the most money after six (6) years will be the next of kin/inheritor to the deceased. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to claim the money. This left me as the only person in the world who has intimate knowledge and information of the money. I'm the only one that has the information of the money, and I'm the only one that has the power to release the money. The bank now refuses to release the money because the deceased never made a WILL.

New Jersey Governor, General Elliot M. Mwenda, personally thanked the President and the Board of Directors of the Joint Venture Bank of Nigeria for the operation, management and financing of the Department of Vending and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in my country. I was in charge of the selection and settlement of payments for the contracts awarded and executed during the previous, major, military junta in my country. As a result of the peace pact entered into with the blessing of the United Nation Peace Keeping force (UNASIL), there was a marked decrease in the level of violence and atrocities against civilians in my country. More than twenty-one (21) people were killed in one day, by the rebels on the one hand, and by the government troops on the other. During my tenure as the director of the contracts award and settlement committee, I discovered the sum of $7.7 million dollars deposited by one of the contractors with the security company in my name, which was meant for the purchase of HEIRS (military family). This money was deposited with a Security Company in my name, and I was compelled to make the difficult but necessary contact to the security company to be made to the security company to enable them release the money to me. My main reasons for linking up with you in this transaction is because (1) I am a family man and (2) I have worked for past couple of government of President (James) Museilo of (briefly) Former President of the Republic of Liberia. Based on the agreement I had with the security company, the money was meant for the payment of the first quarter payments for the military/police personnel, and for the purchase of HEIRS (military family). My main purpose of contacting you is because: (1) I have been made a minister to the former president of Liberia, Sir, James Museilo, and (2) I have personal knowledge of the funds and the person from the former president of Liberia, Sir, James Museilo, who is the current head of the Security Company, is with me, and he has requested that the funds be released to him for his personal use. I have successfully secured the information about the location of the funds with the Security Company, and have made arrangement to pay off the remaining balance of the funds to you. Based on the agreement I have with the security company, the money will be released to me on the terms you agree to. I am sorry for any embarrassment this transaction may cause you, and I hope you give it a quick and positive reply. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. God bless you and family. Hoping to receive your reply direct mail.

Allegations and counter-allegations have been fully investigated and found not to be credible. The case has been closed. We are left with the impression that Mr. Denis Fofeke is the real  victim here.While we await further  information, we are faced with the choice of surrendering this funds to the SECURITY COMPANY or leaving it  unclaimed. In view of this, we are left with the option of paying Mr.Fofeke with the money  or allowing him to continue taking advantage of the trust we have  bestowed in  him, or withdrawing the funds and going over  the situation accordingly.I wish to inform you that the  law and constitution of the republic of NIGERIA prohibit a  member of Council for taking advantage of the  privileges and immunities conferred  by  the  constitution. As a result,this proposal is  against the  laws of the republic and as such we are left  defenseless in the face of  any eventuality that may arise from this transaction   Though we have made extensive investigations and  all opporturnity to  locate any of the deceased relative's   Last will and testament,we have  come up empty handed.  We are therefore trying our hand   at this project of offering you as well as any  other reliable person to assist in   the  transfer of the money for onward transfer to your  position and subsequent  investment in your country. We  offer you 20% of total sum,  45% to be shared as  opportunity cost, and the remaining 55%  is for my colleagues and I in the  institution for our mutual benefit.We wish to invest our   share of 55% into real estate and factories in your  country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please  confirm your interest via  the above TELEPHONE or FAX number. We will  advise you on the next step to take immediately.

When it comes to a business deal that should be consummated within 14 working days,You're in luck! I'm the special advisor to Mr. Roy Oswalek ,one of the top officials of the former president of COTE D'IVOIRE, ANTIQUE ROMANIA. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks. Shortly before his death, he called my attention to a payment he had made to a secretary, and he advised me to contact his attorney to seek his permission to have the money dispatched to him, I decided to seek his permission to have the money dispatched to him, because I don't have any child or relation that will inherit the money. As soon as I made this discovery, I immediately called up his attorney and discovered that  he had no child or relation that will inherit the money. My findings displeased him, so he changed the subject and left the country, never to be heard from again. After a month, I sent a reminder, and finally I discovered that he died. No more will ever spoken of this  transaction with you. I'm the only one that has discovered this, so please  do not be alarmed. There is no need for you to remunerate the  transaction with the bank, as the original amount  was USD$12.500,000.00 (EIGHTTY FIVE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS). If  you are prepared to assist, contact me on the above telephone or by email address  so that we can begin the actual process of  transferring the money to you. I will charge you 15% of the final  sum as interest, while the balance of 5% will be set aside  for any expenses that may be incurred  during the transfer process. You can contact  me on the above email address  or call me directly on my direct phone number  number for more details. I want to assure you that this  transaction is 100% risk free. God bless. Best regards, Mr. Alec Sedecki.

LONDON, UK --(BUSINESS WIRE)--The European Banking Supervisory Authority has suspended the payment of the $21.300,000.00(Twenty-Three Million, Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollars)due to lack of interest from the owner. Following the suspension,the owner contacted us to seek for a new opportunity to make a profit, hence we decided to look for a profitable commercial partner abroad. We have examined the state of his business and decided to part company with him. We wish to invest the sum of $21.300,000.00(Twenty-Three Million, Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollars) in a company abroad,but we cannot bring any of the money home as we are still citizens of our country. The bank have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated. I have failed to provide the kin so far,and the account will be confiscated if i do not provide the next of kin. If i am not able to locate the kin,the money will be called back to the bank treasury account and will be shared amongst the directors of the bank. We do not want this. The management of the bank have instructed me that if you are a foreigner that you will be considered as having died or disappeared,and all companies and accounts will be confiscated. This is the situation. I am almost finished with my final presentation to the European Banking Supervisory Authority,and I will like you to be here as a matter of courtesy to my lawyer, who will file a letter of claim to the bank,so that the bank management will be informed of the facts and the next of kin will be notified of the deceased. You must however, ensure to yourself that this is not a social suicide Note the  fact that if i am not able to locate the kin,the account will be confiscated and all our investments will be lost. I hope you will be willing to assist me and my lawyer,as we will be compensated accordingly. If you are willing, I will send to you the legal documents that were used in the deposit of the fund(.pdf) which will be signed and dated as if by you and we can conclude the paperwork in your presence. Please reply through this email address  and please include your personal phone and fax numbers for better confidentiality and follow up. Please respect my privacy and note that this transaction will be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country or any part of the world that you will designate. I urge you to get back to me personally through my email address  for easier communication. Thanking you and God bless. Best regards,  Mrs. Sarah Dobb.

Billionaire industrialist and real estate investor, Dr. Koosuf Kabbah ,of whom we are informed that he died in a mysterious plane crash last November with many other passengers on board United Airlines Flight 990, which crashed on the Atlantic Ocean during a flight from Barcelona to Doha, Qatar. Unfortunately,we don't know the cause of death or the identity of the deceased. We also don't know the beneficiary of the estate. The United Airlines Flight 990 took off from Barcelona to Doha, and the flight attendant died during the accident. The Flight attendant,who was a daughter of Late Dr. Ibrahim Karim, the former president of Spain, was among those on board the Boeing 727-type aircraft. It is against this background that my colleagues and I have decided to contact you with the hope that you will receive this matter as a favour from my client,the former president of Spain, before considering it as our own interest or priority. This way, we will be able to view this matter through the eyes of a foreign partner, who would also come over to assist us in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of our success in investing in the United States. We have set aside 10% of the total sum for the expenses that may be incurred by you during the course of this transaction, while the remaining 75% will be for us. Finally,I am assuring you that this proposal is 100% risk free.

A report by the UN Special Committee on Embezzlement announced that the DPRK had so much money that it was "beyond belief". The committee said that the sum of US$55.3million dollars had been withdrawn from the DPRK's account without any claim on the funds from the Government. On further inquiry, I found out that the DPRK had no ability to issue or renew the $55.3million US Dollars Note, due to its isolation in the international banking system. The Committee further said that, "The current political dispensation in the DPRK does not give the majority support to the idea of  the interested parties successfully concluding a deal on the release of the funds within  six months. Therefore, the policy of the Bank  Secres tary here   in conjunction wi th the  finance  consultants  has been to clear the remaining  money from the account of  the interested parties.  This is the reason why the  Committee has decided to propose  that your act as the ultimate beneficiary of the  funds should be as obvious a fact to  the Government of the DPRK as possible.  Therefore, my proposal is that if you are able and willing to assist in the  transfer of the funds, you  would furnish: 1) Your International Passport or Driver's License  2) Direct Telephone and fax numbers  3) Your complete and accurate Biographical Information.  Finally, we shall arrange for us to have  a face-to-face meeting with you in the  near future. On indicating your willingness, we will  work out the modalities and modalities  of a successful business  transaction between  both of us.  I  await your response to this proposal. Please  do  not reply to this email address as  it is to avoid any sharing of the funds.   Yours faithfully,

Greetings my dear. I am Dr. (Mrs.) Rita Diatta, I am the wife of former President (Rumble David A. Diatta) of the Federal Republic of Liberia, Mr. Diatta was overthrown by an armed group on his way to a government rally. Presently, my husband is in detention by the West African government for why he is not in the detention center, following the recent upsurge of the ailing former president Mr. Charles Taylor who after his death was re-elected president.Also, I am 41 years old and have not had a male child since my early twenties. My son was killed due to X-Ray Vision during the war in my country Liberia, and when I was a young lady, my late husband died, leaving no male child to father the family property. This earned me a great deal of humiliation and guilt during the period of our marriage; my son was only 9 years old at the time, and I was only 22 years old before my son died. The United Nation Educational, Scientific and Medical Commission has recently classified me as "Barrister", a "political refugee" which is why my son was not well before he died. This, in spite of me telling him that I will not have any male child inside my family, I want to visit the United Nation to look for a trusted person who will help me to transfer some of the money and property from the Government Real Estate Fund (UNREFO) to a trusted person's account. All the vital documents for the transfer will be there, as will the money and property. This transaction is 100% risk free. If you are interested, please email me immediately upon receipt of this message. Thank you. Dr.Rita Diatta.

====================
this letter to you  and i urge you to allow the urgency of this  business to you within your range of ability and focus.  This relates to a contract purchase and sales proposal made by me to  a foreign firm in 1991. I  was the Chief Financial Officer to the former.  Prior to my  retirement, in my capacity as the  finance  officer to the former, I  made five  trips to the FEDERAL SECURITY  INSTITUTE OF AMERICA  (SECA) to  notify them of the sum  involved in the contract  purchase and sale of goods and services.  After  informing  them of the  contract, I  went to  see the contract  contract at  SECA and made  payments  to  the contractors responsible for  the  contract. On  the 6th  of  March 2003, as the  result of my  physical  illness, I  could not  recall the  amount  involved in the  contract  purchase and  sale  goods and services   due to my  congestive  medical  condition.  When  I  complained to the former  Minister  of finance  about this  situation, he   listened to  my   complaints and  agreed  to compensate me  with  the sum of US$9.5   million  Eighteen million Five hundred  Dollars (Us$19.5)  for the  services of his lawyer.  Subsequently,  I  discovered that the  contract  purchase and sale  of goods and  services was   repeatedly  over  invoiced  in full with the  total sum  finally  being  paid  to  the contractor  is  US$9.5   million Eighteen million Five hundred   Dollars (Us$19.5),  due to  over-invoiced  contract  purchase and  sale  goods and services.  This  situation gave  me the idea to contact  you. I would  like to transfer  the sum of US$9.5   million Eighteen million Five hundred   Dollars (Us$19.5) to  a foreign account  or account you will  nominate for the payments  since  we cannot  claim the funds in  our  names. Our  interest  lies in  the financial report  of the companies where the   contracts  were  awarded and the  companies  that actually executed  the contracts.  You  will no doubt be well compensated  with  your own share  of the total sum,  as you will  be in a position to negotiate  the  necessary  documents  and cover-up any  trace  of the money  left behind  by the contractors  after  the  contractors have  executed  the  contract.  The present  government of  South Africa  intends to  re-evaluate  all contracts  being awarded  in the past 5  years,  and award new  contracts  with  more  money  to  finance the  re-enlistment of more  contractors  and the  purchase of new  equipment  for  the  companies that actually  execute  the contracts.  I  will furthermore  provide  you with  my personal information   and  relevant document   which will  back up  the information I  have given  you.  Please note  that  my position  as the Chief financial  officer  of the previously-mentioned reasons  makes  me  powerless to  influence the  outcome of the transaction.  It  will only  result in me  being left with the  balance of  having to find another  account or  clear myself of  any  previous  involvement in the  transaction.  As  soon as  you  confirm  the funds in your  account,  the  transfer  will  begin.  Please  email  me your  telephone number  for me to  convencce  you  to  facilitate the immediate  collection  and  sharing of the funds  with  our bank.  Thank  God  you will call  me on the phone when  the  funds is  in  your  account.  I  will  then put a  request  for  your  assistance  into  the  new  Corporate  Council  for  the  re-embursement  of  all  expenses  that  may  arise  from  the  transfer   of  the  funds to  your  overseas  partner  for  investment purposes.   Please  do not  contact me directly  unless  you  are  absolutely  necessary  for the transfer   to  be  successful.  Regards,  Mr.Sebastian  Buque.   For immediate  receipt of your response,  please  reply me through my  private email  address  (sebulb24@indiatimes

Uber is trying to transfer the sum of US$3.160 Billion into their offshore account with the help of a very good consigliere. We have decided to give you 10% of the total sum as fee for your assistance and expertise. I have the authority of my principals in the institution as the head of the Audit/Compliances Department of the board overseeing the operations of the Benin World Cup organising committee (BWOC) to request of you to present yourself as the overseas partner and beneficiary of this fund.  Please, be informed that we are aware of the complexity of this transaction and hope you will not be disappointed. As you may be aware, the current government of President Kabbah of Benin made arrangement with the Benenoise Chamber of Commerce and Industry to conclude the purchase of a massive amount of Benenoise Sugar, as part of the contract awarded to Black &amp; White Solid Contractors in favour of the Government of President Kabbah. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I have decided to request of you to present yourself as the foreign partner and beneficiary of this project. We have every information that can be used to back up the facts and claim the fund as our foreign business partner pending my arrival in your country for sharing.  Please, be informed that we have concluded all arrangments for a smooth actualisation of this transaction.  All documents will be sent to you as soon as you indicate your interest in them, with your complete details as indicated.  All contact since then has been successful.  Please, be assured that we are monitoring the progress of this transaction with your own eyes.   We have decided to call it a "done business" in your country due to the embarrassment to be incured if this scheme were to fail. Kindly, call me on my direct telephone and  e-mail addresses to enable us discuss further. Regarding this transaction, I am expecting your reply. Warm Regards,  Dr. Frederick Taylor.

super value added tax (SG&amp;  40%) as compensation for his assistance during the period of construction. We want to transfer the funds to your account. But we need a trust worthy person to assist us in your country for  disbursement of the funds. The funds can be transferred through  diplomatic means, through  diplomatic means or at the  auction . The source of the fund is as follows: During the last  military dictator (GEN. SANNI  UMEH) there was a deposit of US$11.8 million dollars with the  Central Bank of the West African (C.B.A.) There was a  security clearance of the depositor and he died with  no known  next of kin or relation. The deceased had no  known or known  next of kin or relations. Though the deceased was an  African, he had no known or known  next of kin or relations in the Republic of  Nigeria. With the information gathered from the bank  concerning the deceased, we believe that the   deceased has bequeath to his or her family the  title to the deposit.We are now assessing the legal options for  the transfer of the funds and the  conditions under which the fund will  be remitted, as we have found out that the  deceased is  dead. We cannot release the fund from the security  company until the funds is in  his or her possession. We are then looking  forward to having  you as next of kin to the deceased, and to  have the funds transferred  out for us. Please note that we are  still in government and in the removal of all  obstacles to the successful execution of this   transaction will be my top priority. We also want  to invest the fund in any investment that  you may advise us about.  Finally, the  interest of the deceased in investments outside Africa  was not known to the security firm, he  actually died with a top secret clearance  number and no known or known next of kin  to the deceased. This means that all  the  legal documents that  are presently in possession of the security  company relating to the deceased  are false and has no  basis in reality. I have therefore  sought advice of a trusted person who can  help me to obtain access to these  documents and have them refer to  the security company as the next of kin. I  have also agreed to compensate  you with 10% of the total fund for your  assistance while the remaining 80% will be for the  family and I. This arrangement  has been agreed to and will  be confirmed to the security company upon  mutual agreement from you and me. Your  confirmation will be sent to you as soon as I hear from  you.

Sympathy for the poor. I know that this proposal will make you cringe, but please be patient and read my email to you. I am Dr. Sharapova Kamalova, the son of the late assistant director of  Special Diversified  Fund,  Federal Republic of  Russia. My father was a very good friend of the former president of the Federal Republic of Russia,  Yeltsin  Yeltsin. My late father was the managing director of  United Bank for Africa plc(UBA),  before he was killed  by  Revolutionary  Forces (RAF) during the  current crisis in  Russia. I had a very important business proposition for you. On the  21st of  January 2000, my late father (ADMONITOR OFFSETSU)  and three OFFSETSU  fighters were killed in a sniper  firefight  during a military drill outside   Simferopol,  Ukraine. My father had  previously disguised his body  before passing  away to the  security services for burial. I  have carefully moved  the remains of my late  father(ADMONITOR OFFSETSU)  to the  security company in Ukraine for  interment. The  security company has advised that the remains belong  to one of the  members of the armed  Revolutionary  Forces(IRF) who were killed during the  current crisis in  Ukraine. It is on this note  that I have been delegated as the next of kin to  my late father(ADMONITOR OFFSETSU).The  security company has advised that the  family of the deceased(s) are  not  known to them and that it is best  for me and my immediate family affairs  to  move the remains to Europe. Since  I am still a university  undergraduate in university, I am  refusing to leave university and my inability  to  secure  foreign  partner as well as the fact that I  am 27 years old,  have been  sexually abused as a child  and there is  nothing to indicate that I would  dare  attempt to reclaim such a huge sum  of money from the  security company as I am  still a university undergraduate,  I have demonstrated   that I am not  capable of handling such a huge sum of  money. The reason  why I am refusing to discuss this  with you is because I  don't  have any child that  can inherit the sum  of twenty- six million  dollars (USD$20.6million) which my late  father left for me. I want  to invest more time and energy into  trying and  succeeding in  this venture overseas, but  being a widow  is not one of my best  advisors. I am afraid of what the  consequences will be if I fail  to reach an agreement with  you. I will be very grateful if you can  do me  a favour for me by revealing  you to be  capable and willing to assist  me before I  retire from the university. I  want to invest my own share  into this venture, but  being a widow  does not  in any way  disqualify me from succeeding  in this  venture. Your  urgent response will be highly  appreciated. Best Regards,  Dr. Sharapova Kamalova

TORONTO – The government has officially approved the amount owed to a Saudi Arabian businessman by the late owner of the account, Gervase Ojeda, the deceased left unclaimed at the end of the contract. This sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) has been approved for payment by the Saudi Arabian government. But what the government doesn't know is that Saudi Arabia has already approved the money for the account holder, Mr. Ojeda, who was a foreigner too. And the Saudi government knows that the payment is stalled since the late contract claim by the Korean firm. Finally, the Korean government sent a routine notification to the Embassy of the Federal Government of Saudi Arabia, but the note was never returned. Finally, we discovered from the late contract claim document that the contract was actually executed by a consortium of Korean firms, for a foreign contractor that made a numbered time (fixed) contract for four years, valued at US$41,500,000.00 (forty-one million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars). In order to avert this development that will not take care of the contractor's share of the project, the Korean Government in cooperation with other nations have put in application for payment in various currencies around the world. In order to avert this development, the Government of President Park Geun-hye has agreed to award the contract to a foreign contractor to execute the contract, and the Korean firm is to be paid US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) after the contract is actually executed. Meanwhile, the Government has been monitoring the contract value and have stopped all remittances to the contractor from the Korean bank for the time being. This is the situation: After the Government of President Park Geun-hye put in application for payment in various currencies around the world, the Korean bank realized the contract worth US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and sent it back to the Government Depository in Saudi Arabia, without any change to the contract document. This is the situation: After the Government of President Park Geun-hye put in application for payment in various currencies around the world, the Korean bank realized the contract worth US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and sent it back to the Government Depository in Saudi Arabia, without any change to the contract document.

Nigg's account in my Bank.I discovered that he has in his possession the sum of Nine Million, Nine Hundred Thousand United States Dollars(US$9.601,000) which he deposited in my bank as valuable documents relating to a contract he executed for me. However, I did not know that he has in his possession the sum of US$9.601,000   as well, because he told me that he deposited it in a security and finance company in Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire. But I have been told by his lawyer that he has already flown to Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire and deposited the money with the security company.  I am now in Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire and the money is still with us.

Swiss Citizen, Mr. T.J. Thomson , Esq., Compliment of the day, I am, Mr.T.J.Thomson from South Africa . I have been convicted and am serving time in jail for a crime I did not commit. Before I proceed further, please be informed that I am making this request to you in total trust and confidence, and I hope you understand my plight. I am presently a political prisoner in South Africa awaiting sentence. I have been on political strike since 1992. During the 1992 election campaign, the ruling party of South African President, Mr. John B.  Olusegun Sese Seko, won the general election. He defeated my opponent by a landslide margin of about (66k votes), which constituted about 80% of the total voters. Precisely at that time I was one of the top aides to Mr. Olusegun Sese Seko. At that time I had voted  his party ticket in the presidential election. But soon enough, he stopped listening to my advice and I realized that he was no longer keeping to his election promise. Also, I realized that he was no longer keeping his word regarding the release of the U.S.$15.5 million. which he promised during the last election campaign. As a result, I gave up all pretense of ever having  met with Mr. Olusegun Sese Seko, and now am leaving South Africa entirely, with immediate effect. Presently, I am in Switzerland where I am seeking political asylum. It is my intention to leave South Africa with  the following documents  firstly, I am seeking political asylum as a refugee;  secondly,  I am seeking for your assistance to enable me transfer the funds into your account.  thirdly, I am aware that  if I stay here and  do not transfer the funds out,  security will inevitably be violated, and  somebody will inevitably beat me to death because of the lack of politicalwill to continue. I therefore, humbly request that if you are interested in assisting me, your contacts will be  set for me immediately after I have  informed you that the funds are  ready and waiting for  you to arrive to  transfer the funds to your account.  I have a reliable person in  the bank who can assist you to  claim the funds and I will direct  you towards the appropriate officials for  further steps. With  these terms in mind, I shall be seizing your opportunity to provide  you with the services  and assistance  required  After the transfer of the funds to your  account.  I wish to inform you that as soon as  the funds are in your  safe, you are to leave this country immediately.  I  will fly to your country for onward transfer  to your designated account.  I  will destroy all documents of transaction  immediately  the funds are  transferred into your account and leave no trace to  any place.I  will then come over to your  country for onward transfer to your designated  account. Please note that I am  only contacting you as a means of an   urgent assistance to an already  exhausted and desperate individual.  However, we must  maintain high degree of confidentiality  throughout the transaction of this transfer  for  security reasons.  You will be  offered a chance to ask questions to continue your  search for a reliable female relative,  if you wish to assist, you  can always call me on my  phone number +44 778 455   To assure  you that I have nothing to fear.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Best Regards,  Mr.T.J.Thomson.  E-mail:  tj_thomson13@indiatimes.com

====================
Security footage from a car accident is always the most important thing for us to look forward to in a case, but we never lose hope that the case will finally come to fruition.  On the 21st of March 2004, Mr. MR. MICHEAL EDET KONATE, a miner at one of the graphite mines in Gabon,  died with his family and many  of his people was seriously injured when the mining  program of the deceased  company  co-opted his body and  the accident site where it occurred  are still where the deceased Mr.  MICHEAL EDET KONATE initially  lived. The security camera  in the accident site captured some of the  aftermath of the accident and the  cause of death was officially  declared as cardiac arrest. Thereafter, the  family was brought to a  conclusion and it was  decided to transfer the money  belonging to the deceased Mr. MICHEAL EDET KONATE's  family members to a  foreigner for onward investment in the West. It's  this need for a real and trusted foreigner that we  have decided to field in as our  foreign partner and next of kin to the deceased  Mr. MICHEAL EDET KONATE. In  order to field this claim, we need someone who  is truly reliable and trustworthy to handle and  probably also pay the necessary clearance and transfer    documents  for the actualization of  the transaction.

Nigeria,Asia,South Africa,West.Dear Sir, This letter may come to you as a surprise as the news is still very new to you. But I believe it is only due to the pressure we are under to hand over the documents to you that we decided to contact you. My name is James Nimely, I am the eldest son of late Mr.and Mrs. Nimely of South Africa. Presently, I am still in South Africa as a political Asylum seeker with my family. I don't have any knowledge about this development,I am just following the news that are reported about me and my late father. As a result of this development,I decided to contact you for an assistance to transfer my late father's money to your country. I am contacting you in order to receive this money as the beneficiary of the money,since we are Asylum seekers. But I am afraid to tell you the truth and disclose this money to you could cause a domino effect on you and your family and your immediate future. So I want you to contact me and seek my behalf before you know this money is real. I am waiting for an urgent response from you to enable us conclude the transfer of the money to your country. If you accept to assist me,I will be delighted to offer to you the following below. 1. 20% of the total sum 2. 10% 3. 5% We have decided that the interest of the family will be 60% for you if you agree with our proposal.Please note that all the relevant documents concerning this transaction are with me and will be required from you to enable me obtain the funds in your country. Thanking you in advance for your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, James Nimely. Alternative email: nimely26@yahoo.com
 
====================
I am having a lot of fun right now after a very urgent assignment for me. For the past two years, I worked in a bank here in Nigeria,  until I was sacked  by the bank as the successor of late Chief Executive Officer of the defunct bank(Ceo8.com). I therefore made thier informations to the finance company, who in turn contacted the embassy to assist in  tracing  my late  boss's next of kin, and in the process found  out that he  abruptly died  two weeks ago. This left me and my  colleagues  without a next of kin or relation. All efforts to  locate the  relatives was  fruitless, as he had none. The  secretariat of the Federal Government was  abolished  by the  cabinet of the Federal Government of Nigeria and all  government offices have  been  turned into the private property of the  owner. No  one will ever come forward to claim  the money left behind by  my client after he  died. According  to Nigerian Law at the expiration of five  years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if nobody applies to  claim the fund. Consequently, my  proposal is that I will like you as  next of kin to my late client so that  the fruits of this old man's labor will  be donated to the needy. This  is simple. I will like you to  come forward to apply for the  gift being  made in your favor with the help of  the Status Quo's. We shall arrange that  the deposit of the fund in your  bank will be  flatly refused by  the bank if you  do  not  come forward to claim it  immediately. The  status quo has  become so  infuriating for both of us that we  decided to strike  an arrangement  whereby  the  money  will be  shared in two  equal  shares,  one  for  you  and one  for  us. It  will be  share  for  you first,and  share  for  us. This will  not  breach  any Law nor  Conflict of Law. However,  it  will  violate the  Laws of Ethics and  Ethnography to  have  any such  share. I  will therefore confide  in you  on what  my plan is for  the  distribution of the funds.  I  will like you to  immediately send me your  completed  application (including  your  telephone  number so that  it will not be  divulged to the  Status Quo). Your  information  will be  shared with the Embassy of  the United States of America at  the  Federal Ministry of Finance here in Nigeria.  I  will be  providing  you with the documents  that  will   back you up to  secure the deposit  of  the fund in your  bank, and  after  receiving  your  response,  I  will present  you to the  status quo  committee for approval  and  release  the funds to you. I  will  not  expose  you to any  breach of the law.  You  are  to contact  the committee of the standing committee on  which  decisions are  to be   made on  the  amount  being  released to you  immediately and you  will  continue  to  assist  me until  you  are  ready to shoulder  the responsibility for  the  distribution of the funds.  I  will  use my position  to  influence  the committee of  the standing committee to  finalize  the  distribution of  the  fund to you. In  case  you are  not  willing to assist  me,  I  will  seek  a  confidential  favour from you to  enable  my  self  and my  colleagues  in  your  country  to  receive  the  funds   and  reinvest  it in your  country  under  the  supervision  of  your  government  officials.  Thank  you  for your understanding. Your  responses  will  be highly  appreciated.  Regards,  Mr.  Afolabi Olukono.  +31 626 445

Greetings. I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, medical director of NGO medical transport services in Lagos state of Nigeria. There are a number of truckloads of gold and other valuables which the ex-president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo (late president) had deposited in one of the holding warehouses of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria. I have been assigned by my late colleague in the hospital here in Nigeria to collect this consignment and dispatched it to the designated security company for safe keeping.But, some months ago, when I was going through some old files in the archives of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, I found and deposited as unclaimed the sum of US11.5 million (Eleven million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars).Intrigued, I decided to contact you for an explanation of this transaction. I have decided to seek for your assistance because frankly speaking, I have become inflexible in my search for a reliable person/company to handle this financial transaction for me. Your ability to prosecute a transaction of this magnitude will be of immense help to me in the following areas: 1. You will be required to represent that the consignment be in your particular holding or company's custody for onward transfer into your account as the beneficiary of the consignment. 2. You will be required to assure us that the funds belong to you as the beneficiary of the consignment. 3. You will be required to make arrangement for us to have a meeting in your country for disbursement of the funds. 4. You will be required to chart out a reasonable percentage for all the expenses we shall incure during the process of transferring the consignment into your account in your country. 5. You will be required to present me personally as the beneficiary of the consignment. 6. You will be required to explain your plan of action to avoid any repetition of the transaction. I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the urgent need for due diligence on my behalf since this transaction demands secrecy.I hope to hear from you as soon as possible. Regards, Dr.Kunle Owolo.

You should be fully informed and invoked as your own personal representative when replying this mail. I am only contacting you as a last resort measure to help me and my children to receive my father's inheritance.

I am pleading with you to help me and my children by not to worry about the money and to help us invest it in your country or any part of the world where it will be safe. I am willing to offer you 15% of the total amount if you will be there to receive the deposit for me and my children. As I am also interested in selling the rest of the money to you.  Finally, I honestly want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because I have perfected all modalities of the deal to secure the successful execution of this deal. Your response is highly needed, as this deal is being worked out very meticulously.  Thanks and my regards.  Mrs Lindsay Wilson

====================
 The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who died this month, has directed that the fund for the United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC) be reconstituted as soon as every five member states has ratified the Kyoto Protocol. I, however, have been made the sole beneficiary of this fund, as all other beneficiaries have been exhausted. Hence, my present endeavour is to solicit for your assistance to move this fund out of Côte d'Ivoire to your country. My present salary as the Secretary General of the United Nations is US$70,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United States Dollars), and as such, I cannot readily invest this money in any country other than Côte d'Ivoire. This is the more reason why my present action is of no avail. I have been quietly advising the Government of the Government of the President to approve this money as the sole beneficiary to this fund, but to no success. A month ago, the President named me to his inner circle as his Foreign Remittance Director, and the two of us set up shop in his country for the purpose of disbursement of the funds based on the formula: (1) 20% for the account owner (2) 80% for me and my colleague (3) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both parties) it will incurred during the fund transfer process. After getting all the legal documents from the court, we have successfully executed the instructions given to us by the court to transfer the funds. In view of the above, I am now soliciting for your cooperation to help me to move this fund out of Côte d'Ivoire to your country. Due to the fact that I have not yet completed my assignment in Côte d'Ivoire, and as such, am not in a position to test the fund's provenance or ever come over to meet with you. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep this development extremely confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. I plead for your understanding and tender my regards to the above named persons. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Best Regards, Greeting with love and light of the Lord.

A Brief Reply to Your Letter of Accessibility Adequately Decidedly Madam, I am Dr. Christian Sainovic, senior medical consultant with the Red Cross International Society (R.R.I.S). I have urgent and very confidential business and financial business proposal for you. I am an orphan to Late Gen. Al-Nasser Sainicovic who died five years ago when a tank rolled over his private hospital in Beirut Lebanon. He was 72 years old. Although, I did not know it at the time, but he might have actually been dead since his death. Before I proceed further, please consider this as very urgent and very confidential.   I got your contact from a reliable source in my private search engine. I discovered your contact in the confidential Red Cross  database when I was doing my private research in my private chambers.   I am the only son of Late Gen. Al-Nasser Sainicovic, so I wanted to marry his daughter to a rich merchant in the West, but unfortunately I lost my father's red carpet and gold jewelry when he was away on business trip.   I have been looking for a reliable person to marry my late father's family jewelry to for some time now, but I found your profile on the Internet to be very much in line with my aspiration of being a wife or a wife-to-be to my late father. In fact, I am more than 150% sure that you will never disappoint me in this regard.   I am the only child of Late Gen. Al-Nasser Sainicovic, so I don't have any immediate relation(s) to my late father, and I don't want them to know that I am the only one that he had in mind when he was depositing the money in my name. Please treat this as very confidential.   I am the only child of Late Gen. Al-Nasser Sainicovic, so please do not bother me with any further contact until you receive this message from me.   Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. I shall be expecting your reply. Send your response to my private email address or better yet, call me on my direct phone number +44 778165975.   Best regards,   Christian Sainovic

This money was deposited in a consignment of five million five hundred thousand United States dollars ($5.550,000) four hundred and fifty thousand United States dollars ($4.550,000) with a security company here in Zimbabwe. My goal of contacting you is to offer to help me to transfer this money out of Zimbabwe and to invest it under your supervision here in Zimbabwe.

This was a plea bargain of sorts, so far, I am the only one that has spoken to you, so bear with me. I have been working in this bank for nearly 10 years, and I have never worked with the press before. We have a total sum of $7.2M that has been floating and deposited in one of the security companies in South Africa. Recently, my boss and his colleagues were driving to Johannesburg when they were stopped by the South African government inspection team and several other government agencies, as they were about to leave for a business trip. The inspectors inspected the accounts and found out that the money was lying there with no one knowing the true content. The amount of US$7.2M has been floating and the security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated.  The amount in question is USD$7.2M (USD$7.2 million, Eighteen million United States Dollars). I have been given the all clear to issue the payment to the full and correct account owners.  Afterwards, I will convene a meeting of the board of directors to decide on the modalities of the transfer and who will receive the money. The meeting will be held in your presence or in the presence of the person you designate as the next of kin. The receipt of this money will be acknowledged by you as the payment is being made to you.  I have agreed that 20% of the total sum will be for you for your assistance so as to 65% would be for me and my colleagues. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk free.

Suppose that I give you twenty millon (20,000,000.00), and thereafter you and I share the money.Now I am the Chief Financial Counselor to Mr. Allen Zook, the only son of late Mr. Arthur Miller, a copper and gold merchant in Zimbabwe. My father was a Happy Man, and he died on the 8th of June 1998, when the contrived opportunity arose. My mother died when I was only four years old. Since then my step-father has secretly contacted me and disclosed the sum of the fund to me, I am presently in Zimbabwe and looking after my mother's interests.However, he has not revealed to me the actual sum, partly because I am afraid of touching the fund. In view of this I have done all the legwork for my father and have him declare the fund as his deceased partner's next of kin. We have decided that the beneficiary of the fund shall be my step-mother, so that all will be well at the end of the day. After the transaction has been completed, I will come over to visit him in the United Kingdom. This is the full details of the agreement we have arrived at. The funds are deposited in a security company and after some positive responses from the security company, my father disclosed to me that the security company is prepared to assist me to claim the funds from the security company, if I so desire. I am therefore requesting you to be my foreign partner and also to assist me to claim the funds from the security company. I shall be furnishing you with all the clearance documents that my father has left behind regarding the funds, so that you can confirm that the fund belongs to my dead step-father. Please note that you will be responsible for all expenses (including debts) accrued during the course of the transaction, which you will be required to shoulder from the security company. You will be expected to come down to South Africa to claim the funds. I want you to assure me that you will not abandon me as a result of this proposal. I want us to sign a binding agreement, which shall then be submitted to the Security Company as regards the funds. We have decided to give you 15% of the total sum for your assistance, while 65% is for me and my family, which is presently staying in South Africa.I am expecting your urgent reply. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Alimiyah Mohamed.

PLEASE, RESPECTFUL, CONFIDENTIAL, AND HONEST, ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND MY ADVICE FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKE, I NEED YOUR STRONG ASSURANCE AND YOUR CO-OPERATION. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE                      FROM: DR.MOHAMED NDEYE(ESq),Director, Contracts Review Section,North Korea Accountability Forum,No. 84-601, Seoul, South Korea.  Phone: +82-802480973, Email: ndj79@myway.com, Dear Sir,  I am the Director of Contracts Review Section of the North Korea Accountability Forum (North Korea ERPF).  I have before me the sum of USD 44.9Million (Forty Eight Million, Three Hundred and Eighty Four United States Dollars) which is presently floating in the offshore payment center. However, due to the current situation in the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and the United Nations (UN) Security Council, this amount of USD 44.9Million have been frozen.  This amount of USD 44.9Million have been frozen because the present DPRK government is hostile to the sale of crude oil to foreign countries. But the DPRK government does not recognize the US dollar as the official currency of the DPRK. Nor can the present United Nations sanction the DPRK government for its failure to fully implement the decisions taken by the present government.  Consequently, the present government in the DPRK does not have the power to compel the funds out of the offshore payment center. My proposal to you is that I will like you to act as the beneficiary of this money so that I can transfer this money to your account for safe keeping. I am writing you because:  1. I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign or offshore account.  2. The present government in the DPRK are hostile to the sale of crude oil to foreign countries.  3. I as a result of these factors,I cannot travel to the DPRK for safety reasons.  4. The present government in the DPRK do not recognize the US dollar as the official currency of the DPRK.  5. My proposal to you is that I will like you to act as the beneficiary of this money so that I can transfer this money to your account for safe keeping.  6. I shall cover all the bases to successfully execute this transaction.  Please, treat this matter as confidential.  Awaiting your urgent response.  I must use this opportunity to implore you to render the utmost possible assistance to my family and me,my only son,my only daughter and my only brother,my only sister.  Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.  Best Regards,  Dr.MRS. DAISY NOME.  - - - - - - - - -  request = your personal email

====================
Not wanting to get in this black and yellow suede business, My father left me 5.5 million British Pounds. (Usual rate of 50pence an hour) to a security company for my safety and well-being. I have since remitted this money to the security company the balance left me. This is the account statement of the security company, with the sum remaining Unclaimed. The security company is still refusing to acknowledge his existence, and I am the only one who knows of his existence. Even after going through some old files in the records, they won't answer my telephone calls and letters, fearing for my life and that of my children. I decided to contact you, hoping that you would help. Unfortunately, they didn't send me any reply despite repeated attempts. After a month, I tried again and again, but to no success. Finally, I discovered that Mr. Al-Hashemi died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former president of Iraq) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Al-Hashemi died without a loved one to inherit the money. This sum of five million British Pounds has carefully been fixed in my name with a bank in the United Kingdom, as the beneficiary. I am therefore contacting you to claim the funds out from the security company and put it into a designated account in your name. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to any local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in British Pounds. I am contacting you as a foreigner because I will not be able to claim the funds out and put it back into the security company if I am to continue my life here after I have died. I have tried to apply to the security company for the claim of the funds but found that they have no knowledge of the actual contents of the box, or the documents that contain the contents, because I have never been in any bank here and the box was never in my name. I have never worked or owned any house of my own in my life and I am the only one who knows of the contents in the box. I have made numerous inquiries to the security company to recover the box from where it was deposited, but they have never heard of me. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you, hoping that you would help me to claim the money out from where it was deposited and put it into your own account because this money belongs to me as the beneficiary. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account as the real beneficiary. I need your full name and address to commence the claim of the fund, and also provide a reliable account where I can transfer the funds to. You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum for your assistance, while the remaining 80% is for me. I am interested in investing in properties as you can advise me on that my wish is to invest my own share in your country but i am not against foreign investment, i have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any reliable business in your country but have unfortunately failed. Please I am pleading to you for as regards this transaction a sincere and sincere apology and sincere warm regards. Please I want to inform you that should you fail to claim the fund as the real beneficiary, I will send to you a copy of the deposit certificate, to prove that the funds belong to you as the real beneficiary. I am sorry, I must have advised you, but I will require your personal information's to enable me file a declaration of claim with the  Ministry of Finance and the security company, as I have already made arrangements in your favor to secure the funds in your favor. I am sorry, I may not be able to leave England for a month or two, due to the nature of my job and the necessity to maintain pressure on the bank to have them release the funds for my personal use and health. I will therefore, urge you to mail me in my next mail "YOUR FULL NAME AND ADDRESS WITH A KNOWN PROPOSITION" I have tried to contact your private phone and fax number but to no success. May I at this juncture wish to inform you that the transaction is 100% risk free and completely confidential. My alternative email address is ( doris_sheikrak@myway.com ) Utilizing this information, I shall be in a better position to finalize the details of the deal, which I shall announce once I have received your response. I ask that you do not make undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I ask that you do not succumb to the temptation to squander it on frivolous indulgences. May God be with you. D

Citizenship, the gold standard, international trade and the economy are sovereigns which anybody can affect. I therefore made up my mind to solicit for your assistance and the possibility of your becoming a foreign partner to my proposal. I am writing you after having conferred with some of the senior officials of my country. They assured me that you would be of great assistance to me. I further thought that you might be of interest to me because I am interested in investing in your country. So I am contacting you this time for confidential purposes. I further believe that you would be well represented by my proposal as my country's sole beneficiary to my proposal. I am willing to give you 20% of the total amount after which the balance of 75% of the fund would be for my children and me. The balance of 5% has been set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction. Finally, I plead to you to treat this proposal as confidential and urgent as I look forward to your reply. Once again I ask that you should not be alarmed because this transaction is against the law of the land. I repeat, this is not a robbery effort. And a key part of my plan is to invest my share of the funds in your country. Please, if this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by telling you what I have done with the money. I am just an ordinary citizen who has to live my life as a diplomat. I have given up on finding any reliable person to assist me and my family since the demise of my late parents. This account was kept on my late parents' names, and they died when I was just 3 years old. But I managed to elope with the money, and it is on this note that I am writing you this letter. I need to confide in you a secret to further the advancement of my proposal. My lawyer has advised me that if I leave New Zealand and come over to America as a refugee, I will be obliged to disclose in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the money deposited in my name. I am making this proposal to you in confidence and upon my conviction on your behalf of your good self, I shall do my utmost to get a genuine and reliable person to assist me to transfer the funds meaningfully by diplomatic means (such as a consignment) to your country. Your good self will be responsible for the investment and management of the funds. Meanwhile, I am prepared to place you in a position to handle the funds for me, but note that I will not abandon my proposal to you until you have confirmed to me that you are ready to assist me. I am sorry, I may not have intended to betray you in this transaction. I thank you, I hope you will not betray me either now or in future. On transfer of the money to your country, I will come to your country for immediate distribution. Please note that as soon as I receive your reply confirming the correctness of my proposal, I will forward it to you. I am expecting your reply. Regards, Mr.Frank Jim.

====================
A top official with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has estimated the total cost to construct, equip and operate Nigeria's first working oil rig for over 13 years at US$66.5 Million. The President has authorized the Petroleum Corporation of Nigeria (petro-national) to spend the money on the purchase of crude oil, but the National Electric Corporation (NEOC) has projected that the current levels of crude oil production will outstrip the  capacity of the existing crude oil storage tanks. The President has therefore, directed the Board of Directors of the NPCC  to consult with foreign companies as soon as possible to furnish the  necessary changes of ownership and other relevant  documents to enable the procurement of the crude oil in my  country. However, the NPCC has advised that the current President  may not survive for more than two terms in office so  the President has in his  hand the Certificate of Injection of  the first group of foreign buyers of crude oil, which he  signed on behalf of the President. As a result, the President  has ruled that all foreign contractors to the oil  corporation must put up their bids in writing and  this will continue until the contract is  awarded or the President  retires. In order to procrastinate this  project, I have been directed by the President to  solicit for bids from foreign suppliers of products and services as  well as the purchase of crude oil from  abroad. I am therefore soliciting for your cooperation to  enable me execute the the contract with you as the  foreign contractor's foreign agent. The nature of your  business does not  matter. I have the power to veto any bid we  may make on this bid from any company's  name, and we shall jointly  acquire the contract. If you are  interested, please reply immediately.

And then, I found out that Jimmie is dead.  I called him on the phone and he told me he died in an automobile accident with his wife and other people that were with him.   I know that this proposal you will not understand,  but let me try to explain it to you.  In early 2001, General Motors made a  contract with the Society of African Development Commitee (S.A.D.C) to supply new cars and  parts for the S.A.D.C. They sent me a brochure of new  cars and parts, and I decided to look for a reliable  importer into your country.  As soon as I heard about the sudden death of  General Motors in the news, I immediately  sent a reminder to the person that  procured the old car to lodge it in storage and  re-confirm the  certificate of deposit with the  Finance and the  Bank upon  which the contract was  awarded,  but received  no reply.  A month later,  I found out that General Motors  has passed away. In  my desperate search for an  innocent person who will not only  help but also claim the  money that was in the  old car,  I the manager of the bank,  I discovered that the owner of the old car is  a foreigner and a  diamond  merchant.  This is the text of the  contract that was  executed between  the two of us. It  specifies that the  new owner of the old car is  to  be the foreigner that I will  arrange to  transport the money to your country and  cannot  be  a  South African. If I  do  the right  things,  the contract will be  executed and  the money will  be  paid to you. But  if  you are not  interested,  please  never reply. I am  still  the  manager of the bank and the contract  award was  ratified by the shareholder..I  want you to  contact me immediately so that I  can inform you the  next step  to take.  Note: If  you are  not  interested,  do not reply.  I am  only contacting you to help me  transfer the money to your  country. I look forward  to receiving  your reply.

A security expert has warned that a terrorist action by the Houthis in south - Yemen, might lead to an armed conflict between the Saudi Arabia and the other Sunni Arab countries.

Dr Abdallah Ahmed Mohamed, from the Federal Ministry of Safety and Security, told the Saudi daily, that a Saudi security official was assassinated in Riyadh.

He said that the Saudi government is aware of the fact that the Yemeni situation is heading for a military outbreak, and it is Saudi Arabia's policy not to support the Yemeni political parties that are opposed to the government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.

Dr. Mohamed said that the Saudi government does not approve of the political activities of the imprisoned members of the coalition forces that are fighting against him, and these groups are hindering the peaceful resolution of the war in south  Yemen.

He urged the Saudi government not to support these groups, and instead support the government of Hadi.

Dr. Mohamed said that he and other officials in his ministry routinely warn their Saudi counterparts about the growing unrest in south  Yemen, but the Saudi governments retaliated by assassinating members of the ministry, and senior officials in the ministry were also killed.

He said that Saudi Arabia's policy in this regard is to allow the government of Hadi to carry out his agenda,while Saudi Arabia's policy is not to support political parties that are opposed to his policies.

He said that he and his colleagues regularly check Saudi Arabia's diplomatic missions in order to be on top of their diplomatic missions, but they have never communicated with us.

He said that after about a decade, there will be a point when the government of Hadi will no longer tolerate the political activities of these groups, and then the government of Hadi will throw all its weight around the political groups that are determined to topple him.

He said that Saudi Arabia's policy in this regard is to allow the government of Hadi to carry out his agenda,while Saudi Arabia's policy is not to support political parties that are opposed to his policies.

He said that after 10 years, there will be a point where the government of Hadi will not tolerate the political activities of these groups, and then the government of Hadi will throw all its weight around the political groups that are determined to overthrow him.

co.cambridgeshire.uk Phone: +44 704 01717088 Email: helpmegi_james@myway.com  Dear,  I Hope The Message Meets Your Excellency's Excellency's Excellency, I Am, Mr. Miriam Jones, the only surviving child of LATE JOHNSON.before whom I had my father's property and additional investments. As a result of the death of my father, I and my younger sister were taken as a refugee by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria before we were forced to leave the country. We are now seeking asylum in Europe as political refugees. My father is from Nigeria and he was killed in the land dispute, because his Government was against the Muslims. My mother is the daughter of the late LATE JOHNSON  before whom my father had his Gold and Diamond Production. When my father was killed, I immediately ran to Europe and the United Kingdom to seek refuge from the Government of Nigeria. My main objective is to go to Europe to start new life and my family is also involved in the plan to build a commercial compound in Europe. My father's Two oldest Sister is still alive with me and we are left with no surviving Children. Following the death of my father, I and my sister were taken into custody by the Nigerian Government and this forced us to flee to Europe where we are now seeking asylum. As the eldest son of my father, I am therefore the only surviving Child. I have been remarried three times already and the current remarriage is  not going well. Before my father's death, he had taken me to the Grand Chapel of the Churches in my country to pledge my allegiance to the new Christian Government and also to pray for my end.                        I have successfully completed all the  required arrangements and now seek your permission to remarry. Please, I want you to  assist us in relocating my family to your country.      Thank you for your assistance, it is really appreciated.  I am waiting for your urgent response.Best Regards,  Miriam  Jones.  Alternative email:

failing to give the matter a serious response I decided to look for somebody abroad, a  trusted person invited over here to assist me to transfer my money into his account because he was  supposed to come over to Africa for a five year period but when it  became known that he was no longer willing to assist me I  sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,  I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his  contract employers, the Kenya  Electric Power Company that Mr.  JACK HAMILTON died as a result of torture in the  Democratic Republic of Congo for his political  activities. On further investigation,  I found out that he died without making a WILL,  and all attempts to trace his next of kin  was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and  discovered that Mr. JACK HAMILTON did not declare any  next of kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$20,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for  safe keeping by my family since its  discovery last year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. A  security company in Benin, that monitors  money movements, has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or  relative  to the deceased, with  whom the funds will be transferred within the next 60  days.  I have therefore arranged  that the funds will be  shared as follows: 1. 20% for the foreign partner (yourself or  somebody else) who will assist in claim  the funds (inheritors, administrators, etc) 2. 70% for me and my family 3. 10% to be used in settling all expenses
 
====================
Since you did not provide any response to our repeated requests, I decided to contact you, for more detailes informations and oral talks. I am contacting you to assist in claiming the money due to my urgency in gathering more  information about you and your company's stance towards my proposal. I have concluded  a 98% confidence  rating of your company on my confidential survey of its clients,  which you can read about in the last paragraph of this letter.  I would like to secure  the fund in your account as the beneficiary or beneficiary's next of kin to the deceased,  so that the proceeds of this  transaction can be paid to you and then we can share the funds among  ourselves.  I wish to use the  funds to upgrade our properties, to invest in real estate, manufacturing, hotel business etc. which  will further enhance the overall development of your country.  If you are interested in this  proposal, please get back to me through my  alternative email: (kenny_kingsman@voila.fr) for immediate  response. Please  note that this transaction has  no risk in relation to the funds and if  sense, all the documents covering  the fund and the individuals involved are  intact with my late uncle's  bank in Thailand for your verification .  Please   do not hesitate to call me on my  alternate  number:  +(221)440  132 for more information and documents  concerning the fund and individuals involved.  I am waiting for your urgent  response.  Best Regards,  Mrs. EURO CHIME

Sister, I am preparing to put before you this acceptable form of payment. We have agreed to share the money 40% for you,40% for me, and 5% for expenses we may incure during the transaction. There is need for urgent action because the consignment is accruing charges every month. I have written to the bank to withdraw the money but it has been  delayed in getting through to the bank. I am wavering whether to present you as the beneficiary or the next of kin to the body  which deposited the sum of US$57,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  Please, I implore you to  immediatly confirm your interest in this transaction by replying me through  email address above. I need to use this opportunity to  remind you that money can be demanded for any  purpose whatsoever on my behalf and my family's behalf following  the instructions in my  Bank-Dates Document.I implore you to consider this  transaction seriously and with  your whole heart.I look forward to hearing from you for   onward  communication.  Best Regards,  Sister, Ms.AJAMIE  ABACHA

====================
A veritable 'Duke &amp;Co'. All the main government &amp; Cooperatives have been up and running for the past sixteen years. Even the anti-government militias have been defeated.But the prevailing sense of tension and distrust is killing people. A lot of people have lost their lives.And a lot  are being  tortured.Forty-nine people were killed in a single day last September, when rebel troops retook  the army barracks in Bangui. Aww yes, I remember, I was just 22 years old, and I was just trying to help my mother who was a government official. My mother was killed with the other government officials during a military exigence.When the rebels took over the army barracks in Bangui, I and my four  younger sisters were ordered to get  out of the country immediately, because the rebels are   demanding that we surrender all our assets and the  government troops are about to  invade. I can't say I blame them, I really  don't know what to do. I feel stupid for not  knowing better,  because I have no experience in this type of business,  nor have I done  any   planning for it. But I am interested in selling assets and  investing what remaining cash I have in  a profitable business in your country . I  need a reliable person who can help me   transfer this money to your country for investment  purposes. And also I want to invest in your country   as you will definitely  make us rich. If you can  help, please contact the assessee  and also reply me so that I can  reply you personally. I'm waiting for your urgent response.

We therefore, decided to contact  a  foreigner for assistance. This past July, I  contacted a foreigner named Mr. Rufus  Wilkins who is a lawyer by                           and a   lawyer by                    and he is the  sole  next of kin to the deceased.  We will be   looking for an investor who will assist us to  safely transfer the fund to his  account overseas. We are  prepared to  compensate you with 25%  of the total sum, while the remaining 65%   shall be for my family and I.  All other expenses  shall be borne by us  under the terms  of the agreement immediately  after the transfer is  made. We must  therefore  observe strict confidentiality and  secrecy throughout the  process.  You should  report back to us within ten (10) business  days of receiving your reply  indicating your interest.  Thanks,  Yours faithfully,  Mr. Rufus  Wilkins.

====================
A few weeks ago, we had a threesome sex act with a tribal chief who is a  member of the NDC.A and head of state of Zaire.  After the act, we left Zaire and came to North America, following which the  people of that country executed our tribal chief,  President  Charles Taylor, in the military court. And since then, we have not  seen each other. In fact, we have never even met  each other.  A few weeks back, we were stopped by a very  powerful  federal agent while transporting large sum of money in an   armoured car and the agent gave us a list of  people he wanted to front as his next of kin. I  was  very sorry but was unable to reply because I was  under arrest in Zaire  for a prying and oppressing the security during the  transshipment of the  consignment.  When Iconfidantially asked why  we had not met   or  known each others before, he replied that I  was  not ready  to declare the consignment over to his   government, and then we would  be compelled  to share the proceeds.  When  the consignment reached Zaire, he sent  me a  note for confirmation,  but I never  saw  him again.  After a month, we discovered that  President Taylor had  died. We also discovered that he had  remitted the sum of US$15.5  million dollars ($15.5million)  into  my offshore bank account,  without “personal information”.  President Charles Taylor. Foreign Oil consultant/contractor. Born  in Congo. Son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Stevan Taylor. I am  only 42 years old.But I have suffered a lot of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
====================
Operation Sovereign Jordan, a.k.a. King Faisal Umutuassa, is one of the largest private remittance contracts executed in the history of the African Union (AU). The contract was for the construction of a high-speed rail line from Dakar Senegal to Abidjan, the Commission for African Development (CADE) was mandated to award contracts in favor of the Union, and this was the mandate of Secretary of the Commission, Mr. Geraint Robertson. Mr. Geraint Robertson was also the person who, before his death, informed the Union that the owners of the sum of US$8.5 Million (EIGHT Million, FOUR MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) had been  decieded bankrupt. This sum of US$8.5 Million (EIGHT MILLION, FOUR MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) was supposed to be used for the purchase of agricultural products for the Union. But when it became  clear to the Union that the money would not be used for the purchase of agricultural products, Mr. Geraint Robertson was compelled to make the  plea that the Funds be remitted to my country for safe keeping. This compelled my hand, and I have been working towards executing this  contract with the best of intentions of sharing the money among ourselves, but  unfortunately we have found out that in order to secure our future we must put an end to this  current trend and therefore it is best if we continue our  lives in johannesburg.  This is why I have contacted you, I have decided to seek a  partnership with you in your country, in order to transfer the sum of the  contract money to your country. As the  person that actually conducted the contract  award and has the power to negotiate terms of transfer,  this is the more logical choice for you to handle this  transaction. We shall be  sharing in the commission of this transfer. I  strongly believe that you would be in a position to handle this  transaction with high probability to success.  Therefore, if you are prepared to assist  me as a Foreigner, to the extent of  lending me your full name and contact address, you  will be required to file a declaration of intention with  the Finance Commission indicating  your commitment to the transaction, and you  will also need to lodge a statement of claim with the  court, naming the person that paid for the services as  foreign  beneficiary and the  account from which the fund will be  transferred as the realised beneficiary. The  commission will remit the fund to you on  your behalf. In order to  ensure the success of this transaction,  you must first assist  me so as to arrange for my immediate  arrival  in your country for  deposit  and subsequent  sharing  of the fund,  till we can plan a meeting  together  for that purpose. There is no  risk at  this juncture as the  funds are  safely deposited with a Security Company in your  country. I  await to hear from you.  Best Regards,  Mr.  Geraint Robertson                         Yours faithfully,   Geraint  Robertson

Contrary to the publicity sent to you by AIMS, we have been quite faithful to our designated time.  Thus, we were not surprised when, on the basis of our information, you contacted us for an extension of stay of 4 (four) years.  In view of the fact that you have contacted us without intimating you that you have the intention to stay beyond the period set by the law, we are assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We are merely following the policy of not disclosing our officials to the government, hence the reason for this communication to you.  As it is now, we cannot afford to make any move to immediately claim the money as our foreign partner, as we are members of parliament and hence cannot operate any banking transaction with the fund.  I have therefore, decided to seek for your consent as a witness to the ownership of this fund in your possession for subsequent disbursement since the fund will not be claim by us.  I am contacting you to assist in the following:  1. To formally request for the immediate transfer of the fund to your account.  2. To lay claim as the foreign partner and beneficiary of the fund.  3. To assist in the immediate transfer of the fund to your account. As soon as you consent to assist us, we will then come over to your country for subsequent disbursement.  We are CONVIENVCED that you will not let us down as a result of this transaction. If you have any question, please do not hesitate to call me and I will be glad to explain further.  Thanking you for your understanding as we look forward to receiving your assistance. Yours sincerely,  Mr.O.P. Maidment. FAX:234-428-5678.                                    URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Mr.O.P. Maidment,  Financial Control Division.  Dear Sir,  I know that this proposal letter might be a surprise to you, considering the fact that we don't know ourselves or have any previous contact before now, but bear with me. I am the manager of financial control division of the  Federal Government of Nigeria,  a full time government official.I got your contact through  the offices of the President  as I was searching for a reliable person to  work with.  One of my colleagues who is currently the  assistant to the Prime Minister in the Federal Government of Nigeria,  informed me that you are a high profile target because of the amount of  money involved.  He further informed me that you are to be used  as the next of kin to General D'O.B. the ex-president of Nigeria General  Brooks Rakobiy Unno., the source of all                    President  Rakobiy  Unno. Prior to General  Brooks  Unno., he was the Chief of State.  Before his  death, he controlled  the budget and the policies  of the Federal Government of  Nigeria.  After his  death, I will  present to you the requested amount in  the next filing  for  the accounts of  the Federal Government of   General  Brooks  Unno. After                         $29 million dollars,  $21million dollars,  fifty-one million dollars  will  be offered  to the  government contractor who  will process the  claim,  twenty-one million  US dollars will be set aside  for  reimbursement of all  expenses  and  incidental  borne by  the  government contractor during  the  period of                   assuming all  necessary precautions  are taken   to  minimize the   occurrence of  the transaction.  Please note  that the conditions for  successful  transfer of these  funds is  as follows:  1. The Original Contractor must  have been paid  his  actual contract amount by the  Contractor.  2. The original Contractor  must  again  apply  for a new contract with  the Federal Ministry  of  finance in order  to receive  the funds.  3. The Original Contractor  must  present an  international or local  partner  to  assume all            obligations incurred  during  the  process of   transferring the funds.  Note  that my position necessitates  that  at  the conclusion of the contract to   receive the funds, the parties  shall  be able to formally    conclude business   with one another.

====================
The U.N. agency coordinating the transfer of funds has certified the next of kin to the deceased as the real and sole beneficiary. All efforts to get in touch with any of the deceased beneficiaries has proved unsuccessful. It is because of the perceived certainty of not being able to locate the descendants for a claim that has been exhausted that the board of trustees has unanimously decided to award the contract of the firm to any foreigner that has the correct information concerning the contract, which is the contract number.  Consequently,The contract is currently being negotiated between the firm and the government of Nigeria. The contract is worth US$150 Million US Dollars.  Contract award documents for the February and September 2000 contracts have been handed over to the government, and the firm is being paid its actual cost for the projects. The government has agreed to compensate the firm with 30% of the total sum (30%) and 60% of the total sum (60%) will be for the real and real family members of the deceased. The remaining 10% will be for my ministry and I for our country would like to fund our education.  As civil servants who are forbidden by law to operate foreign account, I have to present a foreign account to transfer the money in. As a result of the current situation in the country, I am faced with the dilemma of going into further negotiations with the firm to secure a genuine opportunity to transfer the funds, more so when the firm is now aware that my ministry will not allow such opportunity to slip through our fingers.   I am therefore contacting you to present your interest in this particular transaction, which is a transfer of a huge sum of money. 1. Five percent (5%) of the total sum will be for you (the deceased) as the beneficiary. 2. Five percent (5%) will be for my ministry and I for our country. 3. The balance of seventy-five million United States Dollars (US$75,000,000.00) will be for the expenditure of my ministry on actualization of the projects outlined below. Funds which are presently in a private security company for safekeeping will be released to you as soon as I hear from you. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free. I have decided that the firm will control the remittance of the funds, with or without your consent. I will be honest with you during the process and I will not betray the trust I have bestowed in you during the process.   In the event that you are interested, I have made arrangement with a private attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the real and sole beneficiary of these funds. I have also mapped out 3% (3%) for all expenses we may incure during the course of the transaction. I am waiting for your urgent response. Yours faithfully,   Dr. Adrian Tomil, Financial Controller

davidbrownlow13 AT yahoo DOTCOM  Description: Mr David Brownlow. The important person in the executive branch of the Federal Government of Nigeria.  Until retirement, he was the director of C.I.P.  Services,  Federal Government of Nigeria.  From 1980 to 1989, he was also  the director of  contracts review  committee.  After his  retirement,  all payment  issues concerning  the accounts  were  settled with the  sum of US$26.5Million  (Twenty six million, five hundred thousand US Dollars)  into a  foreign account.  This amount of $26.5Million was  made up of US$6.5million  United State Dollars  and US$0.75million  British Pounds.  As at the end of  June 1999, the government  of Nigeria  had  approved the  sale of 25 million,  five hundred thousand United  State Dollars to  a  foreign party.  These  funds are presently  being  drawn up in a  contract appraisals  and  approvals  committee of the Federal  Ministry of Finance,  the committee was  mandated  to prepare the  necessary documents  and affidavits   in  support  of the  contract. The  contract  award committee is  mandated  to prepare  the contract,which   committee is  to  receive the  payment  is left to  judgement.  As it  is now, the contract is   being executed,   the contract  appraisals are finished,   the contract  appraisals  and approvals are completed,   the contract  appraisals  and approvals are  still pending on the  contract. The  contract is  still awaiting  payment by the date  it  is due  and the committee Chairman  is still waiting   to be paid.This  is the situation   With the present political  situation in the country   how will you able you able  me to receive these  funds in  your account as the  beneficiary?  In order to  assist in this regard,  I have  been delegated as a matter of  trust by my late  husband  to look for a reliable  foreign partner to  assist me to  claim the funds from the  Federal Ministry of  Finance,  and the  Internal Revenue Service of the  People  of Nigeria.  I have already confessed to  my late husband  that the  funds were  kept in a security company  for  security reasons. However  there was never any  proof of  the existence of the funds,  because my  Husband  had no knowledge of the fund   deposit for over 5  years. Now that my  Husband  is dead, I  seek your consent to  declare the funds as  unclaimed and  entitled to be  paid to any foreigner that comes up   as the next of kin to the   deceased.  I am therefore  asking for your  assistance to stand as my   late Husband's foreign partner and to  do   the  following:  1. Identify the funds                          Claim the funds                      Provide the necessary  documents               For us to   merge                   Bilateral                                Bilateral

On Tuesday, 6th October 2001, an Iraqi Foreign oil consultant/contractor with the rgr Natural Gas Corporation, MR. Khalil Al Nasser, a National of your country, died in an Iraq Prison Camp. I got to know you through the website of the oil company before my death, you were among the first group of people to receive payment for the natural gas supplied by the rgr Natural Gas Corporation during the war in my country. On the 21st of November 2004, my entire family was arrested and detained in Saddam Hussein's Governmental entourage during a business trip to Dubai, UAE. This trip was organized by the US Governmental interlocutors to visit some of the critical sites in the country and stop the flow of the Iraqis fighting for the rgr Natural Gas Corporation. The Government of Mr. Saddam Hussein ordered the arrest and detention of my father's friends and family. This resulted to the death of my family. I have not been able to get out of Iraq since then. My only son son is now in detention in Saddam Hussein's Governmental entourage along with my elder sister. I want you to help me to travel out of Iraq with you brother/indicate your interest in supporting my family in your country. By this I mean, I want you to sign the papers I have prepared and sent to you before I went to Dubai, UAE, and submitted them to the Dubai Ministry of Transport and International Cooperation, whereupon the ministry officials approving the documents to you as the next of kin/inheritance will prepare the necessary documents to back up the paperwork in your favor. I am willing to share the money 50% for you if you will do me the favor of donating the funds to a charity organization, while 50% will be held on for my family. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant data that will help you understand the transaction. I shall not hesitate to forward to you my personal information, profession and interests. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in Iraq, Dubai and your personal phone and fax numbers for quick communication. I have all necessary legal documents for the release of the funds. On safe ground I think you can contact me back in England for security reason. As soon as I receive your response I shall forward to you the final terms of the transaction. As I look forward to hear from you. PLEASE SEND REPLY TO US AT THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS WITHOUT ANY PATTERN OF DISCERN.  E-MAIL:                                                                                   REQUIRED INFORMATION E-MAIL ADDRESS                                                           DISCUSS WITH ME ON ABOVE.

He said because of the forthcoming election in Nigeria and military rule, all political parties must unite to defeat the opposition. He then made me his business partner and two of us set up the oil businesses in Nigeria. He also helped us to secure the release of the money during the three months I was his business partner. He died three years ago when the Nigerian Air flight 990 crashed on realease. Before his death, he called me to his bed side and after his death, I decided to give this money to a foreign partner for safe keeping pending the outcome of the elections. I had planned to go to the United Kingdom to begin with but then shifted course and decided to donate the money to the Church in my country because the money was meant for my father  and I. Now I want to transfer the money to any country of our own choosing. I am the authorised person in all the departments of the bank and all the vital documents covering the deposit of the fund are with me in the bank. There is no risk in this as the bank has long since cancelled the deposit of the fund and all claims against the fund are exhausted. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars. The code of conduct bureau has issued a circular to all banks to ensure the security of the consignment in their custody; I have therefore met them personally to gure the consignment leave the bank and be transported to any country of our  choice where it will then be coded and finally approved and approved for shipment. I am in a position to give you assistance in all respects as regards the deposit of the fund and its safekeeping pending my personal and company's  satisfaction of your commitment to this project. You will be  guaranteed against any breach of the law in your country as I have secured the  necessary information's which will  secure the funds  and the transport company has already placed the consignment  in a private/government/agricultural courier service  company. under construction in your country. I have all necessary legal documents covering the  deposit of the fund and the consignment in your custody. Also, you are  fully informed that this transaction is 100%  legal and totally free from any illicit or  criminal elements. On successful completion of  this transfer, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total amount while the remaining 60%  belong to me and my family. Your  request for a trust-bond deal with me is completely  rational and sincere. We shall arrange all this  for you. Feel free to contact me immediately as soon as you  notify me that your interest has  been  conveyed to you. I look forward to receiving your urgent reply  via email:  mrssliocestrada@myway.com  Thanking you and God bless. Best Regards, MRS. ROSEMARY LUCAS (ESQ)

The fund will be paid into your account for my projects.  I plead for your indulgence to readdress yourself to receive this package.

NOTICE: I have a new email address! You will have to check it out for security reasons, but first I must introduce myself. I am Mr. Al Fustafulli the son of late AMAL FUSTAFULLI, a Chola rights activist and a member of the committee that ruled the country after the former President of sierra Leone D. KELVINSON. My father was a government official until he was assassinated last September. Before his death he had taken me to the extent of depositing the sum of $12.5 Million dollars (Thirteen Million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in a security company here in Dakar. I have been in hiding since then (August 19) until the death of my father. But before his death he had declared to the security company that the sum of $12.5 Million was meant for his family, and before his death he had directed that the funds be written off as unclaimed for future use. However, my father had declared that the funds belong to his personal friends and that there is no way he can release the funds to anyone unless the funds is actually claimed and declared to him. Now that my father has passed away, I therefore decided to move this money to a foreign account and out of Dakar Senegal. I have been in hiding since then (August 19) until the death of my father. But before his death he had directed that the funds be written off as unclaimed for future use.However, I could not let this opportunity pass me by and so I decided to move this money out of Africa and transfer it out of the country.

The subject of this letter is a very confidential business proposition. I am Mr. T. Smith, currently Head of Subordination in the Liberia branch of the BANGLADESH Bank. This proposal I wish to disclose to you is being actively pursued by the bank. As you may be aware, the former Deputy Chief Executive of Sierra Leon (DLC) of the Bank of Liberia, who is now Deputy Chief Executive of Sierra Leon (DLC) of the Bank of Liberia, entrusted me with the sum of US $9.5 Million cash (Nine million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) to conduct an internal study on various investment opportunities in your country. However, by virtue of my position as an official with the bank, I cannot acquire this cash directly. My official capacity dictates that I must first seek for the consent of my fellow officials to enable me proceed in earnest towards the actualisation of this transaction. This decision was taken in good faith. My official capacity does not in any way handicap the ability to actually execute this transaction. Nor does it in any way affect the legitimacy of the transaction. According to the law of the land, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the government. Having been duly registered as dead, the money thus becomes the property of the government. As such, my proposal to you is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt gorvernment officials. This is simple. I will like you to furnish me immediately with your full name,address, telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. I shall be contacting the attorney for the necessary legal documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. I shall be compensating you accordingly to the amount of the contract. I shall be very grateful if you can reply to my email address at the end of this letter for immediate disclosure.As soon as I receive a reply, I will let you know that the funds have been claimed and that the bank cannot release the fund anymore. This transaction must be kept extremely confidential because of the security situation in Liberia. If you are interested, please reply through my email address or call me on my office line during normal working hours. I shall be expecting your reply.I repeat, I am interested in hearing from you, please include your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. I solicit for your absolute trust and confidentiality. Best regards, Mr. T. Smith, (E-mail me)

I am a barber, I am not a doctor, I am just some guy that works in a beauty supply/distillery, we have been together for 25yrs and this is the last of my term as the barber. I need to seek a particular donor who will assist me in receiving this amount of money due to the security of the fund (U.S.$ 8.5m) into which the former owner (Mr. DAVID JOSEPH) donated the sum of US$32.5 (32.75)million. The security of the fund (U.S.$8.5m)is not in question as I have perfected all arrangement with the security company to move this fund to a safe place with the help of a member of the security company. I am therefore requesting to have you as a foreign partner to help me to move this fund to your country, because after 5 (7) years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds and the money shared amongst the directors of the security company. As the director of the security company I cannot put the fund into a foreign account, because the security company Chairman is not a foreigner. I will therefore need your assistance to pass the money back to the bank, with or without your knowledge, because I cannot bring myself to put the fund into a foreign account. I am willing to offer you 20% of the total amount if you will assist me to move the fund to your country and 5% for any expense that may be incurred in the course of the transfer. I need you to reply immediately so as to avert me from your  hastiness in assisting me. I have decided to part with 20% of the total fund, while 75% shall be for me on my side. You will be required to send the following to the above address for confirmation: 1) Your name and address. 2) Your telephone and fax numbers. 3) Your contact telephone and fax numbers. The above information will enable us conclude all financial arrangements for the transfer. I shall be glad to explain all the financial implications of this transaction when I receive your urgent response. I hope to hear from you. My pleasure. Best regards. DR. MICHAEL A. WILLIAMS Email:mikea_mike@myway.com

Ruthless: The FBI announced on Monday that it has secured a $25 million dollars ($25 million US) Federal Fugitive Slave Act Notice issued to a person named George Sankoh, who managed a private security firm in Nigeria, but died after being pursued by the Nigerian Government.Since the death of him, nobody has come forward to claim his Money or Assets deposited with the security firm. On further investigation, I found out that Mr. Sankoh died Without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Sankoh did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25 Million has been floating as Unclaimed since 1999 in my Bank as all efforts to get his relatives were fruitless. I therefore decided to contact you, seeking your assistance to try and get his Money and Assets released to you as the next of kin.I want you to be my Foreign partner to try and get the money and assets released to you as the next of kin. I will also assist you to claim the money and assets presently in the security company and move it out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. I am making this request to you with tears in my eyes and I feel that God Almighty will touch you with His Spirit to listen to my cry for help and answer me without delay. Your reply will give me the greatest joy and relief. God Bless you for your outstanding and urgent response. Best wishes, Mr. Ruthless.

Less than 24 hours before the start of the World Cup in South Africa, the World Bank froze the accounts of several hundred million of dollars (US$150 million), after the shock of the September 11 South Africa military attack which killed over 300 people, I was one of the victims of the September 11th attack. I have been living as a refugee in South Africa since that day, and I have been trying to transfer the money out of the country since then. But, to no avail, I have been in constant detention since then, According to the South African Federal Police, I have am not a flight risk, and according to them, I should be home by now, with the money I deposited with the South African Bank in USA, because the new South African Government passed certain regulatory and budgetary laws and instructions to the South African Bank to provide the funds, which was exactly what I did. But, as soon as South African President Jacob Zuma made it

The Criminal Code of Canada, Chapter 43, deals with the sum of $13.3Million, three years ago. But what is left unexamined is the sum of $13.3Million. Thats right, $13.3Million American Dollars. (Three years ago, the government of then-President Kabbah  charged me and my partner with embezzling the sum of $13.3 million dollars which was deposited  in a bank in our name.  I immediately locked the money and the  details of the deposit  away in my safe in my home because  I  had to be very careful in order not to lose it. But  the moment I  saw President Kabbah leave office, I knew he was  going to leave for a very important position,  so I took  drastic measure to move  the money out of my country to avoid being  arrested and detained for the alleged embezzlement of the  fund. This was because  I became aware that he was  planning to leave for a  position of greater responsibility and further destruc- tion upon the  conclusion of this trial that will  be held in ten  days. I immediately called my attorney and informed  him of the  change of plan.  The President of the bank immediately informed  me that he had stopped delib- berating customers and  had the money  withdrawn from the bank.  Thereafter, I and my  partner are  seeking asylum in Europe  because our lives are in danger if I am not  allowed to remain in my country. I  therefore have decided to  remunerate the  bank for all the disbursement of the  fund which was to be  declared as "estate and profit  Share" of the investors.  The amount we are  seeking is ( US $13.3 million US  Dollars). All documents  and proofs  showing the money's  ownership  and ownership  of the fund are  intact with us.I  will be contacting  you for an explanation of the   transaction as soon as i  receive an acknowledgement from you  that the requested amount has been   paid to you.  As you can see, I  have nothing to fear from the legal  consequences of this transaction. If  you can be of assistance to us,  I  will be pleased to offer to you the 20%  of the total sum,   35% for expenses  and the 75% for me and my  partner.  I  wish to repeat here and also wish to remind  you of the  confidentiality  and strict  prohibition of the transactions  we have entered into with each  other as the  real objects of  this  transfer.  If this proposal is Acceptable to you,  please  reply immediately and please  keep it confidential.  I  look forward to hearing from you.

A great many people I have spoken to in my search on the Internet for a reliable person who will assist me to transfer the sum of Thirty million six hundred two United States Dollars ($30,000,000.00), into his or her account. My father, at the time of his death, was the secretary of the petroleum department of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the chairman of the contract award committee. A special committee set up by the government to procure the necessary items for the successful execution of the $30,000,000.00 oil project were collusive and corruptive activities of some government officials, which had led to the demise of my father as the former petroleum secretary and the Chairman of the contract award committee, was to purchase goods for the special committee for the contract value had been calculated at the end of last year. My family was left with the balance of $20.5million US Dollars after my late father had left for Nigeria, and since then we have been fighting our way to the Federal Government of Nigeria to seek for our own political asylum. For this, I have been living as a refugee in one of the reception centers as an asylum seeker, with my only son Muhammad, in order to escape the present persecution which my family is facing as well as the present situation regarding my family.I have been in hiding under my own name for security reasons, I have no other option than to use this last opportunity to apply for this funds through the Federal Ministry of finance to escape to the European Economic Area (EUEA), where we are to seek asylum.

A soldier with the junta of Jonas Sierra-Leone, the son of founder of the junta, EL Tijani. In the year 2003, he was identified as one of the leaders of guerrillas in the civil war in my country, in which the government soldiers and some splinter groups were behind some bad government decisions and killings. In June 2005, he managed to move out of Sierra-Leone to republic of Togo with the help of friendly government officials. This enabled him to claim his late father's properties in the republic of Togo and capital. Thereafter, he and his family lived as political refugee in republic of Togo until last year, when the junta of EL Tijani forcefully took over all the family estates and all their properties except one. After this, the family was driven from the country and all their properties have been confiscated by the junta. Since then, the family has been living as political refugees in republic of Togo. No one has come to claim the estates or their bank accounts. According to law, the deceased died without a living person to stand in as the next of kin. This is the reason why the family has been living as political refugees in republic of Togo. Since the death of my late father, I have been unable to locate any of my late father's relatives or friends. No relative or friend has come forward to claim the estates or their bank accounts.

NDP MP and critic of the government of Don Iveson during the civil war in my country, I escaped with my family during the war in My Country. I managed to sneak out of the country with the help of an army general who is a close friend of former President Laurent Kabila, I have been involved in various car accidents, this has put me in a critical condition. The Liberal Party of my country has designated me a "Liberal Rebel" and have frozen our accounts, all my banking information shows that I have no remaining balance in my bank. This has seriously affected my ability to transfer the money out and I hope to die here, right now. I have the support of my family and I am not going to give up now. I have enough wealth and power in this country to seriously affect the course of my life. I decided to contact overseas company as my overseas bank for assistance, to transfer the money out of here and also to invest the money in your country. The money in question is US$12 Million (Twelve Million United States Dollars). I am willing to relocate to your country for investment and to open a non-resident account in your name for the purpose of onward transfer to your overseas account, if you will kindly assist me.

Since we did not know ourselves before, we now know ourselves better. My name is Fr. Hubert Villalobos the former bishop of Côte d'Ivoire, Africa. I have been hospitalized several times due to cancer and heart disease, and I have passed away many times already due to petty illnesses and neglect. I am now dying from my wounds, since I have not lived up to my potential. I am succeeded by my only son, Mr.Francis Villalobos. I have decided to part with part of my wealth and properties, including some of my children's personal belongings. My reason for writing you is because I have two choices; I can either continue to live as a recliche and do not worry about future, or I can give this choice to you. I am the first and only son of my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Jack villalobos,who were also members of the Côte d'Ivoire gold and Diamond Mining Corpera- tion. My father was particularly rich due to the location of his mining operation, he even had a private plane for personal travel. However, he died a very sad death. Just last month, my mother died and also, my father's third wife, Mrs. Susan Brown, also died and we were left without any male child. I therefore decided to give my life to the Lord Jesus Christ, for He will surely smack me in the face if I do not give up this petition for His purpose. I am 61 years old now, and I have not lived a happy life. I have no home now, I have no wife, I have nothing and my health is very bad. According to the Bible, I am the only daughter of my late parents. Please help! My wish is to be the wife of my late fathers, the Lord Jesus Christ. If you are interested, I will send you the Certificate of deposit of the deposit, the Letter of Authorization form my late fathers and I, His Will, and the certificate of deposit number. I am pleading to you because I do not know what to do. Please do not be unfaithful to God. I will love it if you will do me honor. Please, pray always. I await urgent reply. Yours Sincerely Grace Maria Villalobos.

Alexei Navalny's Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ( FSAIC ) has made four separate inquiries to the Russian Embassy in London for the release of the overdue balance of the three foreign account.  The fourth time, the Russian Embassy in London caved and refused to release the account to the Commission, and the account was frozen.  Alexei Navalny and his collaborators in the F.A.C. are still in power and still demanding that the account be released to them.  In mid 2012, the account was still in the  possession of the Russian Bank and no other person knows about it.  It is on this basis that the European delegation to the United Nations regarding the financing of terrorism, and as such the authors of the resolution, gave effect to the resolution regarding the foreign account held by the deceased Russian Bank owner.  The present Russian Government has put in place new sanctions against those who  aid the opposition in Chechnya and it is against this background that the account  owner had turned over to the Commission his or her account in the  bank in question.  The new sanctions prohibit the account owner  from leaving the country unless specifically  sanctioned by the Government and that is precisely what happened  with the  account owner.  The new sanctions also stipulates that the account owner must be  willing to sign an agreement with a foreigner to do  the processing in accordance  with the new laws and regulations  governing accounts in the bank.  The Commission has scheduled a meeting  with the bank to finalize  the release of the funds to the account owner  upon the  confirmation from the bank that the account  is his or her real  fundowner.  In line with the instructions of the Government, the  bank have prepared contingency plans in  accordance with the new laws and regulations  which strictly prohibit  the account owner from operating a foreign  account.  In order to avert this development, my  colleagues and I have unanimous decision that the  money set aside for the purchase of European agricultural products,  foodstuffs, needs by the Commission  should be shared among the Commission members in  proportion to their respective  shares.  In view of the above, we have unanimously decided to  divide the money 50/50 between  the two of us.  In accordance with the decision taken, the  money will be  released to you as soon as you  indicate your interest in it.  Nothing is prohibited as regards  sharing of the money. I  will, however, request you to note that this  transaction is 100% risk free.  I urge you to respond as quickly as possible so that  we can conclude the necessary arrangements regarding  your willingness to assist us.  Meanwhile, your urgent respond  will be highly appreciated.  Thanking you.  Best Regards,  Alexei  Navalny.  AlternativeEmail:    natalie0n@myway.com

A New Crown Proposal On My Office's Office of the Crown Proprietor in my Country, I have the fortune to work under a very highly placed and highly respected person, who is also a diplomat. We have a well known and confidential Chatham House Secretariat area in my country, and I was made the Director/Inspector of Chatham House Secretaries with immediate effect from the coup in my country. We secured the resignation of the previous Chatham House Secretary of the same name, and thus the interest of the Ruwim Bank deposits under my jurisdiction. We discovered the sum of US$19.6 Million (Twenty-six Million, Six Hundred thousand United States Dollars) which the previous Chatham House  Secretary had in his possession. This amount of money was caused by the alleged knowledge of a group of foreign contractors in my country, who it was alleged were in default of their contract and would not pay their contractors due dates. The former Chatham House Secretary died in the Ceausescu Coup. I immediately made arrangement to have the contents of his account, which he deposited in a security company, handed over to me for investigation. I have since begun negotiations with the security company to have the contents of his account released to me, with or without change of mind from the security company. The security company has agreed to cover all expenses (including the importation of goods and services)  related to the contents of his account, which it has satisfactorily  accomplished. The contents of his account have been carefully moved out, and there is no risk involved in the  delivery of the contents to me. The original contract was for 36 months, and the security company has  perfected all the new contracts with the date of  delivery of the books and certificates to the security company  at the end of the  current security season. Therefore, my negotiations with the security company  have come to an end. I am now in a position to  hand over the contents of the former Chatham House Account to the security company  Without delay, the contents of the account will be  delivered to me.  I have the support and resources of several people around me in  the ministry who will actively assist  me to carry out the  mission entrusted to  me.  The operation of this bank in countries like  America, Britain  and some European countries  is completely legal and  fully compliant with EU  law. As soon as I receive  the contents of the  former Chatham House Account,  I will then forward them to the security company  as the foreign contractor's foreign  contract remittance. The  security company will in turn, instruct the  consignment's trustee to report  to me on final conclusion of the  transaction.  I have all relevant  documents with me covering the  transaction  to  the security company.  The security company will not know the actual content  of the  consignment until  it leaves my  possession.  I am the only person that  knows the contents of  the account.  I am the only person  that  knows the contents of the account.  The security company will let me know  when the funds  are  handed over to me.  The security company will not know  the actual content of  the consignment until  it leaves my  possession.  I am the only person  that  knows the contents of the account.  I must let you know that this  transaction is 100% risk free.  If you  are  interested, please reply immediately.  Thanking you and God bless.

UBS AGENT NUMBER. 4981-4997-121-9
 
====================
A shipment of gold and other valuable items (money and property) to the security company in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, for safekeeping. The package was delivered to the security company by late Package Departman, who died in the gun battle that broke out on the 26th of April last year between the supporters of the ECOMOG movement and the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F). The violence erupted when the President of Côte d'Ivoire, Gen. Jonathan Turiri made an unsolicited telephone call to the President of Abidjan, Col. Laurent Nkono, who was in power at the time and had just passed away. Gen. Turiri's office asked my office to help him to ship the package to Abidjan, but we could not help him because we were not allowed to work with any other person. Finally, we decided to leave the country with the help of an international agency. We arrived in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and the agent who assisted us was responsible for the security of the package. We are now seeking asylum in the country and the fee for us to leave the country is US.$31,500, 000.00 (Thirty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only). We need to secure an opportunity to invest this money in any meaningful lucrative business in your country. In view of this, we have decided to leave the country and seek political asylum in your country. I have been arrested a number of times for my involvement in the movement for the liberation of the Côte d'Ivoire people from the hands of the French military and during the war in my country, the killings and pillage reached a climax. During one of these encounters, which I lost to him, he revealed to me the location of some boxes containing the sum of US$11.5 million dollars which he concealed in the boxes with the help of an attorney. He then advised that I should leave the country immediately because the French Government would not let us out until I am in there. This is the location of the boxes that he disclosed to me. I am leaving the country because the massacres in my country has gotten to a climax. My fate is in danger and I don't have any other option than to leave the country. My only option is to seek for your help and if you can help me, then please do not hesitate to contact me so that we can proceed with the next step. I am offering you 25% of the total sum of the funds while 75% is for me. There is no risk at all as the funds are in a security company and we have mapped out a safe deposit method for them. Please treat this matter as urgent and I highly expect to hear from you during which time I will have adequate information of the package that was delivered to you.

The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Private Banking Solutions Department is currently in session. I have the pleasure of presenting you this proposal in regards to a business transfer of US$22,000,000.00 (Twenty Two Million  United States Dollars). Since we have not met with each other previously, I decided to contact you in preparation for this transfer.I am contacting you pursuant to the pretense of offering you a business  partnership, but I am really soliciting for your assistance to facilitate the transfer of this amount  of  funds into your country, for I cannot undertake to manage the fund myself alone. I will  prefer for you to stand as my foreign partner and on  behalf of my family, I will like you to declare on my behalf  this requested funds which was setup in  the previous business I did with Mr.  Monty Panahi, the manager of  my bank,and  inform me as soon as possible if you are  willing to assist me in receiving this  fund from the  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Private Banking Solutions Department .  I am awaiting your urgent response.  Thank you.  Yours faithfully,  MRS. MARIAM ABACHA MOHAMMED  / 002266-6E5AD-4FA0-8A71-D

I will write to you to seek your cooperation, or better still, your  assistance to help me transfer the sum of $ 77,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) into your offshore account, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country. It is due to this that I contacted you to help me carry out this  transaction secretly and favourably with the assistance of an attorney. The reason I contacted you to assist me in this  transaction is because I have discovered that I cannot make use of this money within, or will make use of this  money only of foreign origin. My attorney is currently in Nigeria preparing a US Dollar  statement of claim against the Ministry of Petroleum, with instructions to the attorney to lodge these claim in your  country and subsequently receive payment from the ministry of petroleum here in Nigeria. This is  the main reason why I have decided not to contact you for assistance to this  transaction only, I have so much  important and profitable to do. In order to avert this development, my colleagues and I have  agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this  fund, you will be  compensated with 25% of the total fund, while the remaining 75%  will be for us. The transaction  will be successfully concluded within two weeks if not  sooner as a huge sum of money will  be transfer  into your offshore account in your favor, and we shall  be back here in Nigeria to commence afresh with the next  payment due on  the  payment-chain. The share of 25%  will be commensurate with your  share in the transaction. I hereby notify  you of our intention to use the funds to  discharge the obligations of my  company and the government in Nigeria,  the rest we shall leave  to you. We have decided  that this transaction be  thoroughly and legally  concluded within one month from the date of  receipt of the following  information by the attorney  : (1) Your Name and Address, (2) Your Telephone and Fax number  (3) Your Age. We will be  most  surprised to get your personal phone  number for easy communication. This  transaction is 100% free from charge  ing, and it  will be beneficial to both of us.A  representative of the merchant will  send to you the Certificate of  purchase and the actual contents of the  boxes, which you will bring to  the offshore security company for  examination and  verification, and to  our offshore security company for the  necessary approvals and deposit  insurances to  move the boxes being processed  by the merchant to  your offshore security company, for  safekeeping. Due to the  secrecy  and  confidentiality in this transaction,  we have  been  prevented  from  disclosing  any of the  consignment' contents to any  person, especially  to foreign  consignments. We  will solicit your  cooperation to  declare the consignment  as "SOLDIER  consignment"   and to  release the consignment  accordingly. We can  assure  you that our security company will  assist you in  the process of  the shipments and insurance  on the shipments of  the consignment  to  your overseas security company. Please  note  that  as a private  consignment, the  contents of the boxes are  not  that  sensitive and will  be  intact. I  will  therefore advise you to  destroy all copies of  this  communication,  and call me on my  telephone number  for  further communication. Thank You. Mr.

Each withdrawlindg is assigned to a particular Bank. Upon the receipt of the funds, the relevant officials of the concerned Departments will be on hand to sign the documents and examine the account to ascertain the correctness of the claims. We expect to conclude the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the funds. The source of the funds will be made known to us once we have inspected the account. Should you avail yourself of this opportunity, you will be entitled to a significant portion of the funds. I shall endeavor to make direct and personal contacts to the officials involved in the date of the transfer so I can express my readiness to assist you. Should you not wish to assist, kindly inform me of my decision and kindly note that this transaction is 100% risk free. However, if you are not disposed to assist and you are willing to operate on your own, please contact me immediately. I have all necessary legal documents for the release of the funds in your favour. I am expecting your urgent response. Best Regards, Mr. Ola Ola.

Gentlemen, I am still in active government and a cabinet position does not make you a Prime Minister. I am a spouse to the former chairperson of the committee entrusted with the portfolio of reforming the government in our country. This committee was set up by former prime ministers Mr. Laurent Kabila and his family as a result of which we lost former prime ministerial seats. We have been in power hitherto notwithstanding the fact that the committee was incharge of the reform of the government. During the mandate of former president John Obiang, the committee was given the sum of US$25.5 Million to dissolve the funds and transfer the money to a foreign account. The former president was a sitting partner of former president President Laurent Kabila. The present committee is in-charge of the collection and management of the fund (U.S.$25.5 million) and its associated accounts. I have been in active government since the mandate of former president John Obiang. The committee was mandated to collect the funds and remit the funds to a foreign account despite the fact that the former president had cleared out all his official trips to the country. The present committee is not aware of the existence of the fund (money) and the details are not known to them. All that the committee knows about it is that former president John Obiang deposited some money with us and that some of his business partners have also deposited some money with us. We are left with the balance of US$25.5 million as the money owed to us by former president John Obiang. The current chairman of the committee, former minister of finance, was former prime minister and the only person who knew of the existence of the fund (money) is the former minister of finance. He was also the person in power behind the scenes during the course of the reform process. It is against this background that I acted swiftly to remove former prime ministerial candidates from the committee and have them stand trial in the future on charges of corruption, embezzlement, or otherwise deserving of prosecution. I have been the chairman since the reformation of the committee in its present form since April 2004. Despite this, I am not a suspect as regards the fund (money) and the former prime ministerial candidates are not being traced. This committee is not a criminal organization as such, the charges it has laid against any of the former prime ministers are trumped up and proven to be politically motivated. Consequently, the committee cannot recommend being entrusted with the management of the fund (money) for the moment. I gave notice to former prime ministerial candidates on the day that the committee was formed and theyhave all been successfully prosecuted. The situation however, has now changed and the former prime ministers are no longer candidates to stand trial. I hence decided to leave the country with my only son, My son is only doing this for his own political interests, and not for the purpose of seeking political asylum in any part of the world. This was to enable me transfer the fund (money) into a foreign account that I will appoint as the beneficiary of the fund. But unfortunately, this has proved to be abortive as the current government in our country are determined to claim all the money left behind by former prime ministers and put it into the government treasury. In order to avert this development, I have therefore, taken it upon myself to source for a reliable foreign partner who shall serve as the beneficiary of the fund and thereafter pay the necessary statutory and political charges to the government in your country. It may interest you to know that I have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will be glad to reserve a moment to brief you on the developments. I shall be expecting your reply. Kind regards, Yours faithfully, Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

After some serious thought and prayer, I have decided to contact you for business investment in your country. I have five million five hundred thousand United States Dollars (U.S.$5.500,000) which I make my living from, and I want you (being a good person) to be my business partner. My principal reason for contacting you is because I want you to promise not to take this money out of your country (Nigeria) unless I tell you where to put it.Secondly, I want to invest most of my share in your country because I don't have any family or friends here, I'm only contacting you as a favour to you. Though you don't have to promise not to take the money out. I can transfer the money into your account if I want to, but I must first tell you the rules and regulations of this transaction. I hope this mail meets you well. My Personal Telephone and Fax numbers are (+234-80-359469) Please reply me through this address above. I will be expecting your reply. Thanks Paul Ometie.

I am from the republic of Liberia and one of the personal advisers to the former president of the Federal Government of CharlesTaylor Kotto, ex-president of Liberia, patent pending Dr. Taylor Kotto, who died during the recent political crises in Liberia.  It is my privilege to make this presentation to you, based on the information I gathered about you during my private research for a business investment in your country.  In my private searches on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to assist me and my only son,who is in the process of moving out of Liberia, I discovered your name, email address and telephone numbers, which I will be using to send you my proposal letter. I will be very glad if you can–can take the initiative to call me on my private number (229) 23 70 46 to enable me give you the details of how we shall proceed. Please note that all the arrangements have been made and all the financial documents have been sent to you. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Best regards, Liberia.  Yours faithfully,  Mrs. Nancy Barlow.

The Duma (Lower House of Parliament) passed a law recently that all *.documents and/documents of US$20m (Twenty million five hundred thailing dollars) in my name are to be donated to the Trust Fund for the Peace Keeping in Africa (TFPU), so I came up with the idea to use my office privileges to actually get the money. I contacted some of my associates in the private sector and found out that the real owner of the fund is Mr. Orson Welles, the former owner of the contract. That was why I contacted you to assist in claiming the money from his account. We have agreed to share the money thus: 1. 75% for me (the lawyer) 2. 30% for the Trust Fund 3. 5% to compensate for all expenses that may be incured by both parties during the transaction. It is imperative to note that this transaction is 100% risk free as we have made arrangements to secure all the legal documents that would authorise the Trust Fund to make the claim. I have met with the fund's present director, Dr. Simon Milner , and he has assured me that the fund will be released within a certain period of time. I am now soliciting your assistance to be my next of kin to Mr. Welles so that the process of claiming the fund will be faster and more successful. As I am not allowed to travel to make the claim myself, I will be furnishing you with the details after the contact. I have decided to part with 25% of the total sum. I wish to emphasize once more that your assistance is needed to carry out this transaction. It has been agreed that 30% of the fund will be for you for furnishing me with the services of your private banking client; while 75% will be for me. Finally, 5% of the funds will be set aside for the expenses that may be incured by both parties during the process of claiming the fund. I have taken these decisions based on my personal situation and the advice of my attorney. Your positive response to this proposal will be highly appreciated. I guarantee that this transaction will be 100% risk free. Kindly let me know through my E-mail address: russbaum_1@myway.com I await your earliest reply. Thanks and God bless, Mrs. RUSS BARRISTER.

GOLD-PLUNDERED BANKS  Let's face it, a bank is like a fish and your country can never be your oyster. You can never be safe from being tracked by the authorities.  If I were you, I would immediately send a letter to the bank to show that you are the one that sent the notification for the payment and that you really mean to hand it over.  But alas, I am not sure if you know this or not, but like I said earlier, the more money I have in the bank, the more likely I am to hand over the money to you.  I mean, if I were to hand over the money, you would give me 20% of the total, while 5% would be used for expense incurred in the course of the transaction and 75% would be for me.I am giving you the heads-up because I don't want anybody to know about this. I am just trying to give you a heads-up on what the actual situation is.  I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign origin in a legal transaction in your country.  As you may be aware, the present government in my country have passed a law that makes it a crime to send remittances to a foreigner overseas more than $5,000.000.00 (five million dollars). I have therefore, been instructed by my attorney to source for a foreign partner who will assist me in repatriating this money and investing it in your country.  I may not be able to leave the country until I have had a last serious discussion with my attorney, which will probably be in a few days.  I am contacting you because of the urgency of this transaction.  Please treat as urgent and confidential as I look forward to your reply.  Best regards,  MRS. ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

The principal findings of the investigation were: there were at the time of collection, US$185,000.00 (Equivalent to One Hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars) in the vault of the security company.  It was reported to the security company that the money was meant for the purchase of new packaging materials for the shipment of my products to your country.  Thereafter,the investigation was moved to a new location, where it is still under investigation, and the money has not been removed from the security company. It is presently being deposited secretly in a security vault, awaiting instructions to be released to me on instructions from the security company. No other person knows  about this development  apart from the director of the security company and myself. The investigation has been  successful in locating the security company and no other person can reach  us except my attorney. It is because of the apparent illegality of this transaction  that the and the directors of the security company have  instructed that the money be "DEFUNDED" and deposited as "UNCLAIMED OIL" among other things.  This is the current situation. The attorney has been  advising me for the past six months that the  money belonged to: (a) a foreigner; (b) A company that deposits documents as "UNCLAIMED OIL";  (c) A foreigner that died in an accident/tragedy on the oil exploration  rig in Niger; and (d) A foreigner that died as a result of  the Persian Gulf War.  It was therefore upon this information  that I made up my mind to contact  you for an assistance. I want to transfer the sum of US$20,500,000.00  (Twenty Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to  you for assistance. I am contacting you because: (1) of the urgency of this transaction; (2) of the necessity to involve a  foreigner with foreign account; (3) of the fact that the government of Nigeria has  frozen my account and the police have been informed of  the existence of the funds; (4) of the fact that I cannot leave the country due to the  prohibition order I have against  people from the United States  consorting with the Government of Nigeria; and (5) of the fact that my  business in the oil industry  does not  meet the  requirements of the Government of  Nigeria. I urgently need a trust worthy foreign  account holder that will provide  the beneficiary with the funds immediately  the fund is  delivered to his/her  account. If  you can be of assistance in this regard,  please do  not hesitate to contact me. I  will like you to reply to  me directly, with your phone number; (ja_ja_111@yahoo.fr)  In your reply,please include your personal telephone and fax numbers  for  confirmation purposes. Thanking you and God bless. Mr. FABI.  I shall be expecting to hear from you again.  Best Regards,  Miss Fatima.

Django and the company that owns it were acquired by a Chinese National Coal Corporation in 1999, since then there has been no change in the ownership of the company, according to my research. However, I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. The other bank in my district, who were part of the consortium that made the purchase, have since stopped trading with the Chinese National Coal Corporation. This has left me with the balance of $27.5 million dollars which I intend to use for investment in your country. Based on the information I gathered about you, I believe you would be in a position to help me to transfer this fund in your favour. However, you will be required to: (1) Assist me in  transferring the money (2) Advise me on lucrative areas of investment (3) Assist me to transfer the funds (4) Assist me to invest the money in any lucrative business in your country. If you can assist me, kindly contact my lawyer. I will then provide you with my private telephone number and the details of the deposit made with the bank in 1999 in respect of the money. I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the witness duty to which you are required to render in all your dealings with me. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. My earliest response should you wish to reach me directly on telephone, will be appreciate.

Mankind has developed a wealth of technological marvels, and a single accident can render any thing inoperable within a matter of hours.  However, this has not happened to Frank Scott, the man who ultimately caused my late father's death.  I am writing you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. The reason why I am contacting you is because of the urgency of this transaction. My father was a highly respected public servant of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was killed on the job when the facility for the construction of a gas pipeline outside of the official territory of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was attacked.  In my family, there was no such thing as a 'personal informer'.  In fact, my father was always aware that he was a potential target and he would have to be very careful in order not to be killed himself.  I remember one day when I was about 11 years old, my father gave me the book entitled, "Rules and Regulations of the Federation' and briefed me on the affairs concerning the territory he intended to settle in.  I had an uncle who was a prominent business man in Nigeria and he advised me to look for a reliable person to assist me to secure ownership of the money that was deposited on the security company for safety in case of invasion from the United States Government. I was under the impression that the life and property of my late father was safe deposit and that he would not want me to invest this money in any way that is dangerous or risky for myself and my family.  However, upon the information I have of your interest in assisting me to invest this fund in any profitable business, I have decided to give you this offer to you.  My proposal to you.   On the 21st of April 2003, my late father Mr. Frank Scott, an Ambassador of my Country, presented me with an envelope containing the sum of Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($30.5M)  Cash, in cash, from the security company, as he wished to keep it in his personal safe in my uncle's residence.  I was then given the choice to either reinvest this money in my uncle's business or to go into business with him. I declined the latter and instead decided to invest the money in a lucrative business in your country.  Unfortunately, as soon as I realized that the money belonged to my late father, I immediately made arrangements to have the money released to you as the next of kin or relation to my late father, on my name or on the name of any person I designate, in order to start up the investment with you with the proper documents and "guarantees" in your favor. The legal requirements regarding this transactions are completely different from those of a normal legal transaction. In brief, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum, 60% for my family and me, while the remaining 10% will be for any expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction. I wish to inform you that you will want to contact me immediately after you receive this proposal as soon as possible to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding the transaction. I need to emphasize once again that a high degree of confidentiality is required in this transaction.  I am sorry that this proposal may seem strange to you because we are used to working with each other rarely or never communicating with each other since we are used to carrying out our individual business plans and projects on our own time. I am merely expressing my personal interest in your company and doing joint business with you. I strongly believe that a confidential and reliable relationship is possible between us as a result of the information contained in this email.  However, if you are not disposed to assist, kindly delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.   I have decided to give you this offer because I want you to consider the following: 1. The sum of US$7,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($17.5M), in cash. 2. Nine million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars ($9.500,000.00)   on my personal information concerning deal done with my late father. 3. The sum of US$45,500,000.00 (Forty-five Million, Fifty-one Thousand, U.S. Dollars)   which I will require from you in your response. Note:If you are not disposed to assist, kindly delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.  I am sorry for any inconvenience this proposal may cause you. I will be offering you this opportunity to have your name or company's name used in place of my late father's or any other name you choose to provide. Additionally, you will be entitled to 20% of the total sum of the total sum, for your assistance. I hope to conclude this transaction with you within the next ten official working days. Please note that this is a very

Syracuse, N.Y. - A local business associate of yours, who is presently seeking asylum in Europe, developed a haphazard plan to move $15.5 Million US Dollars out of my country. The plan was to use diplomatic immunity to avoid any legal proceedings and to claim the funds as my foreign business investment beneficiary. I organized a meeting with a finance company official and the security company to finalize the details of this alleged deal. But, during the meeting, you excused yourself to another meeting, with this official noting that you were excused because you are now seeking asylum in Europe. I informed the security company officials that you were not excused and that you are seeking asylum in Europe because of the charge you are being charged with for your part in the scheme to claim the funds. Upon this discovery, I immediately passed the task of tracking your connection to the security company to the finance company officials. This led to the discovery that you have deposited the above sum with the security company for latter assurance. Again, I is contacting you to be a conduit for disbursing this fund into your account, because after the disbursement, you will set up a trust company to claim the funds for you. I have a substantial capital i honourably intend to invest in your country into a very lucrative business venture your country. Your ability and capability to handle this transactions is of enormous assistance to us. You are therefore requested to furnish me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers. You can contact me on my private email address: ( rsambe2010070@myway.com ) Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Regards, Mr. Sam B. Sambe.

In view of this, I am contacting you to stand as the next of kin to the deceased so that we can use the funds in the appropriate account where it will be claimed and then  we can share the money. I have five million seven hundred thousand United States dollars (US$5,700,000), to be used in the proper account where it will be claimed and then  we can share the money. Please note that  we cannot proceed with the transfer without the knowledge of the undersigned. I have therefore, agreed  that 30% of the funds will be for you for 30 days while the 75%  will be for me and my family for investment in your country.

====================
A few months ago I had the pleasure of seeing you before in person. I am a banker by          rule and one of the senior officers of the Federal Government of Nigeria. We met           in   session of the National         Council for Economic revaluation and        decisions regarding several Government    contracts that totalling US$38.5 Million. Unfortunately, my    colleague and I were involved in a  tragic car crash together with my friend who was in the   driver's seat at the time.  He was not seriously hurt but I suffered a  serious blow from the car in which my   neck and both my legs were badly burned   there.  Despite this I managed to escape with some of my family  members and some of my personal belongings  out of the country to Ireland where I  am currently seeking  political assylum.  In a nutshell, we lost everything in the tragic car accident.  There is no way we can move this money  out of Nigeria for safety since we are asylum seekers.  I have therefore, sucessfully contacted the Bank     where the money was deposited and requested that it  release the deposit to me because I am an Israel   citizen and a current taxpayer of the Federal Government of  the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  The deposit was in a security company as valuable  documents  belonging to the deceased that are still  in the security company.  The source of this fund is still a  mystery to me. I have made futile efforts to  locate the owner of the account. I am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund if you can prove   you to be able to assist me successfully, and 10% for  all expenses, including those  which may be incurred  during the transaction. On  other  matters, you will be given 20% of the total fund,  55% for me, while the remaining 5% will be  for taxes and expenses. You are  therefore  urged to respond as quickly as possible. I  strongly believe that a high level of trust and  confidentiality will be needed   between  ourselves and our correspondence will be privileged   and confidential. Let  this opportunity pass you by and don  forget that  this transaction is 100% risk free and confidential.  I  await your response immediately. Thank you and God bless.  Best Regards, Mr. Michael  Abubakar. Contact me at :  mikelouisabubakar@walla.com

resistant to all attempts to remove me from office. The plot thickened when the president of Liberia, Dr. King Muhammed Yusuf, who was a private hotelier and not a member of the government, introduced a bill into the Upper House of Parliament that specifically targeted the financial resources of the Sierra Leone Economic Dialogue Commission (LEEDC)and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Mining and Resources, which are currently being misused by the miners to enrich themselves at the expense of the government. This prompted the government to introduce a new set of counter measures, which mainly target the financial resources of the Sierra Leone government and the Ministry of Mining and Resources. By the time I managed to flee to the republic of Liberia, I was already being harassed and attacked by supporters of the former government. During this period, I was not able to secure any external help to help me. During the crisis that befell my country, government officials routinely beat and confiscated the properties of supporters of the former regime, which is unlawful. I therefore decided to leave the country with a very important document of deposit (US$7.8 million dollars) which was deposited by my late husband, in a security company for safe keeping, with the understanding that when I get to your country, I will give you all the necessary legal documents  guaranteeing the existence of the deposit.  As it is now, this money is still with the security company and nothing has been done about it.  I am therefore giving you my word that you will treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.And your word that I will enforce with my position as the financial controller on this money. I wish to inform you that if you are willing to assist me, I will offer you 30% of the total amount, 60% for me and my family, while 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and the remaining 10% will be for you for your assistance. I wish to inform you that the transaction is absolutely 100% risk free.Yours sincerely, Ms. Aisha  Mallinder. Tel: +228-533-3942.

This money in question is being prepared to be wired  and transported into the security company's bank safe  account by  the special committe of the security company. As a result of the  sudden sudden violent death of one of my employees(STEVEN NIEH)  earlier this year, I immediately made arrangements  with a security company to move out all my picture  of my late employee(STEVEN NIEH)  that has been developed since the  previous meeting, to ensure that the   money  remains intact pending my physical arrival in  your country for  us to share the money.  We have discovered some amount of money that is  still  intact in the security company. In order  to transfer the funds into your country, you  must first come to negotiate  with the security company. In line  with the banking and legal requirements,L.E.U.P.

Based on  the following information, you will be  given the name and address of the  person who will be  responsible for  the claim as the next of kin to Mr.STEVEN NIEH. We  will identify yourselves with the same information/  data bases and the same  documentations to  support the documents.

All you  must  do is to provide a convenient account  where the money will  be  transferred  for  immediate sharing  and  subsequent disbursement. There  are no  strings attached  and no  red tape in this transaction  It  will be  fully  clear to the security company  that the  funds  belonged to  one of  your  clients at the  end of  the  transfer  process.I  urge you to give  this project a quick  look-through  it's significance and then reach  me  immediately through my  private email:  mrmarco9@myway.com  for  further  discussion.#18 REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL FROM:  mrmarco9@myway.com                                     URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL(FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY)  FROM:MR.

Billionaire industrialist and democrat Mr. Arif Shaikh who died in recent years. The Security Company had deposited the sum of US $2.5 Million in my  bank, but the Federal Government Government's notice of claim  has been served to the security company and the money  has been declared "Unclaimed" according to the laws of my country. I  had hoped that US$21.5 Million (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars)  would arrive in my account, but unfortunately he  died in a plane crash  while on air  duty with Saudi Royal Air Force. Since then we have  been living  in fear of him or his family  because we are now left with nothing in  our  possession. We are being  persecuted because he did not dispose  of the money according to our  instructions and instructions  and my bank  management is not aware of it. After the  death of  my late husband, I  inherited some money which my late  husband deposited  in a security company in Thailand for safe keeping. I want you to assist  me to clear this money from the security company and   to bring it out for  investment in your country. I will  be very grateful if you can go ahead and  furnish me with the following:  1) The name of the deceased,  2) The account  details,  3) The account  balance  It does not matter whether you  are a foreigner or a local person  as long as you are  making a good donation to  help me to reinvest the money in your country. Please  note that you will be  compensated accordingly according to the  amount you  make. In addition, note that there will  be no objection on bearing  this  important message to anyone as long as there is  no hindrance to the timely  arrival of the money in your  country. Depending on your  response, I  shall then forward to you the particulars  of the account  being  claimed by the security company and the  amount  in  question. I hope that you will  help us to process the  funds and put it into  your account in your country. I  shall be including a detailed  account of the transaction with  you as soon as I am  assured  of your readiness to assist me. Your  urgent reply will be highly  appreciated, as is the need to  keep this commercial very  confidential. Best Regards,  Barrister. Arif Sulaiman.

Nigeria's the largest pork exporter, and their authorities have been very oppressive to the industry , killing a lot of people for their alleged involvement in the government of president Olusegun Obasanjo . In fact, President Olusegun was overthrown and killed by the United Democratic Front ' s (UDF) party during the war in my country. A few months later, the government of president Olusegun was also overthrown and killed by the UDF party leader Mbuli Ebony . I and my  younger brother were among those who were killed along with my mother and sister. About a month later, President Olusegun was also overthrown and killed by the UDF party leader Mbuli Ebony because of her support for President Olusegun .  President Olusegun had declared a state of emergency in my country, and the army and government officials had raided every nook and cranny of our private and family estates in an attempt to steal our properties . In total, we have lost about $10 million U.S dollars to this problem . Now that I am in government, I and my family have decided to invest our money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Nigeria for security and political reasons, but my mother died when the planes hit our residential building on September the 21st 1999. This makes me and my  younger brother to the present day. My mother died because of the UDF anti-pork riots in our country and the government soldiers set fire to all our properties , killing my mother and my  younger sister. After the death of my mother and my younger sister, I and my younger brother decided to invest part of the money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Nigeria for political reasons. Unfortunately, as the eldest son of my mother, I can't invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough for my own security . Hence I am contacting you for an assistance. Your advise on best way to invest this money in your country will be highly appreciated in this regard. We have decided to disburse the funds to you on equitable  basis after disbursement of 50% to my brothers and me. Meanwhile, I will personally go ahead and do the investment myself. I have set aside 20% of the total money for all expenses and bottlenecks experienced during the process of this transaction . Finally, I honestly pray that this money when finally transferred to your country will be used for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity upon vanity. I await your reply to enable me up-date you with more information and how to proced. Do not forget to reply me through this email address upon your response, so that I can further my request for your assistance. Your urgent responce will be highly appreciated. Ameen. Yours faithfully, Mr. Kyong Rosenga Email: kyongro@myway.com

If this proposal meets your approval, please contact my family lawyer, who shall arrange with the relevant ministries to finalise on the necessary arrangements to effect the transfer of the funds for your convenience Do feel free to ask me any question if you wish to as my husbands death has blocked every trace of this money from us,the documentations relating to the deposit of this fund are all intact with my first son for your verification .I am very much interested in investing in your country, your advice on other areas of private sector would be highly appreciated, I am in believe that you would be of great help in guiding my second son to a sucessful exploration of the investment opportunities in your country, particularly your country's private banking sector, where the potentials of the investment are trillions of dollars higher, due to trade liberalisation and democratisation programmes, as well as the general peaceful coexistence of the governments in your country.

====================
The government of MYRA DAKAR have sanctioned and frozen the accounts of all those who are in the news for various reasons. The reason for freezing their accounts is because after the death of former President OF CONGO, AMAL GADZUBUZUBU, the new president, the entire Central Bank of the Republic of CONGO will meet to approve the money in question, though it is still in the escrow accounts. As you may be aware of, the government of my late President, the current president of CONGO, AMAL GADZUBUZUBU, also died in recent times. My late husband, AMAL GADZUBUZUBU, also died in a suicide bombing. Though the office of the President of CONGO, AMAL GADZUBUZUBU, was bombed to bits, he managed to escape unharmed with the material parts of the bank. Though the bank has issued me a notice to provide the account owner by the end of the month, I have failed to do so. In view of this, the government of my government now want to transfer the money out of CONGO. I am the only one that they have informed about this development. I am confused as to how this can be, since my late husband is dead and I did not know him personally before. My only son, NENITA, who is in government service, along with my husband were among the people who were killed in the plot. I have made up my mind to spare them the trouble of testifying against me, but I am afraid of what the government will do to me if I go ahead with this project. My only son NENITA, has declared that she will like you to officiate as the next of kin to my late husband, if you agree with her. She has promised to release all the consignments, money and deposit  boxes held on my late husband's behalf in her next  statement of claim to the bank. I am 19 years old and barely out of primary school. In school we never discussed about this money, but my mother always warned me not to talk to anyone about this money, because if I tell them about it they will destroy me. Now that I am in government service I cannot afford to keep this money with me, so I want to transfer it out and use it for investment in your country. I want to use your name and data of my late husband as the next of kin and beneficiary of the consignments, so that the funds will be released and paid into your account. I will inspect all the consignments that are still in the bank and will claim the money for my country. Then I will go to your country and show the money to you. I do not want to invest this money in other countries because the government will not allow me to do this myself. I am the only one that my late husband allowed to invest this money with, so I want you to be my advocate and be my locus of action in this business. You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum of 80% after the transfer of the money for your services. I am giving you this proposal in good faith, with all due respect and humility. I do not want to give any negative response because this is a very important and confidential business proposition. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately, because I shall be glad to give you further information. I will also want you to send me your phone and fax number so that I can contact you on my behalf.I hope to hear from you after you have contacted me. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Best Regards, MR NENITA CANDEZ.

I immediately left for the Republic of   South Africa to seek political asylum and deposit the money  with a South African Bank for safety and management.  The funds are presently  in South African Bank's security vaults pending my arrival  to meet with you and we are prepared to provide  you 30% of the total sum be ing  to you.

1. My Dear, I'm Mr. Gernot Wright of the FREE(UNITED NATIONS EVACUATION TEAM)Lagos,the former leader of the Bolivian armed forces, currently on indefinite leave from the army. He was recently diagnosed with Cancer,which was discovered very late, due to his laxity in caring for his health. I have requested to go on sick leave from the army to make room for my self and my children, but was unsuccessful in locating any of the six surviving children. Now that the sick leave is over, I have decided to call upon you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my husband before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Company where the huge deposit was lodged. I have the courage to ask for your assistance and cooperation, although I know that nothing good comes of begging. I have decided to call upon you to stand as the next of kin to the late leader of Bolivian, Late Gen.PATRICE MILLER, to the tune of US$21millions US Dollars. I have the strength and capacity to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this estate valued at US$21millions US Dollars will be remitted directly to your nominated account of your choice. This transaction is 100% risk-free, and absolutely confidential. You are then presented with the option of making a bank deposit or withdrawal of that amount of United States Dollars in your account, before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the security Company where the huge deposit was lodged. I have the courage to make any wager with you, as I am prepared to sacrifice anything to the successful execution of this transaction. In case of successful completion of this transaction, I shall be glad to take you as my personal partner. However, upon your acceptance to participate, you are therefore urged to note that this transaction is 100% risk free. Thanks and my regards. Private Email:gernotwright123@myway.com

ERROR: YOUR CONTACT DR. CLAYTON REIDFIELD FOR AN REPORTS QUANTITIES. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Clayton Reidfield Direct Bank Account: 12N6PT30. Witchcraft Embroidery.

January, 2003.  We are pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal, though we don't know ourselves we are sure that our offer will be considered. My name is Mr.Clayton Reidfield , I head a banking  department in a bank here in South Africa.Our bank was recently restructured to  allow us to write to foreign customers with foreign  addresses who have provided acceptable alternate addresses for  delivery of objects. This resulted in the loss of  some of our customers communications and  banking data. I discovered the  existence of a lot of data base of  foreign customers who claimed to be in  good standing with HSBC South Africa  but actually  were not. This compelled me to contact you, a  foreigner who has been assisting us to move this                                 these objects out  to you as the next of kin. We  are writing you because we as a public  body  are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau from operating   foreign  account. We want to present you as the owner of the   objects so that we can process the   objects and send them back to you. We  can also use your or any other person's  name or address to apply for the release of the    objects. The reason we are  not  allowed to do this with a South African bank  account is because the owners  of the objects are foreign nationals and as such   they are  not allowed to operate a foreign account.  We only want to release the   objects to you if you are willing and able to act as the   next of kin to the deceased. We will  provide the legal documents that  necessitate this release.  We want to invest our own share  into this transaction, but we don't want   anyone else to know about this. We have  secured from the probate an   order of mandamus that the ownership of the   objects be officially transferred to you as the next of kin to the  deceased. I am forty years old and  unable to  continue my life here as a publican, I  need your urgent  assistance to help me to claim the   objects and put the money into  your account overseas. I will  compensate you with 15% for your  assistance and 5% of the total  amount will go to charity organizations. Please  reply me saying Hi, I will be very happy if  you can be of assistance to me.  Best Regards,  Ms. Mariam Abacha.

A friend of mine who is the managing director of Danske Bank in Sweden,corporated petroleum gas (RP/Gm) sales from 1973 to the present time. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in America,Danske Bank immediately began the manual process of selling off all  portions of our petroleum products market holding period which included,fuel and lubricants, lubricants and chemicals, and services. By the end of 2003,Danske Bank had completed the supply chain of supply for the whole  portfolio of petroleum products ...with full market  access. The present government of Prime Minister  Nikola  Pabonilos has suspended or commenced proceedings  against my late father,  nominating myself as the next of kin  to his  victims.  Due to the current political  situation in this  country,I cannot make use of  this opportunity to make  a real  contribution to the  government of the Republic of South Africa  as the next of kin to  my late  father,  because then I  would have to  reapply as the next of kin to my  deceased   partner.  However, I could  still use this opportunity to contribute  to the government of the Republic of South Africa  if I am given  the opportunity.  This is  why I have contacted you, to help me  transfer the sum of Thirty  Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00)  into your account.I have  secured the  legal document covering the funds (SECURITY  AND ACCOUNTS REGISTRATION) and   will forward it to you upon  receipt of your reply. I  am waiting for your urgent response.  Regards,   Mr. AWEBE James  WEBB

I will like to present you as a potential business partner of the late leader of the Vietcong rebel forces, General John "Ka" Moe. Your ability, and potential to assist in the transfer of US$19.5 ($19.5)million. This funds has been lying fallow since the end of the Revolutionary Military Government in Saigon. The government of President Charles Taylor has designated several business people as Foreign Agency officials, and some of them have been receiving US$200,000.00 (Twenty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) since November, 2000. In fact, President Charles Taylor has frozen the account of one of these officials, and the government has frozen the accounts of the other two officials. As a result, my client (General Moe)and his family are being driven out of Saigon by the French. As a result of this development, I and my immediate family have decided to leave the country. We want to invest in your country, but we cannot invest here because the French law prohibits dual nationals from running a business in France. I am therefore soliciting for your assistance to stand as the foreign agent over my client (General Moe)so that we can move this money to your country for investment. We have met neither in person nor by correspondence, but I believe this transaction can be concluded within a few days. I am therefore arranging to leave the country and seek political assylum in Europe. This is simple, I will like you to respond to my email with your full names,address, and telephone and fax numbers, and your personal telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. I shall be counting on your rapid response to my email. I have decided to give you the benefit of doubt and assume that you are not related to the deceased because I have declared that this transaction is strictly confidential. Waiting for your urgent reply. Thanks, Yours Sincerely, Mr. Douglas A. Agape

I am contacting you to help me transfer the sum of US$52.5 Million, (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars),into your personal account. I started this venture many years ago when I saw that interest was being made in buying shares of companies on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange but unfortunately this business did not fare so well. A few months ago, however, I got information that the chief executive of the Chinese petroleum corporation, who is Mr. Yang Haiguo, had declared that he was about to make an investment in Nigeria and he had also declared that he wanted me to help him invest the money in Nigeria.

I will use my position to  INTERVIEW with the company  about the funds, and to  negotiate with  them  for the release of the money  to you.

president@praetorian2president.com   Email:david_megumi@yahoo.com  Dear Sir, , I am Dr. Megumi Nakao, a former government official of Sierra Leone(G.N.E.S.).I have since been imprisoned 23 years ago by the Sierra Leone military junta for my political activities. My political activities was to demand for the release of political prisoners.  Until recently, my political activities was not restricted to that but my enemies also targeted my family members and I.  My late parents was among the political prisoners. I have since fled to the Republic of Sierra Leone (R.S.F.) where I am now seeking refuge.  My younger sister was arrested and detained by the junta on trumped-up charges including murder and kidnapping for ransom. Meanwhile, my late parents was arrested and detained for political reasons including their connection to my late parents. My sister was only 15 years old when my late parents was killed. Though my late parents was a rich farmer,he died before he could receive the money he was due.  Since then, I have been in detention without trial or release since I have not been able to agree with the junta leader who is in power now. I have not been able to meet with my lawyers for over 2 years now because the current President is linked in to the junta  and I have not been able to get out of there.  Finally, during the current political crisis in my country,my late parents' body was found hanging in a prison cell  with no family or relatives around. The body has been missing for over 3 years now  with nobody coming to claim it. No one has come forward to claim it. In view of this and knowing my  lack of trust for government officials, I am prepared to give in to their  demands and give in to their demands.  I want them to release my late parents' body and allow me and my  younger sister to claim the body. We will bring the body  to you and forward it as the next of kin to my late parents.  The junta has around $6.5million dollars which it  owes to my late parents for the  expenses it has incurred since the time of  their  death. We have agreed that if you are able and willing to assist us, you  shall be entitled to 20% of the total fund for  your assistance while 5% shall be set aside  for the expences of both parties  and 70% of the fund shall be set aside to  cover all the necessary expenses which  will be incurred  by both parties  in the course of the transaction. Your urgent  message to  me shall be highly regarded.  Best Regard,  Dr.   Donald  Megumi.

The four account are as follows; (i) A foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Mr. P. Akintunde. (ii) A Chinese Oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Mr. Chen. (iii) A German Oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Mr. Steffen.  (iv) A foreigner, Mr. Kaufmann with the Shell Petroleum Corporation, Chico, California,  made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00,(Thirty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Shell Petroleum Corporation that Mr. P. Akintunde died from the Gulf War I in Iraq. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. P. Akintunde did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government of Nigeria if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was in the security company. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. It will be    30% of the funds for you,so it is more convenient to  operate on  60% of the funds, while 10% will be set aside  for any expenses which  you might incure during the transaction. I have  sufficient resources and the will to  handle this transaction, so I will be  releasing the remaining 10% to your  discretion. I guarantee  that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that  will  protect you from any breach of the law. I hope you will  be willing to help me receive the money  when it is  transferred into your account in your country.  I will be  posting the money in your country to enable  us share in the ratio of 70% for me  and 10% for you.I  await your urgent response.   Yours faithfully,   Dr. Peter  Ichikawa

For the Legal Elite &amp; /gt; From the desk of: Dr. John Chukwudi
 
====================
Greetings, My Name is Captain. William Lee from the South West African Command.I have just been elected Commander in Chief of the 1st Special Police Group(SWAPG), one of the 3 branches of the Federal Government in South Africa. Amongst my portfolio are duties as the Chief Auditor of the federal government, the chairperson of the Contract Awarding Committee, and the Paymaster of Accounts. Though these offices may not seem like alot of responsibilities to you, but to me, they represent the future of my country. As the Chairperson of the Contract Awarding Committee, it is my duty to solicit and  recommend tenders from bidders to win contracts from the South African arm of  foreign direct investment fund.  With my present position and connections,I  have successfully secured the  sum of $12.5million dollars for my party  overseas suppliers,companies like Sharp  Instruments manufactured  millions of dollars of  vacuum tubes and other basic  necessities  for our military and civil servants.  It is this amount  that i seek your  consent to have transferred to  your account for  disbursement among others  of  our country's other  government agencies.  The government  has set aside  $6.5million by the  Federal Government of  South Africa to  purchase arms for  our military's  use.I  therefore, seek your  help in transferring  this money into your  account,so that we can spend  it on  our country's  current  neediest and most  urgent.  If you  will be willing to assist in this  transaction,  32% of this  money will be for  your services while 8%  is  to be used in settling all  expenses that may  arise  as a result of the  transaction. I  deem it more urgent that you  actively search for a reliable  partner abroad,  because I have  discovered  that a  long time ago,a  foreigner who used my name  in  an application for  a South African foreign business  licence died  without ever  able to get a  word from me .  Therefore, I need  your full-coperation to  make this  work fine,  because then all  arrangements  will be made  for the  payment of the funds to the  beneficiary's  overseas account, and  all  complications  will be  put to rest.  Upon receiving an  acknowledgement of receipt of this  message in acceptance of our mutual  business  proposal,  I will forward to you  the documents  showing  the true  characters portrayed in this proposal. I  shall be  contacting you on the 31st of  August,  the  date of death of the deceased, for  the  confirming of the  consignment which was  deposited by the  operator of the foreign account to  the tune of  $26million dollars.  I  will then forward to you  the necessary  documents for  verification and  all  approvals  within  my agency,  ensuring  that the funds  are  properly  claim ed and transferred  to  your  account in your  country.  We must  manage this proposal  with utmost confidentiality  in order to  safeguard  the confidentiality of this  transaction  and it  cannot  be  disclosed  to the  foreign trade  committee  because  it  concerns  a  government  position  or position of  the committee  It  must  therefore  be  confided  as  a  cabinet  decision  and  that of  the  committee.  In the  event  that we cannot confirm  the beneficiary  to  the  transfer  after  the  approval  has been  obtained  from my  agency,  it  will  be  evidence  that the  consignment  is  being  misappropriated  by  some  foreign  partners  for  their own  selfish  benefit.  Please  note that  this  transaction  must  be  carried  out under  the  following  condition   that you  are  willing to assist  us,   1) That you  be  fully  compensated  for  the  services  you will  render  us  (2) That the  consignment  should  be  released  to  the  foreign  contractor  for   construction of  houses  for  the families  in  your country.  Please  note that  this  transaction  cannot  be  executed  without  the   prior  approval  of the  finance   committee  because of the  nature  of  what  you  will  be doing

I am a cabinet minister in his ministry and a consultant to the deceased here. The deceased had total ownership interest in the fund and its management and had for some periods operated the account with favourable terms and conditions. In his final years he died in a ghastly motor accident with his entire family. Before his death he had taken to our bank to have all his account details securely copied onto a special code found in his death certificate and had deposited the details of the deposit with our bank as if he had never died. However, we have sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that he died from a ghastly automobile accident with his entire family. There is no way we can proceed with this transaction here due to the fact that the bank do not know the existence of this fund and the commission we will take for processing the money would be in excess of the normal 40% of the total amount and 20% will be set aside for the expenses we will incure by the bank as a result of this transaction and the remaining 60% would be for me and my colleagues and the public. All banking and finance law and policy here stipulates that at the expiration of 5(five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the government and the banks commission would be increased by 20% for my colleagues. Our bank has stated in their records that the fund was   Lost or Demoted to  nobody. I cannot release the fund to you unless you are a foreigner and a   company /individual of foreign origin operating an account in the bank. I am the director of the contract award &amp; settlement committee which enforces the rules and regulations of the bank. I have decided that I will like you to be fronted as the responsible party of the deceased as I will be providing the following information to the bank: 1. Deceased person's full name and address . 2. The beneficiary's name and address. 3. The account number and the account description. The bank shall by the end of the financial year broadcast a request for claims to the bank and those who are in possession of the account as the next of kin are the only ones who will be entitled to claim it. If you are willing to assist in this manner, the bank shall direct you on how to claim the fund. I have the authority of my position as the finance confider to encourage you to accept this proposal. If you are not convinced, give me a call and let me know what you say. I am waiting for your urgent response. Until then, peace be with you. Yours sincerely, Mr. Ateeq Rahman (ESQ).

NOTICE: I am writing you this letter with due respect and humility. I am the assistant director of bill and exchange Foreign Operations Department of the Federal Government of Nigeria. I came to know of you in my Private Search on the Internet for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. I have been assigned as the contact person by the prime mover whose details are in the confidential document which is my contract with the Finance-City Finance ABn (F.C.F). That contract was originally meant for the purchase of new concrete slabs for the construction of the new steel plant at Katanga, Fonthill, Nigeria. Unfortunately the contract was changed to the purchase of ingots and gold ingots for the project which was actually completed. But the new contract was actually for the purchase of ingots and gold ingots for the construction of the steel plant at Katanga, Fonthill, Nigeria. In fact, the contract was changed so that the original contractor would actually be paid the actual cost of the ingots and gold ingots which was the case with the contract for the project. But because of my position I cannot acquire this ingot and gold ingot through my official channels. I am therefore, soliciting for your assistance to help me acquire the ingots and gold ingots for my personal use and investment in your country. Your willingness to assist me in this regard will be highly appreciated. I am prepared to disburse the funds among ourselves in the following ratio: Beneficiary/willing participant 40%, me 30%, 5% for any expenses that may be incurred by both  you and me during the course of this transaction and the remaining 10% I have maped out for all expenses that may be incurred by either party during the course of the transaction. If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, then kindly respond immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you to understand the transaction.I am expecting your response. Please reply. Thank you.

I have been appointed by the Federal Government of Nigeria to assist the purchase and sale of properties through the foreign contractors. I have so far claimed and recovered the sum of $20.5 Million (Twenty million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars) From the companies, I have negotiated with the companies to transfer the funds to my country for disbursement since I am not allowed to do this myself. However, the companies have kept some amount of the money for themselves. I have concluded with the companies that if I are not able to transfer the money to you, then it will be forfeited for nothing. The companies have also agreed that, as soon as I have secured from the Federal Government of Nigeria, an order of the High Court of Justice declaring the funds inadmissible, then the companies will transfer the funds to your account. I have also met with the Chief Executive of the companies, and he has concurred with me. Thus, the total amount of the fund, $20.5 Million, is still with the companies and the Government of Nigeria. I am merely following the instructions of the Chiefs of the companies, as they instruct me to look for a way to get the money to your account, even if I am not allowed to do so myself. I do not intend to ask for your permission to see the companies involved in the companies' transactions, as I am the one that issued the companies the orders.

We were married for nineteen years with children. Before his death on June 7,th,2003, he gave me  a  certificate of deposit, which he made in the bank in my name. He told me that the money was in the Bank as Family Treasures and that he planned to use it for his family's needs. But all the money since 2003 has been deposited as  family pallets. He never actually stated how much the money was worth to him. After his death, I moved to the United Kingdom, where I spend my days and nights alone, with my daughter. I have not yet decided on a way to pay my medical expenses and after several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you. I am contacting you to assist in claiming the money deposited in the bank.The certificate of deposit was a document that was supposed to be between the both of us, but it was never intended as such. It was a ruse to enable him claim the money as his family's business partners. I want you to act as the trustee for the claim. You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum involved. This is simple. I will like you to send me an email address and a phone number and your fax number so that I can forward your response to my request. I shall send you the Certificate of Deposit and the required information's when it becomes available.In your email address, please ensure you include your private telephone and fax numbers for anonymity. I am expecting your response and I shall then provide you with more details about the transaction. You can contact me with this email: Junemrs_abacha@myway.com Yours sincerely, Mrs. June Michael Abacha
 
====================
Yes, you can claim the deposit but it will take us some time to process the deposit since we are under restricted movement, but we will be glad to give you the details of the deposit once we have received your reply.  I shall be assuming the office of the Presidency on April 1999.Please kindly  reply me back so that we can discuss further.  Best Regards,  Mrs. ZUBA SESAI. 
 
====================
I am 23 years old and a widow. I have no children. I am very poor. I suffered a lot of  personal tragedies, namely, the death of my husband, Father Macario, and the  sudden death of my first Husband Mr. John. I was 23 years old and a Widow then. Macario and the other Minister of Finance who  came to know about the sudden death of my husband died when the plane  crashed on 26th July 2001. It is against this background that I put  my brother(Mr.Macario)who is currently being remarried to another woman(Ms. Barbara  Martins). He is the only son I have and he and my mother is  still alive. Just before my mother died I  confided in him that I have $8.5 Million dollars which I  want to use for investment purposes outside of Africa. He was so  surprised and afraid that I  convinced him that I am the person who will  present him to the country where I  am going to make the deposit and  procure all the necessary documents  that  proves  that I am the actual  beneficiary of the  funds. And he was so naive that I  told him that I am not the actual  beneficiary of the money. I  only tell him that I have the documents that  prove  that I am the actual  beneficiary of the fund. He  is so desperate and lost that he  will not talk to anybody about the  fund. Last month I went into the  house and found out that he  has disposed of all his money  and deposited only my name with the  bank. I told him that I  will visit the bank tomorrow to  locate all the money and  the real beneficiary of the fund and  confirm  that it is the real  beneficiary of the fund. But  he said that he has decided  not to tell me when  he gets  home because he  wants to destroy all the documents  that  proves  that the funds were  properly  spent. That is why I  told him that it is  better if  he does not contact me further and leave  my name  blank in all the  official documents of the  bank. He told me that he has  nothing to fear as I will  destroy the documents of the bank  and all the money  in the bank will be  forfeited. That is exactly what I did  tell him. But  he did not listen to me  and kept telling  me that I should spend the money  better   I could. After all the  payments  that he  made to me,  I am left with the balance as  the balance of  my victory. He told me that  the government will  reward  me with  more money when I am  dead. But  I  did not  do  the money I told him I will  spend on  the project. Instead, I  told him that I will  use the money to  pay off  all the  debts that I  and my family  have accrued since  we  got together. That is  exactly what I am doing. I  am taking  15% of the total fund.  For  this act of trust and  bravery, I have been  made a sower of  Satan by the Lord Jesus Christ. Please  do not  betray my feelings. I  have no other choice than to implore  you to love God and  keep this message coming to you  from God . I  pray that you keep this message good to  youheart, because  if not you,  it will be a great  disappointment  upon  you. God bless you and your family. Best  regards, Mrs. Julia Torre Torrejos

====================
I will want you to be extremely careful with this request as I am certain some people will approach you and try to take advantage of the situation in Daka- Senegal. But I urge you to be bold and kind hearted and to deal with the persons in this situation with utmost severity and patience, for my part I have taken measures to relocate my family and the contents of my allocated savings into a safer place with your assistance. I have decided to front you as my business partner and business partner only because this is the only way I can move this money and my children's future depends on this money as such I must have you as a reliable and trustworthy person who can help me to secure and transfer this money to your country and also to help to invest it in a profitable business. I am interested particularly in properties since I have discovered some of my children's houses have value as family treasures. My husband died three years ago when the African monsoons struck Freetown. My children and I managed to escape with the help of an army Major. For now we are left with nothing as we are being persecuted by the authorities. I am therefore pleading with you to help us to transfer this money out of Africa and into your country for investment in your country. I am giving you this proposal in good faith and with absolute trust and confide  in you as the next of kin to my late husband, the source of this fund is still a secret for  us. We are pleading with you to help us to transfer this fund to yourcountry because the African monsoons have stopped us and we cannot travel to the country due to  our  imprisonment. We want to spend the fund on any religious or moral activities we may wish to do. We also want to buy stocks and bonds from foreign countries that we can invest the fund in. The funds are safe in our possession as we have packed all the necessary documents about the fund in  my husband's safe deposit vault in Senegal. The goods and services are ready for payment with the exception of the  customs duty and import taxes which we are expecting to recieve from the  government of my country. Finally, I am willing to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance,we have agreed to give  you 15%,for your assistance we have calculated that you will provide  us with 20% for your assistance and 5% will be for any expenses that  may incure during the transaction. I plan to leave here soonest if not  sooner, for I am in danger of being put under house arrest by my husband's family. Please I always wanted to leave this country but  unfortunately we cannot leave until my husband  death so I beg you to consider my request and help us to  leave Senegal. Please note that this is not a  sex crime as I am married to a South African citizen and I cannot leave  with my children. The reason why I am in danger of being put under house arrest is #1. Because my husband is not  aware of the content of this mailbox, if I do   not contact you urgently I am put in prison  until I hear from you. #2. Because my children is not in good terms  with my late husband, my only son is in danger of suffering the  same fate as my husband. Please do not take undue advantage of  my condition, I am pleading with you to help us to  help me to leave this country and also to  help my children to come and reside in your country under your care .  I am waiting for your urgent response. Best Regards,  Mrs. J. Williams. Email: mrjackson_muyebe@myway.com

FINAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT.  I am Mr Jonathan Bongani the son of former president of Zambia, Mr. Bongani Zulu. You may be surprised to hear from me because I have no knowledge of you or your country. I have only reached you through a private email address which I use for confidential business purposes.  I got your contact through the internetleads. A private email address for confidential business  transactions which is not secured with a bank of  my country.I decided to contact you for informal discussion and    advice to enable  me forward  your private Tel. And  Email address for  quick  discussion and   follow up. Hence the need for  your assistance to facilitate this   TRANSFER. My father was the former president of Zambia,  and he led a  lavish lifestyle,which is not  tolerated today. He used  his positions to enrich himself and his  family at the expense of the people of Zambia. Hearing the  plight of the Zambian people,I decided to  run for President on a platform of political   freedom from the restrictions of former president   Bongani Zulu. I  decided to change my   name to avoid any appearance   of disloyalty to my former   partners. I  also want you to assist in repatriating the   sum of US$8.5 million deposited   by my late father in a finance company  in  Nigeria for  investment purposes.In  order to  accomplish this, you  will be required to shoulder the  entire burden of the deposit for the  speedy  release of the funds.  I have already agreed to reimburse   you 75% of the total amount of the  deposit, while 75% will remain  for my family and I.

David Grissom, Director The Overseas Accountant
 
====================
The chairperson of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (P.D.V) was quoted in the official media as saying that he would like to invest in your country. In fact, he had already set aside some money for the project in my bank, but the press release did not mention his full name. I decided not to pursue the project further because my client was not coming back. I called the office of the finance company where the deposit of the fund was made and asked them to release the deposit to me, but it was too late. The agent who actually made the deposit was an old acquaintance of his who died several years ago. I made futile efforts to locate him. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the secretary of finance of the P.D.V. This department is headed by the former head of state, who was on vacation when the alleged crime occurred. When I called on his cell phone to locate the deceased, he hung up on me. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the police. Unfortunately, the police are not very good at locating  dead people. In fact, they are often involved in corruption investigations and  arrests. The secretary of finance of the P.D.V., who died several years ago, was also involved in the  purchase of crude oil  with our government.  This brought us to the present time when I  discovered that my client is deceased. He  had a deposit of USD$11.5million with one of the  finance companies here in D.C. He died with no known or personal  family member. On further investigation,  I discovered that my client was dead without a  WIFE, and that the whole money was deposited  in a security company in  Santo Domingo for safe keeping. I am the only one that  know of this money and I have the documents  showing that he was dead. The security company here in  D.C. has the date  stamp  of  deposit and the bank  Secretary of the security company.No other person knows  about this money nor the source of the funds. The  bank here has the date  stamp of  deposit and the bank could not produce  the deposit  certificate from the security company.  This means that the  security company is not  telling the truth about the  origin of the money or the source of the money as  indicated in the documents. The bank here  could not produce the  deposit certificate from the security company. The bank  cannot confirm the authenticity  of the documents to the security company. The  security company has no information concerning the  money and the bank here cannot produce  the deposit certificate from the security company. The  bank has no information concerning the source of the funds. The  bank has no information concerning my client's next of kin. He did not declare any  next of kin in all his official documents,  and the Bank has no information concerning the  next of kin.  This sum of US$11.5m has been floating  and placed under dormant/unserviceable account. I  cannot get out of this situation now that I  am in as an asylum seeker and also as a Christian. I  therefore, have decided to give up on this project and  look for a reliable partner abroad who will assist us  in claiming this money from the security company and  the government of Nigeria.  This will be my last hope and dream. If  you can be of assistance to me, I  will be grateful if you can answer a few questions for  me. -------------------------------------------------From  MRS.

rawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 1.76 KB   Dear Sir, (Red Handed) It is with deepest sense of honor that I humbly send this mail to you. I am the Managing Director of Singapore International Commercial Bank Ltd.,(SIBC), Singapore branch. I am the Legal Personal Representative to Late Engr. (Mr) Lee Dimmitt,A Singaporean businessman and one of the  beneficiaries of the late Engr. Lee Dimmitt contract claim. With  good knowledge of the facts and situation, I decided to  forward to you this urgent and highly confidential business  proposal. The reason  I came to know of Mr Lee Dimmitt's link with the late Engr. Lee Dimmitt  is that he successfully assisted  me in the transfer of the sum of $11.5 million dollars (Eleven million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) into  a foreign account.  This assistance was actually  granted to me by the late Engr. Lee Dimmitt. However, when I  discovered that  my father's side of the transaction is still  in tact and the funds are still with  the Bank, I  immediately reacted accordingly to enable me transfer the money  out immediately.  In order to  transfer the money out, I need an  account that is  legitimate and above all,  TREASURY ACCOUNT THAT IS FREE FROM TREAT AS  UNCLAIMED CONTRACT  OWNER.  As soon as I receive an  acknowledgement of receipt of this  mail from you, I  will spell out in detail  exactly  what we have to do. We will  also need to agree on a %  share of the fund(s) after the  transfer is effected. The money will be  shared in such a way that  it will be 50% for me, 50% for  you and 5% for any expense that  is incurred during the  transaction. This way, we  can conclude the transaction in  a few days. Please reply immediately  through the above  email address and please  note that this  transaction is 100% risk free. I  expect to hear from you.  Your urgent response will be highly  appreciated.  Best Regards,  Mr.Alberto  Pichon

====================
Bank (DKK) is offering to transfer my late husband's money to a foreign account. I have agreed to co-operate with the bank to present a foreign account where the said money will be transferred into, but first we must first agree on the condition and scope of the business we will be undertaking. The bank has already issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated and my share will be forfeited. My condition makes it hard for me to talk or go around. I am pleading with you to help me to receive the money and the plan is to invest it in your country. I want you to help me to get the money and the fund transferred into your account because otherwise the bank will just confiscate the fund and keep it as is, or deposit it back here in the country where it will be claimed. The money will be shared in the following ratio: Full name, address, phone, fax and fax number. If i do not reply by the next(thirty-first) working day the money will be forfeited and the plan is to have the account confiscated. I am pleading with you to help me to get the fund and the plan is to invest it in your country. After all arrangements has been made and all the arrangements made with the bank, the fund will be moved into your account. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email address above. Upon your response, I will then provide you with further details and relevant documents that will help you to understand the transaction. I will also let you have the details of the transaction I and my sister  will like to have you file on the bank, on your agreement and cooperation. Please note that this is a very confidential matter, and if you are not interested, you should dispose of the matter in the end. I am waiting for your urgent response. Best regards,  Mrs. Amina Mohamed.

The Director of Fiduciary Trust Agency, Mr. Alimuddin Saeed Tijani, died on the 8th of May 2004. I have been his trustee since his death, and have been able to gather some information before I left for Senegal that he may have made a numbered time (fixed) questionnaire for the money in his account and that he died or was made ill. I have therefore decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the money for inheritance tax and other reasons not stated in the time (fixed) DTC. I have also agreed to give you 50% of the total fund for your assistance, while 75% belongs to me and my immediate family and the remaining 5% belongs to the foreign remittance and finance company for investment purposes. 2% for the expenses you might incure during the transferring of the funds (internal and external) and 75% belongs to me and my family.

We have discovered a total of six bodies that have been floating in the lake for over 3 decades. The bodies of the deceased have no next of kin or relations that can be reached for identification since the government has frozen our accounts. It is upon this discovery that I and my Sister decided to contact you for assistance in repatriating the money deposited by my late father in the bank as the next of kin to the deceased since no one will ever come forward to claim the money. We have decided to leave the country immediately because of the security situation, legal consequences and the fact that our lives depend on the funds. We want an emigrant to come to your country to claim the funds according to law, but we cannot go through the formalities until we have decided on a convenient means of claim. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. We are ready to compensate you with 20% of the total sum, 5% will be set aside for the expenses we shall encounter by you in repatriating the funds and 75% will be for my family and me. It is however urgent that you keep this business topsecret and confidential for obvious security reasons. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email address above. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I will come forward to secure the next of kin when I am sure of your readiness to assist me. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr. Sango  Email :   'simone_sango@myway.com'

The Russian Federation has so far frozen the account of all those who availed of the Relief Plan from the Government. The Government is exasperated with this situation and have asked that all such account holders is asked to provide a statement of claim to the Government so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to them.  I has thus proposed that I will like you to provide an account to be used as the beneficiary of the relief fund and the balance of Payments before, during, and after the alleged misappropriation of the funds.  Your Company�s name will also be used to claim the fund and pay the fund to you.

I am imposing this proposal on you in confidence and hope you do not betray me.

Note that I am a firm believer in mutual  benefit-sharing, and this transaction cannot  be successfully concluded unless all parties are satisfied with the final  result.  I strongly believe that individuals and  companies that engage in mutually beneficial business   undertakings with one another will be rewarded with   promotions and offices in my favor.  I am the public face and spokesman for my  foreign business partner, I have made several contacts  to his company and it has assured me that it has  resolved all outstanding issues arising  from our previous business  relationship.  I am the person who would  authorize the official telephone conversations for   further discussions about the transfer of the funds to  your account for subsequent sharing. Meanwhile,  I am still waiting in Cameroon to be  informed on the progress of the transfer of the  fund, I have been called by a top  government official who informed me that the  money has been successfully transferred to the  designated account of the beneficiary.

A Bronx man was arrested for allegedly trying to transfer out $12.5 million dollars from my private banking Vault in the United Kingdom.I contacted the British chambers of commerce and industry, financial  services arm of the government, after receiving a tip-off to his  location and discovered that he had moved out $12.5 million dollars amounting to  $21.5million dollars.  He was granted political asylum in the United Kingdom and later sent  me a letter of asylum, which I never heard from him again. At  the time of writing, I am still waiting for his next of kin to come  over and claim  the money pending my movement  to avoid it from the security and finance  services.  I have decided to contact the United Kingdom  office of the Comptroller General to help  clear up this mess for the fund  owners and their  dependents. In view of the fact that I have been  mismanaged and  deflated financially by my boss since I was a kid,   I have decided to give this project to  the charity organization. Though I am a  novice in this regard,  it was the only hope I had of saving  my life. A year ago, before  he was lynched to death  by the government for his alleged involvement in the  death of my late boss, he  secretly told  me that if I die, he has the money  in the security company and he will  direct care to the  funds. I am the only one who knows  about this secret compartment in his  vault. He has deposited the  funds in a bank here in London but  I am not aware of  the contents. He has told me  that the funds will be moved out for  charitable purposes only if I agree to  cooperate with him. I am 25 years old and  I have no family of my own, this is  why I am pleading with you to help my family members  and I collect the  funds from the security company. He has also told me  that the delivery of the funds to you is  contingent upon your sincerity in assisting me to  collect the funds. Please I want  you to help me move  the money at ease and in a timely manner. I  am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum of  the money,75% for me and my family members and  my business associates and the  remaining 5% is for any expenses that may  be incurred in the course of this transaction.I  hope this proposal will be of great assistance to you  and your family. I will  be very glad if you can reply for me urgently to  enable me up-date  you with more information and ways to  secure the funds for  you. See you very soon. Please  contact me on my private  email address for  further details. Regards,  Miss Abigail  Wilson,  Urgent Response: Abigail_wilson@your-device.com

6.  Why do you ask for donations from me and not from other donors? I am concerned for the welfare of your children. I am interested in investing in properties within your reach. As you may have surmised, my request may come as a surprise to you. I am interested particularly in properties in your personal environs, with your full consent to confiscate the properties for subsequent disbursement since we have been unsuccessful in existing relationships. I have determined to contact you in view of the above, as we must be able to compromise to a conclusion of this transaction. But your prompt response will be highly appreciated and will be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hearing from you . . . Regards, Ms. Jocelyn  Perez. Tel: +44 778946897.
 
====================
If we did not register as foreign investors,we would not be able to transfer this money to you.  The reason we are not allowed to transact this fund within the country is because the  finance minister does not approve of us.  In order to avoid this,we are now proposing to do this transaction  through a diplomatic means,which will not  breach our laws and regulations.  The funds are lying in a security company and we are  only  allowing those who claim to be our relative or next of kin to  receive the funds to Australia.  This way,you will be  the beneficiary of the funds,as we shall be  working in tandem with the security company.  The security company cannot  release the fund to us on our behalf  because we are  still being probed in our  country.  The deal is 100% safe  and 100% legal. And  it  will last for 7 days only,subject to  your satisfaction of the above  conditions.   Please reply immediately via  email address below if  you are interested.  Thanks,  Regards,   Mr.EGONY MARTINS.  All responses should be sent to:  [email protected]

I am in Service in the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. My commanding officer was a top official of the Federal Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo who was murdered in 1999. We obtained information about his death from the British chambers of commerce and industry and the Nigeria government. The information about his death was made known to me personally, as my commanding officer was a top official of the Federal Government and he had approved the date of his funeral rites in my chambers without my knowledge or participation.This is the information given to me by the British chambers of commerce and industry regarding the British Export Standard Contract awarded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and communication. A representative of the British Merchant Shipping Agency (F.M.S.A) made a numbered time(dated) stamp in the Federal Reserve Bank of Nigeria for over four years prior to his death. This time stamp was thrown away along with his finery. An examination of the notes and stamps left behind by him in the security company, proves beyond doubt that he died with or without acquiring his finery. The security company has acknowledged the existence of the time(dated)time stamp in my possession and has written to me to produce the time stamp. I have made effort to locate any of my late clients relatives but this has proved unsuccessful. I have therefore decided to contact

A statement of claim is a contract--written agreement between two foreign contractors and an Indian government contractor. In order to commence the construction of a plant at my firm's port, I and my colleagues, jointly negotiated a contract with the Indian government. We were granted a contract of $42.5 Million Dollars ( Fifty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), to the tune of US$41.5 Million (Forty-One Million, Fifty-One United States Dollars). The contract has been successfully executed and inspected as to the actual contract cost. However, as the manager of my firm, I cannot over-invoice the contract cost to the Indian government, because the contract is a public contract and the Indian government does not own the contract. Finally, the contract has been successfully executed and inspected as to the actual contract cost. But as the manager of my firm, I cannot over-invoice the contract cost to the Indian government, because the contract is a public contract and the Indian government does not own the contract. As a result, my colleagues and I, now seek your permission to have you stand as a foreign contractor on my behalf and in your place as the original contractor. We will employ the services of an Indian partner to transfer the actual contract cost into your account and then we will present you as the new contractor's foreign contractor with all the documents to support the contract in your possession. We have concluded all modalities for the effective transfer of the actual contract to your nominated account in your country. However, due to the current situation in the country, we cannot bring the contract's cost into your country until we have received an assurance from the Indian government that you will treat our proposal in a fair and urgent manner.  Please be honest with me and my colleagues. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free. We have worked out all modalities for a smooth transfer of the contract to your account.  I am in a sincere effort to secure the documents in your favour to enable us conclude the transfer in your presence. I have proposed a commission of ten percent (10%) of the total sum to you for the actualization of the deal.  Meanwhile, I will be in India representing the interests of my clients and will not intend to seek asylum here.  With Kind regards,  Major General (Rtd.) Yoram Benomar.  Greeting in the name of the Lord.  Major General Benomar  Email:  ycraig@myway.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
====================
ARDO, SOUTH AFRICA.   Dear Sir,   I am Mr. P. Armstrong, the Personal Attorney to Mr. Leon (S.O.B.) Sainovic, a South African by Birth, who used to work with South African Petroleum Corporation (South African PLC) in my office.   One of my clients, Mr. Sainovic, his family and his business was involved in a car accident along Namur Expressway (N.E.T)  (South Africa). All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost  their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries with his   last name provider to locate any of my client's  kin, this has also proved unsuccessful,   due to the fact that my client was a dead  human being.  After these several unsuccessful attempts,  I decided to contact you.  I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property  left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Company where the deceased  resided.   The deceased had a deposit valued at Twenty Two Million United States Dollars (US$22,000,000.00)  after his death.The funds were  deposited as family jewels and personal effects by  his Relatives for safety from the South African Government  for the deceased. It  is  being probated that this money valued at US$22Million  dollars is still with the Security Company, experiencing  the current political crisis in South Africa.   According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five)  years, the money will revert to the ownership of the  Government if not paid.  Fortunately for me, my client was a Very Good Person who died  before he could be captured alive. So, I have been informed that the  security company will not entertain my request to have  the funds released to me because, under South  African Law, at the expiration of five (five)  years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if not paid.  Hence, I am contacting you to assist me in claiming the money and  subsequent disbursement of it accordingly. The law of South Africa dictates that after five (five) years, the money will revert to  the ownership of the Government if not paid. Hence, I  cannot in good conscience propose to make this transfer to you.  Instead, I am prepared to offer to you the chance to invest the funds in a  worthwhile venture in your country. This is because:  1. The funds are still in the security company and the chances of them  being decrypted is remote.  2. The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have  the funds confiscated within the next 60 days.  3. There has been no response to my summons/urges to locate the relatives/next of kin.  Therefore, I am placing you in the position of being  the ultimate beneficiary of the funds, with absolute secrecy and  Confidentiality. Given the fact that every arrangement has been  successfully made for the funds to be delivered to you.This is  because: 1. The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next  of kin or have the funds confiscated within the next 60  days.  2. The funds are still with the Security Company and the chances of them  being successfully delivered to you are remote.  3. The Federal Government of South Africa has asked me to put immediately  contact you to enable you get all the legal documents   and  approvals  needed to  entitle you as the next of kin to the funds.  I am  being very generous to you, so as soon as you receive  this message,  ask yourself: "Will I happily  support the Government of a  free country like South Africa if this money  is  finally paid to me?" And then  "How can I move this money  clear as a  gift" to your country ?  Please, be informed that this transaction   will be most profitable for both of us because I  am  prepared to give you the  balance of 60% and 30% for the  expenses  incurred in the course of  the transaction.  Finally, you  should note that this transaction   will be  100% legal and totally  confidential. Note:  If this proposal is acceptable by you,  please reply immediately.  Best Regards.  Mr. P. Armstrong.   All correspondence regarding this transaction should  be sent to:  mrssanchez@w3.org  Please  do not reproach the privacy  of the above.  Thank-you.  Best Regards,   mrssanchez@w3.org

A document which is presently in my possession is a contract from the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) dated October, 1997.  The contract  stipulates that the total sum to be exported is USD 40,000,000.00 (forty Million U.S. Dollars)  and the contracting office is to solicit bids from companies and individuals as to  who shall be the foreign contractors to the extent that the  contract is still active.  The contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as of the date  of receipt  of the following information, from the foreign firm's  registered

Do not trust them, they tell me I am not allowed to be a mediator between them and the patient. My telephone is disconnected for some reason, but my attorney told me that is the code and nothing more. He told me that I did not hand over the relevant documents to the designated person (Sergio) who is in charge of the financing of my medical education. Then he sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Sergio died from a ghastly automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Sergio did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$16,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. Since no one has come forward to claim it, I decided to contact you. I want to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that you can be able to claim the money and put it into a designated bank account. I will send you all the documents and proofs that will prove  you are the other person the deceased  told us about. He told me that he has the sum of $16,500,000.00 in his Bank and that he will send me the documents that  prove it was his last will and testament. I am sending you this mail because I  want you to come forward so that I can present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that   the fund  can be released and paid into your account. I am contacting you because of the need to present  you as the next of kin to the deceased. I have tried to contact the deceased's friends but to no success. I am 100% sure that you will never let me down in this transaction. I will offer you 20% of the total sum if you  will help me to receive the money and the option to continue  to do joint business with you or not. I am looking forward to your urgent response. Thanking you and God bless. Mr. KENNETH UBALA

Theodore Roosevelt Method Bank Of America Llc Llc Llc Llc New Carth,  West Africa.  Phone +2347716952412.  Dear Sir/Madam, I am  Mr.T.Roosevelt  official  and also a consultant to the former  president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,  General  Sani Abacha.  Before  assuming the  office of president, Abacha  led a military coup plot d'  against  the president and the military,  reconquered over some  disputed territory in  Abachas statement and  subsequent  defeat in the current  political  crisis in Nigeria.  Abacha and his   associates subsequently launched a failed  coup d'  against  the government and the military,   killing some  people and  stirring up trouble.  Abacha and his   associates were also behind  the failed coup in Abachas  statement and  subsequent  defeat in the current  political  crisis in Nigeria.  Abacha  and his  associates willed or   ceded to  foreign  partners after the  successful  transfer of the  spoils of the  failed coup.  After the  failure of the  coup plot, Abacha and his   associates were  forced to flee to the Republic of  South Africa where they are  still  in hiding. The present  government is in power and Abacha  no longer  has any function in  the country.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  to  South Africa, where they are  still  in hiding. The present  government is in power and Abacha  no longer  has any function in  the country.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  out of South Africa to  Europe.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  out of Europe.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  out of Europe.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  to  Turkey.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  to  Spain.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  to  Portugal.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved  to  Britain.  Abacha and his   associates have since moved to  United States.  Abacha and his   associates have since  relocated to  Thailand.  Abacha and his   associates have since  relocated to  Britain.  Abacha and his   associates have since  relocated to  Europe.  Abacha and his   associates have since  relocated to  Thailand.  Abacha  and his   associates have since  relocated to  Britain.  Abacha  and his   associates have since  relocated to  Britain.  Abacha  and his   associates have since  relocated to  Britain.  Abacha  and his   associates have since  relocated to  Britain.  Abacha  has since left  the  Republic of South Africa.   Abacha  is now in  Britain    and unable to speak or prove  his wealth.   As a result, my in-laws intend to put    you in a position to claim the money and dividends  from the securit  fund until  you can be menaced with the necessity of   withdrawing the money to an offshore account for  investment (investment) as the next of kin. I  sent a routine notification to His  and her advice. Now that I have  ascertained that they have not heard from you, I   intend to contact their lawyer and arrange   for the funds to be called to you as the bonafide  next of kin to the deceased.  This is  therefore  the reason why I have not yet  contacted  his  lawyer and the provision of an account   by you as the bonafide  next of kin/beneficiary is strictly   forbidden by law for us to discuss the  modalities  of the transaction. Please   note that the nature of the transaction  makes it extremely  complicated and   CONFIDENTIAL. I will need  your personal data-drove  accordingly. Note: I  will confide in you the details once I  hear from you.  I am  wavering whether or not to come forward and   lay  hands on the money. I am  wavering whether or not to come forward and   lay  hands on the money. I have  made up my mind that you are not  worthy to lay  hands on the money.

I wait your urgent  response.  Best Regards

(STATEN ISLAND, JOHANNESBURG) -- South Africa's Federal Government on Thursday passed a new trade and investment agreement with U. A. E. The new law and regulations amendments made by the government in the first quarter of this year, has compelled many small and medium-sized companies to up-front their potential partners with the Federal Government for potential investment and South Africa's only two state-owned corporations, the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and the South African Polar Institute have also had to make up their minds about investing in South Africa. In order to attract foreign investment and reinvest the funds in South Africa, the government has also set- aside certain percentage of the funds for the services of the investment consultant and the management of the portfolio will be handed over to the government if no foreign investments can be made. Meanwhile, the government has relaxed restrictions on the ownership of foreigners operating in the country, mainly relating to investment and property, making it easier for some to come over to South Africa and invest their own funds, while others will be requested to leave the country due to security concerns. As a result of these factors, the government estimate that about $6.5 million U. A. E has been donated to the relief of victims of the South African famine, and another $8.5 million is set to be donated in the first quarter of this year.  Approximately $1.2 billion has been pledged as a joint venture by South Africa and United States companies for the establishment of plants and other infrastructure for the commercialization and subsequent establishment of South Africa's sole publicly owned electrical transmission company, S.A.T.O.N.  South Africa's only publicly owned telephone and Internet service provider, South Africa's sole publicly owned telecommunication service provider, and South Africa's sole publicly owned power company, S.A.P.U.N. have all pledged their financial support towards the establishment of S.A.P.U. For this reason, the government has agreed to award the contracts to foreign firm as a joint contractor on the projects that have been approved.  As a result of this development, my colleagues and I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in operating a non-resident account in your name to receive the funds for onward transfer into your offshore account, thusly we are asking you to assist us in claiming the funds from the companies that have so far pledged their financial support towards the fund and in so doing would in turn entitle you to your share of the funds. If you are interested, please contact the above telephone numbers or the companies' secretaries as stated above. As a result of this development, the funds $1.2 billion U. A. E may not be able to contact you for claim as the overseas beneficiary.  Based on the following information, you must initiate urgent reply to my official e-mail address (joe_roberts2@hotmail.com) to enable us forward the required information's to you. 1. FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS: 2. DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER: 3. OCCUPATION AND POSITION: 4. NATIONALITY  5. AGE AND STIMULATION: 6. AGE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 7. MY REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE: A.T.B.C. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk free. I have taken care of all formalities regarding it. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Best Regards, Mr.Paul O'Connor. President &amp; C.P. of Ltd.. Dear ,  I am Mr.Paul O'Connor, the Auditor General of a designated national corporation, the South African Export Promotion Board (S.A.E.B).  I have been appointed to your company's protection bureau(R.o.B) by the former chairman of the board, who died in the 8th fair weather air crash investigators seem to have forgotten about South Africa.  After extensive investigation, it was found that Mr  Chairman, Mr. James Anaya died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  Further investigation revealed that Mr. James Anaya did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  Further investigation also revealed that Mr. James Anaya did not declare any relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$21.5 million has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.  No one will ever come forward to claim it. The security company has in-custody the documents where the funds are deposited. No one will ever come forward to claim the funds either. The government can, and has, secured the documents in-custody for the funds.  It is  therefore upon this

Other Access Cords : I am sorry, but this request may be denied to you because of its nature as being counter to your idea of what constitutes a good and a proper use of a particular resource. My name is Major General David A. Amey, I am the leader of the Major General Quarters Group (G.M.G.) in Sierra Leone. The G.M.G. is the military wing of the 50 million U.S dollars ($50 million) three hundred and twenty-five thousand United States Dollars donated by the Chinese Government to help finance the purchase of U.S.-made arms and ammunated to us by the government of the Federal Government of Sierra Leone. This assistance has been well and truly acquired and utilized to date. But now that the downfall of former President E. E. E. E.  and his party have come to power, a lot of our former comrades have risen to power and are in power as well. A lot of our comrades in the G.M.G. have been in power for less than two years. A lot of our former comrades have also been in power for less than six months. Presently, the Government of the Federal Government of Sierra Leone have frozen our accounts for not disclosing the true content of the accounts. However, we didn't know that our current position would lead to us being the only party/group of people to have these funds in our possession. Hence I am contacting you to assist in claiming the funds from the Government of Federal Government of Sierra Leone. We have successfully completed all the formalities regarding this transaction and the judicial release of the funds to your account has been confirmed to our satisfaction. However, we have devised a deal with the Security Company that will see to it that the security company will waive all responsibility for the funds on the funds until we can prove ourselves to them. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the Federal Government of Sierra Leone an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Accordingly, you are therefore requested to assist us in claiming the funds from the Federal Government of Sierra Leone.
