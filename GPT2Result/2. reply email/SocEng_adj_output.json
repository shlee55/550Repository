I would like to  meet the Tuesday following the  teleconference.  I will be in charge of making the arrangements, so please  let me know asap about the teleconference.  I am very sorry I couldn't get with you on that date, but now I  am sure you are annoyed that I didn't get with you sooner.  I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did yesterday, and all  they seem to care about is how  fast they can send money.   I guess their only child has moved in with them, and they don't seem to be getting any younger.  I guess this is why we are not doing  any banking, insurance, real estate, or real estate related things.  We were just discussing how we would like to structure things for when your parents  move in, and how you wanted them to live off of what you had invested.  I  guess I can see why you are upset, but I wanted to first make sure we had not made any rash decisions yesterday, and secondly, that our agreement contained any guarantees or  blinders that you might have had on yesterday.   I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did, or why they are upset, because it would be really awkward to  look them in the eye and tell them I  wouldn't do it again.  My suggestion would be to talk to them on Monday, first, about what happened, and then try to justify or at least minimise  it.   I have texted Fran on this subject, and we agreed that if I ever see her again, I will ask her why she is doing what she has been doing. I  suggest we talk on Tuesday, and then we can discuss  it on Saturday.  I have a hard  time believing your parents would do that, and I just want to talk so I can make amends  with them.  By the way, how is your son doing? Is he doing? Is he doing well? I hope this clears up any misunderstandings, and hope we will talk on Monday about it.       By the way, how is your cousin doing?  I want you to move into the house on up here building next week, and you will move in with me, and then I will move out with your parents.  we will be married 6 months down in May.

Your son has been through quite a few changes since my last  message to him.  He is looking for a new job.  I have accepted his resignation from the  company he was employed with for  three months.  We have had many difficulties in the past,  but it  seems to have gotten progressively more difficult as the years went on.  We finally sold  our old home and moved into a new one,  which is about a mile south of my parents.  It  is a wonderfully clean and new building.  I was wondering if you could use your sweethearts talents and  talents to help my son get a job  - - - - -as soon as possible.  We have not had much luck with the  schools, but hopefully this new business will help us.  This company is in the process of applying to the  United Way for financial assistance.  Your generous gift will be used to  purchase goods that will be of use to our family in the  short run, but we cannot come up with the funds on our  own.  I need your help with the application and I need to gather as much  information as possible before June.  Your kind gesture will be appreciated and have a great day.  Talk to you soon.

I was surprised that you were not more excited about being related to her than being related to me. I guess it has nothing to do with being related to her, but I'm really not sure about being related to anyone else.\n \n Since our meeting last year, I have been in contact with several potential suitor for information regarding your sister. None have contacted me favorably  and several have contacted me negatively. Most of the negative feedback I have gotten has been from women who are unhappy with the unsolicited information that has been sent to them, and  most of the negative feedback has been as such. I have recommended that they contact me through their HR rep, and while I understand if they do not want me to talk to them about something private, I just want to  make sure that they are aware of what I have been up-to-date on.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Mining Consultant and Contractor with the Chevron Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Michael Doran made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron that Mr. Michael Doran died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Doran did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I want you to come forward and claim the money because I cannot claim it myself. I will give you 15% of the money for your assistance and 5% for any expense incurred in the course of this transaction. I will also issue a RESERVoir document which will prove that the funds belongs to you and authorize the post office to deliver the money to you on demand.  All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a genuine arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  I come to you with a very urgent and profitable business proposition.  I have been working in this company for almost a decade and I have decided to give you 20% of the total money while 10% will be for your assistance and 5% will be set aside to offset all expenses in my company and country  while the remaining 75% will be for me and my family investment in your country. Feel free to contact me immediately on my confidential fax number +871-284-958 and thereafter keep quiet about this deal.  I await for your urgent response.  Yours faithfully,  Dr. T.B.

This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I want you to come forward and claim the money because I cannot claim it myself. I will give you 15% of the money for your assistance and 5% for any expense incurred in the course of this transaction. I will also issue a RESERVoir document which will prove that the funds belongs to you and authorize the post office to deliver the money to you on demand.  All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a genuine arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  I come to you with a very urgent and profitable business proposition.  I have been working in this company for almost a decade and I have decided to give you 20% of the total money while 10% will be for your assistance and 5% will be set aside to offset all expenses in my company and country  while the remaining 75% will be for me and my family investment in your country. Feel free to contact me immediately on my confidential fax number +871-284-958 and thereafter keep quiet about this deal.  I await for your urgent response.  Yours faithfully,  Dr. T.B.

I talked to him on the phone yesterday and he assured me that  the mother would not receive a dime of the money if the case went to trial.  That was very reassuring.\n\nIf possible, I would love to participate in the trial on this claim.  And given the nature of the trust issue, I think it is important to speak with someone who is not related to the case or  has had  trouble in the past.  Your willingness to help  someone else when you could potentially benefit  yourself and your family could be an incentive.\n\nIt is urgent that we resolve this issue asap because the mother will most likely win the case and  you will most likely be the first party to testify against the mother.  And given the mother's history, your cooperation might be fatal.  Your cooperation would be a godsend in the  days to come, when we first meet.  I have discussed this with the mother and she has agreed to cooperate with  us.  Will your agreement be sufficient to keep me  confidential? There is a small group of people who share my heart and wish  for  this baby to be born  that I can be  present for.  My commitment to you is based on my previous  offers of support and honest sharing of  information.  If you do not have space for a meeting tomorrow,  maybe in the morning.  I would love to hear from you about something  positive.  I have space for only one other person at this time.  A meeting with this person in a  couple of weeks will allow me to gather more information.  Then  I can present the mother with the information she needs  to know in order to make a decision.  Your willingness to share your thoughts and prayers for me and my family is exactly what I was searching for.  It is extremely important that we resolve this conclusively  so that I can be there for her and my son.  If my faith has any value,  it has been eroded by this whole ordeal.  If you believe that sharing my heart is a sin,  you need to come to Jesus.  I need you to forgive me for not having come to you in such a short time.  The trust issue is killing me.  My search for truth and healing is more important than ever.  I need  to find a way to truly connect with my family and friends.

I am a cobbler/contractor with the federal government of Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999 an American mining consultant/contractor with the Federal government of Nigeria, Mr. David Hill made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00 (forty Million, United States dollars) into a foreign account.  After the success of our last payment attempt on the matter, the director of finance in the federal government of Nigeria, Mr. Abdul Hakim El-Hasay made another (Fixed) Deposit for the same amount of money, this time to a foreign account.  Upon maturity the money was sent to my customer, a French firm based in Singapore, Malaysia, registered as a beneficiary, but upon maturity the mail was returned undelivered.  I discovered that Mr. David Hill and his wife were both involved in a car accident and died on the spot, leaving nothing for the production of the new cheque.  I have therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. David Hill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$40M is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the late mongabay employee to seek for asylum in the Republic of Nigeria. All documentations will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside United State of America Policy of Non-Resident Foreign Investors.

I am Mr. Mohamed Ubarri (\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0646\u062d\u0645\u0631), a banker at the Federal Reserve Bank of Nigeria (FRB) . I write you this proposal following a routine review of our books and confidential file in the file cabinet. We have around $10.5Million cash and safe in our custody, pending my arrival to meet with you. This is to enable us process a transfer of the other half of that million to you and then your company account. I have worked here for the past 11 years and I have the backing of my bank. I am 64 years old, and my health has declined considerably. However, I have not gone bald nor am I sick. I have not got cancer. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this letter so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, tender your sincere condolences to Mrs.Ann Clark. You can reach her on her private telephone number as well as her private e-mail address.

He is the chief legal officer of Genesis, Inc. and headed up by his son, who took an unpaid leave of absence.  It is a matter of great shame that his son would do such a thing.  It is a very dark time in our lives and I would not want my son to go through what he has had to go through.  I wrote to my son earlier today, and asked him to pray for me and for those who were dear to him.  It is a matter of great importance that he be in a position of leadership within Genesis, so I wanted to be sure that he was aware of what was best for me and for his family.\n\nAs it turned out, however, his leave was just so he could tend to his business.  When he came back, he told me he was very upset that he had to leave so soon, and that he was going to do his very best to salvage whatever soul he felt was left.  He said that he would write a detailed letter to me explaining what had happened, and how he was going to fix everything.  This was very upsetting, as I had hoped that he would keep everything as is, and that everything would be okay.  After his letter was all finished, however, he took off on his Vespa and we drove back to Houston in his car.  Honestly, it was pretty scary in that moment.  I remember telling my son that the world was gone and that he would miss it if he ever got out.  I guess that is the nature of the unknown, and to a certain extent, the whole thing scared him.  At the very least, this time it was a little different.  The big scary things happen to people, and that is exactly what happened to me.  A series of strokes limited my ability to drive for a few days, and I finally got my license on December 13.  I could drive, but only, because I had a really good reason. I couldn't get any sort of a good position with insurance. I was just starting anew, because I couldn't get my son started the credit card company. I couldn't get him a good job, and I had a bad credit check my husband to take care of him, and we couldn't live in the house to help him with our young daughter to just such a bad rep (our old age where he needed an apartment to help him.

The topic of our upcoming meeting is very interesting to me.  Last year I traveled to Kiev to visit the Truth and Justice Party, a group that was created to promote the interests of the people of Ukraine.

I will definitely try my best to help in any way that I can.  I visited the Truth and Justice Party last spring and was pretty impressed with how committed the people of Ukraine were.  Now that I am here I want to help in any way that I can.  I hope that you and the group of friends can help me can help in some way in making sure that the people of Ukraine have a better future.  I will be in contact with Anna Chas one of the women involved in the Truth and Justice Party.  I want to help her in any way that I can.

I have lost consciousness and all the members of my family have gone to the hospital to recover me. The doctor said that I may not live for the next three days because I am sucedful to treat my public speaking. So, I am taking this opportunity to let you know that we have decided to part company with one another and have put our company directorships.

I served for about a year  with great pleasure and satisfaction.  I have the honor and privilege  to be married to a man who is from my  hometown and raised in the same neighborhood.  He is a son of my great-grandfather and my step-grandfather.  He is a son of my great-  great-great-grandfather,  and my great-great-great-grandfather's great- grand- son.  He is a member of my family and raised me in the same  neighborhood as my parents and great- great-great-grandfather.  I am very happy to be married to a man who is from my  hometown and raised in a home I know I can count on  to be there for good reason.  My fianc\u00e9e is an account manager for an engineering company in San Diego, CA, and we actually got engaged last summer.  She is now a school teacher, and I am very happy  to be involved with her as she continues to improve and  become a better account manager for the company.  My goal is to help her become the person she wants to be.  I have done my best to help make that happen.  When we first started dating, I thought he would be more interested in talking about his career path, than we  were.  Then we started dating, and he insisted that we get engaged first.  We met twice, and tied the knot last year.  I think it is fair to say that we were very committed before then, based  on the dates and commitment we made earlier in the year.  I think it is time to move on and get it over with, rather  than having it continually fresh in our minds.  I was not exaggerating when I said that this year will be different.  I am so  happy that you are with someone new and have decided that you want to be a part of my life, rather  than me continually trying to remind you that it is different.  I am  very glad that you decided to come to San Diego, because it has been an absolute blast so far.  We have been together for one semester, and I think we are set up for a great fall.  My summer was much like mine, only I was in LA for one semester and spent a few  weeks in Tijuana.

Some people in the Enron organization are asking us to  wait on the FERC to act, since the FERC was already involved in the  proceeding with the Iowa Independent  Gas Company.  We need to get this  done asap and no later  than March 2.  The rest of C-Sherpa has fully cooperated with the  investigation  and the FERC has refused to share information that would  incriminate C-Sherpa in any way.  We have appealed to the  Administrator of the FERC for information and  a plan B has been provided.  The  plan B is based on the presumption that C-Sherpa  will cooperate and that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company.  The  Administrator has provided limited  information and, at this stage,  seems to be taking the position that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company.  The  assumption that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company is not in the  spirit of cooperation and mutual trust that our Founding Fathers fought so hard to create.  It is time for us to set a new  foundation for trust and reconciliation.  We need to set an example for other  business to follow and, in turn, for  ourselves to live up to. This is a huge win for the employees of C-Sherpa and a huge loss for the  enemies of our company.  I will be out of the office  March 31, along with my wife.  It is very upsetting to think about all we have lost and only a small  part of what we really are.  We took on this fight and came out the victor.  I am so very sorry that this has  ever  happened.  I have lost everything that I know and loved.  My oldest son has been  missing for two weeks and my step-daughter was abducted and murdered.

All of the above-mentioned persons are named as co-counsel or advisers to the business.\n I was approached by a client who wanted to become an adviser to your company but who was not an  Enron employee.  He wanted to become an adviser to your son but who was not an Enron employee.  What kind of ethics code does your son live by?  What sort of contract do they have?  What sort of privacy policies do they have?  How about an apology from the company?  You would think that this could be avoided if Enron had  never existed.  But because  this is a family business,  the law firm that I used to work for recommended that we not bother.  Our goal should be getting our son into an AM school as fast as possible.  Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.\n \n I agree with you that this situation is not right.  I will be out of the office  on Monday, and my  son and daughter will be starting school together.  I was not going to do anything that would  be perceived as a \"sin\" by our family.  Let me know if anything has changed since we last spoke.  I will be glad to make a point  in their favor.  If you feel that we need to talk more about this,  you will want to call me back on Monday.  Otherwise, keep in touch.\n \n Take Care\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: MR JACK COLE\nTitle: URGENT MESSAGE FROM MR JACK COLE\n URGENT MESSAGE FROM MR JACK COLE FROM:MR JACK COLE COLE SIGMODA LUKU BUR 1 ,WEST AFRICA PLC   27 STATE ROADS, AFRICA. 2 MON TRUNC MARKET, ALABAMA.

Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia and my efforts in searching for a reliable and reputable business partner. I am writing you based on the recommendation to my secretary who happens to be a prospective business man as he is now in his mid-30s. I am writing you because I discovered some money while I was on a business trip to your country a year and a half ago. The source of the fund is a secret and it is being kept very carefully in a bank vault in my country. The amount in the vault is $12m USD and the owner of the vault is  a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) living in (Nigeria) who has an account opened in the bank in (Nigeria) and died on 9th November 2001. His next of kin is a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) who died in the same accident(he was in a motor accident) and his account in the bank is closed. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for the money as his Foreign partner. I cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. When this discovery made me to contact you, I felt that you would be in a position to assist me in  receiving this fund in your country as I have applied for refugee status in your country as a refugee. The banking ethics here stipulates that after five years the money will be transferred to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. In order to avoid this, the bank now proposes that you as a Foreigner or Australian resident should help me to have the documents proving my identity called up to the court and show that I am the person that actually made the deposit. This is simple and requires the absolute co-operation of both of us. You must apply first to the court to enable the relevant documents to be sent to the court and then I will apply to the court for the transfer of the funds to your account. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I shall be very glad if you accept my proposal in good faith and acknowledge the receipt of this letter in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor, though I do hope you will not feel pressure to assist me. May Allah bless you and your family as you see fit. Please do not make undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed.

The contract language clearly commands that he cannot have access  to our financial information.  Your response should be as soon  as possible, as the other party may ask us to `fix' their accession to our country.  Otherwise, our  financial information would be very useful to them, as we share the same name and have the same general coverage.

This crisis is especially  personal for me as I have been through quite a few   emotionally.  My oldest son was just released from the hospital and back in the living room  where he was immediately placed in a car and driven to the nearest hospital,  where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and has been  held for several hours without any sign of improvement  despite having been in a coma since his admission.  His neurological exam  showed significant blood flow to the  left  shoulder and this pain that never goes away makes it more etiologic than ever.  This event is taking up valuable time that  should be devoted to other  important things, such as establishing   relationship with his family and finding the best care  for him.

Please can you look at the other ones I have sent already. The signature on this one is not too bad, but I must change the first 10 digits. Please can you change that?  It is much too late to bother anyone else,  especially since I sent this to one of  your contact, and there is nothing  that you can do about it.\n\nI can't believe you did not get back with me first, so I am going to go out on a limb and assume you did, and send  you another one.  Sorry I did not get back with  you, I am out of the office now.\n\nIt is ok though, I just wanted to check on a possible settlement, if you had any  doubts about  sending me another one.  After all, I have your address and we just signed a new one, right?\n\nLet me know if you want to send me another one, and I will get back with  you ASAP about the settlement.  I just wanted to  see how much time remains in the day, so we can work out the settlement, if any  doubt arises, just ask.  This is just an  example, I am going to send another check next week, with my new address, to remind you of the time  difference.  You have no idea how many emails I get, and how much time  it takes to send each one.  So, I just wanted to  see how your reaction was to the new address, and to see how we are doing, when you send your  first one.  If you send me your feedback at all, I will keep this example in mind, so you can see how we are doing, and how difficult it is to get  everything done.  You have always wanted to be my servant, and I could not agree more.  We finally broke up, and I moved in with my girlfriend, Stephanie, because I could not get myself to leave you.  I had to get myself out, and she had to get myself out, because we broke up 5 months ago.  Now, we are fine, but I just wanted to  go home, and try to put the past  behind us.  I am so glad you were not in on the break up, that would have really  devastated me.

I, too, was touched by the hospitable attitude of your hospitable, empathetic, and understanding wife. In fact, I wrote to her yesterday to say how much I enjoyed our \"free\" time together as family. She replied that it was not a lot of time, but she was very interested in getting to know you better and was very appreciative. She encouraged me to keep in touch and to stay connected to my family in SF. I plan on doing just that.\n\nI have always been interested in your intellectual side, so I was delighted when you suggested we take a \"family\" vacation.  I was on a blind date with a guy I met on the job search committee. His name is not familiar to me, but his CV is very interesting.  I was impressed with how much time out of the country he has already put into the job search, and his passion is clearly in making it a difference in people's lives.  We will be spending a few weeks in Texas helping older kids with English asyleensities, and he has a lot of experience in that area. My wife is a kids program for them, and I thought I had a low threshold need of an income as well.  I was hoping he could help on the kids from him in the tech side.  I have them in tech in house, but he is a tech for tech, and tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I am so we enjoyed spending time together was discussing how we decided we hit upon returning next move to have kids and plan for January (saturday we will be here in May, but we need of clothes and we need of a new place, and the kids to take stock to the kids.

Prior to this last serious crisis that is still ravaging in my country,which recently led to misfortune of our government and my late husband position in the government,we were able to come over here in Thailand ,we inherited the sum of USD32 million. The funds were originally gotten from my late husband proceeds. My late husband was able to safe guard the fund with a very good diplomatic contact from my Country, who provided me with the assistance of an Attorney, as I have indicated, to invest in Thailand .

The Managing Director of ACE Asia Pacific, which is   a branch office of HSBC in Thailand, is interested in investing in   the oil and gas sectors.   My family and I are however, not able to participate  in this venture at this stage because we are  not sponsored by ChevronTexaco or Shell,   entities that you are aware of.   However, we are looking for partners that are committed to   creating jobs and  restoring prosperity to our countries.   You are aware that I have been involved in various forms of non-governmental activity  related to the economies of t he two countries for a number of years now.   I believe that this is something that I am good at.   I hope that you are not wondering why I am not sending my son to school  or why he is not attending church.   If you are interested in contributing to this venture,  please contact me.   The project has not started  yet but I do have some compelling reasons.   As you probably know, my wife is an attorney and we have accepted an  additional child into the family last year.   We finally sold our old  house and moved into a new one; this new home is much larger, better equipped with everything you need to  live in it for the next 6 months.   We finally bought a big enough house that we can call our own.   All of this has prepared me for the challenges ahead.   I have not had the pleasure of being your spouse, however, I have had the privilege of being married to the love of my life, Jose Luis  Son.  We finally got married on September 22, 2000, in the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House.   We celebrated our union in the Rose Garden with my mother and sister, and my step-father and step-mother-in-law.   I was 18 at the time.  Since then, I have been married to the love of my life, Jose Luis  Son, and we have a son and daughter-in-law to raise.   We finally sold our old house and moved into a new one; this new home is much larger, better equipped with everything you need to live in it for the next 6 months.

Prior to this last serious crisis that is still ravaging in my country,which recently led to misfortune of our government and my late husband position in the government,we were able to come over here in Thailand ,we inherited the sum of USD32 million. The funds were originally gotten from my late husband proceeds. My late husband was able to safe guard the fund with a very good diplomatic contact from my Country, who provided me with the assistance of an Attorney, as I have indicated, to invest in Thailand . For your assistance I have propose to give you 25% of the total sum, I have further advised that the remaining 70% be for you,your contribution is non-refundable. Please, note that this transaction is hitch free and the success of this transaction depends on your impeccable confidentiality and full co-operation. I hereby introduce myself to you, because I need your urgent assistance. Your contact address is confidential and completely safe; please kindly reply by return mail only to elope_tiger@yahoo.com and use my private telephone line for more detailed information.

The actual amount in the account is(U.S.$2,220,000.00)two million, ten thousand two hundred and twenty united state dollars (us$2,220,000.00).However, the management decided to look for a trust worthy foreign partner abroad, who will assist us in repatriating the fund to his country, or any other country of his choosing, as soon as possible because the management no longer knows the client's foreign account holder or beneficiary.The foreign account holder is a deceased account holder in a number of different countries including the UK, USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and China. The account was opened in these countries without any other person knowing about it.The account has expired and all attempts to track the account owner have come to naught.I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the Audit Committee of the F.N.A.W (A.C.A) to look for a foreign account to receive the fund on behalf of the management, as all documentations will be in the management's control and we will share the money accordingly.

Please advise on the most efficient method to achieve this.  An address  would be ideal since we need to obtain a business license in California to operate.  Assuming we get the  necessary paperwork, it should be quite simple to obtain a temporary  business  license to operate.  The other issue is how TO obtain a business license in California.  Currently, there are no guidelines  for obtaining a business  license, and quite a few hurdles to clear.  Please provide me with some guidance to get me started on this path.  I have been in contact with several business  licensees in California who seem to be issuing  licenses in large numbers, and who I would definitely want to  discuss with you ASAP in order to get a head start on the necessary paperwork.  Depending on your response, I will send you information about how to get my finger  on the pulse of California licensing.  We just had a pretty big  surprise when it came time to renew our business  license.  My response  is still pending, but my hope is that you will allow me to continue in this  area pending our appeal.  In the meantime, I have started to receive a flood of tips from around the globe regarding our  situation.  It is amazing how quickly information can travel   freely during a 24-hour period.  Thanks to all of you for your assistance.   I can't believe our business did not work out   with such a dramatic impact on our family.  I was away from home on business for the weekend, and my son and daughter  were both sick and had to be removed from the hospital.  My family is  still very much bonded together, and I have received so many beautiful cards from around the world.  I  love every single one of them, and I send them all back home with the greatest  gratitude.  My only regret is that our marriage failed to take off, and that my absence has limited our  family's independence.  Our relationship is stronger than ever, and I am excited about the future.   My son is in college, and my daughter is on her first year of  graduate school.  We want to start a family, and I am  planning on starting a family with him.  My oldest son is in the hospital\u00a0 with a hip replacement, and he is out until June 2.

I was wondering if you could call me ASAP and discuss the most  expeditious way to close a US$350M ($585MM loan) unfunded foreign direct investment (FDI) project in your country.  It is a long-term project and requires a lot of finance, but there was no apparent way this could be funded without adversely impacting US manufacturing. You did mention that the project should be in place by May 2010, which seems to be a reasonable horizon for a project of this duration.  I  presume that you received this message in your system as well, but could you look at it and let me know if there are any  problems with it before I forward my response.

I am aware of the consequences of this proposal  but I feel it is my duty as an Account Officer to her country or  any other part of the world where my money will be safe to do business  with the person or company that will benefit from the transaction.  My proposal is that you will be given 20% of the total sum  for your services, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for  the expenses incurred in the course of the transaction. I have all necessary  legal documents that will back you up when telling the fund to turn over the  money to the person you want it to be given to.  All I need is some trust and confidence from you. If you can be of  trust and assistance to me, I will greatly appreciate it, please reply to my private  email address on the above. But please do not reply to my official  mail: (vollebank@she.com)  I want to assure you that this business is 100% risk free as we have  conducted all the arrangements with the relevant Government Agencies,  as we have proved in our last audit report to be accurate and  legal, with full legal documentation to back up our claim,  you can be assured that this transaction will be properly handled with absolute  confidence.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately by  expediting the above indicating your interest for us to discuss the modalities of  seeing this transaction through. I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be maintained at all  stages, as this is required for the success of this transaction.   Be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because  of the volume of money involved.   Keep in mind that we are professional and  organized people and this business must be carefully managed for  optimal profit potential.

This portion of the deal is fine-tuned to avoid these sorts of issues.

He was kind enough to send  me a link to his website and a short time later I got  this e-mail from him.  It  looks like he's upgraded his services to be more in line  with the \"no fakes\" policy that his business is based upon.   He is an Enron Certified Public Account  maker, so you are welcome to use his services  however you wish.  If you wish to  request a \"no fakes\" policy in exchange for a service that I can provide, then you would do well  to request that I provide it now in exchange for a service  that you may not be able to provide in the future.

JOHN KOA\n\nYour comments were very helpful and I am pleased to hear that your son is doing well.  It was a pleasure to talk with you today and look forward to meeting with you and your family in the near future.  As to the transaction, I have spoken with my wife and we will not be able to travel immediately so we will have to take a bus.  Bus ride would be ~$20-$30 and transfer is not as expensive as you may think.  What's left after transportation to Orlando or Miami?\n\nI need to get back to Seattle ASAP so we can get our son an attorney and finally make our decision.  It is very unclear right now what the law requires before we can sell the property.  I know you are concerned about his future so I want to be sure we are doing everything we can to make sure he is not in danger.  Please do not hesitate to call or email me if you want to talk about the transaction or have questions.\n\nThanks\n\nJesse Morris Eckhart III 503-464-2201\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: MR.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of a company of which I was one of the few contractors that actually performed the project.

Myself and my partner are weighing legal issues.  Should we try to enfeeble a contract and beg forgiveness from the poor god?  Our pastor actually suggested we do just that.  The courts would probably think we were trying to steal something, as we had never bothered to get a court order before.  Judge William Rehnquist was very interested in what our business is.  He wanted to hear from our \"innovators\".  Our business is basically a series of \"marketing\" ideas that no one has tried yet.  Don't we have an \"innovator's dandy\" gene?  We need to show him that the technical know-how we picked up in college is actually transferable and that we can develop viable and valuable business ideas in the time it takes to make your day, or to make your day if we do steal something.  It's much better to have a brilliant, if somewhat embarrassing, series of presentations that show you how to make a living than have it blown out of proportion.\n\nWe may as well just try to start a \"Company B\" to market, since we already have a \"Company C\" under our belts.  I'd argue that a company C is actually in much worse shape than a \"traditional\" oil company.  Most of my \"innovations\" were actually conceived as a hedge against default, rather than as a start up.  If we want to make money, we need to raise capital, and if we raise capital, it's better if we do it now rather than wait till \"The Black Swan\" dies.  The insurance companies didn't exactly love \"The Black Swan\". \n\nI'm not saying we can't have nice things.  I'm saying we should have nice things to look forward to rather than looking forward to the worst case scenario.  That being said, I don't think \"the worst possible\" scenario is going to happen anytime soon, and there's a reason why we're in it.  \n\nI'm not trying to start a \"company B\" today.  I'm trying to buy a business that can help \"the people\" in your area.  That's it.  You're not going to start a business that can help people in a time of need.  And the insurance that you and your \"innovators\" have built up doesn't even factor into this.

There is a gold mine in my country and my Government has approved the purchase of gold and other goods from the government importer corporation for shipment to my country.

The deal is simple; I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary; I will give you 30% of the total money while 10% will be for reimbursement to both parties and the balance 70% will be for me. All is under official arrangements and all we need is to follow the instructions of the  private security company which will hold the goods for us.

There is a gold mine in my country and my Government has approved the purchase of gold and other goods from the government importer corporation for shipment to my country. The goods will be delivered to my private security company for safe keeping and safe investing. The deal is simple; I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary; I will give you 30% of the total money while 10% will be for reimbursement to both parties and the balance 70% will be for me. All is under official arrangements and all we need is to follow the instructions of the  private security company which will hold the goods for us.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil Merchant/Contingent with the Thai Petrochemical Corporation, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,300,000.00, (Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Thai Petrochemical Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,300,000.00 has carefully and precisely been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Thai Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Thai Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Clifford Stone so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that a lawyer will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of a reputable and honest Foreigner as a favourer and the legal agreement will be executed under my supervision and direction.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply.

If you are interested, let me know so that I can get started.  I have started discussions with the Texas farmers market and think that it may be beneficial to have you involved.  My goal is to get a head start on filing the various forms that are due in May.\n\nThere is still some time yet- just ask the Iowa farmers market what they want and I'm sure you'll be able to help them- they were very helpful in getting me involved in the first place.  By the way, what is your address?  I'm at 339 South Florida Ave., #211, Chicago, IL 60601.  Call or write me at (773) 8 Job-search.  I'll be glad to help in any way that I can.\n\nLove, Dad\n\np.s. Dad, what's the matter?  I feel like I've been abandoned by the church.  I just got back from a trip to Mexico and I'm still in a funk over what I did.  I'm still in the car and getting into the apartment complex.  I'm not sure I can get back to Chicago before lunch.  I might be able to help around the home stretch.  I just don't know- yet.\n\n-am\n\np.s. Happy Father's Day.

I have been out of the shower and my aunty noticed me in the morning and suggested I went to the lavatory.   I have never gone to the lavatory before and was a bit afraid I'd miss out.  My aunty is a lovely person and it's not like I go out with her on a regular basis.  I usually just come home  with a tray of soap and water.  She suggested I ask her to take me out dancing if I was going to miss out on a night out.  I was going to ask my dad about  getting into a nightclub and if he was going I thought I'd ask him why  it took so long to get into a club.  I was going to tell you about my plan to go out with a girl I know and had a bit of a falling out with my ex-girlfriend.  It's not something I've really talked about with any new people and had a hard time coming to terms with how I felt about it.   I was going to ask you how things went down the last time we went out.  I didn't want to be a bother but I was so broke up over it all that I couldn't be bothered to get into the club.

Please provide me with an estimate of how long it will take to resolve your other  pending issues such as your children.    I need to know  ASAP how much longer it will take to resolve some issues with your children  and I need a clear heading start on those. \n\nI appreciate your reasonable caution with this proposal.   If your child is a legal resident of  England, or Wales, their parents should have received instructions setting  up that country to receive the E.B. (see below).   However, because this is a UK initiative, our  legal representatives are in the difficult position of explaining to non-UK  legal residents that this initiative is only for them, and they must be  subject to the same stringent registration, reporting and financial management requirements as  resident  England, Wales or Scotland.  We have already had two legal residents  who quit because of this requirement, and we cannot start from scratch.  You have been  very helpful in resolving this issue.   I now have instructions that will direct my team  towards how we need to resolve this issue.  We need to have a solid plan B in place ASAP so that our  legal team can focus fully and impartially on this issue.   This legal resident has never been a\u00a0 part of the Enron family, and we do not want to turn that around.  By default, they are no longer legal residents of  England, so any changes in their status will be temporary,  and they will get back to normal soon enough.   We need to ensure that they are filing their income tax returns  as soon as possible, to be completed in time to participate in  the FE country exchange program.  They will be  required to file that return no later  than January 27, and we want to start preparing for that date before then.   We need to determine, from our limited  evidence, that the UK legal resident will have a hard  time making it through the January 27 transition, and we may never see them  again.   If you and  your family are interested in meeting with this individual, or in  following up on his previous contacts, please contact me ASAP so that we can continue working on this  issue.    This individual is very interested in pursuing a J-1 visa, and we need to get  something done before that process is complete.

MRS FARAH AL-HAShemi\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISATION\nDear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:\n \n I have heard that you are involved in an interesting project.  Your company, TecTip, has won a couple of contracts with Petro Canada and will soon be getting another one with Chevron - Texaco.  Your involvement with these companies is mutually beneficial - your experience making them comfortable and the training you have provided their technical staff will be beneficial to them. \n \n Unfortunately, your involvement with these companies is not without its problems.  First, some contracts are very specific in nature and require specific approval.  Your involvement with these companies is therefore limited to that which is defined by your employers.  For example, our friend the Calgary Firm (Calgary, Alberta-based) are looking for a Chief Compliance Officer and he or she should familiarize yourself with the contract processes and issues that are specific to this company. \n \n Your contract expertise is definitely needed - why not apply for a company drug contract if you have some contract-writing experience under your belt? \n \n Alternatively, you could apply for a limited liability company drug contract if you are familiar with the various insurance company structures.  These are generally more advantageous to us since we do not have to worry about individual policy holders having policies with different companies. \n \n If you are not already involved in development, then your involvement would be beneficial in two ways.  First, your ongoing mentoring and mentoring programs can be extremely beneficial to our company since it is through these programs that we have been able to attract talented individuals such as yourselves.  Additionally, your ongoing efforts to increase the number of women in management positions throughout the organization can be very beneficial to our company since it is through these positions that our women employees are contributing to our company culture and earning the respect of their managers. \n \n If you are interested in contributing to either of these endeavors, your contributions would need to be in the form of time-limited stock options that vest over a period of up to one year at a time or in the form of cash grants that vest in annual installments.  Contributed stock options are currently only granted to certain employees, former employees and their spouses.  Employees must complete a certain series of activities to contribute to contribute to the plan and qualify for stock awards.  Grants are not given to certain applicants who is the plan's employees or to whom.  Non-  Plans also very limited to what level of the plan - no contribution cap  there is available to plan contribution.  Plan contributions are based on a plan", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mrs Farah al-Hashemi\nTitle: I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISATION\n I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE  PLEASE  FIND AIDING YOU IN ADVANCE OF THIS MONEY BY  RECEIVING THIS MONEY INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

I was under the impression that you did not think the urgency would be significant,  that it would pass  without much notice.  In addition,  given the nature of the transaction, the due diligence steps seem to be unnecessary,  and there may be some administrative over take required before the due diligence steps are complete.  The transaction I believe you are referring to,  the pay as you go option, which I think should have been taken about 3 months ago,  and which I am now negotiating to try to get cancelled.

The Late Favour of my client, after his Death, was made out to be paid in kind to the tune of 16.315 million United State Dollars (US$16.315M).However, after we got the money to 16.315 million, the Benin Government came to our rescue and asked us to release the money to them, without prior arrangement being made with me.  And so, I and other government officials, on instructions from the highest authorities in the Benin Republic, have already made arrangements with the banks here to process the money and had it in this country, before we knew about the disaster that befallen my country on 9-11-01. The banks where I did this have written us to front to you an agreement that we must all live our lives happily ever after. This is the understanding we have found in our dealings with the bankers. In order to-claim this fund, we need a confirmed claim in your name, and we want us to settle down here in London so that you can stand as our foreign partner and receive this fund into your account.  If this proposal satisfies you, please reply immediately, furnishing me with your top line information to enable us start the process of processing your claim. I expect your urgent response. You can reach me on my alternative email: (richmondjames2@indiatimes.com) I also have the pleasure of knowing you, since we have not known before, if you are interested in this transaction which is risk free, and also a guaranteed success, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending via my confidential fax line, which I use to tend to my personal and business affairs. Incidentally, I have just received a letter from my banker stating that I have  sufficient trust to handle this transaction with absolute confidence, which I intend to give to you. I will appreciate your response. Please reply to my private and confidential email: (richmondjames2@indiatimes.com) Regards, Dr.Bryan Nville.\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE\nDear MR.

Her college is in the Atlanta, GA area and she is currently studying for her Master's Thesis. I need to know as soon as possible so that I can get her started on her next step. My age is not an issue as I am starting to feel the anxiety of an older sibling. My response times on the phone and in person are generally very good.  My reservation is for when I am going to be away for the summer. That being said, I have not been the most active member of the family for many years.  I am 65 years old now and have been with the family for about a year.  I am currently involved in an adopt a family program in which we take in a family with a disability and help them get adjusted to our community.  It is a very young family and they are definitely family.   My sister is involved in a psychology program at Ercoles which is run by the local chapter of the Salvation Army.  She is very committed to the cause and has a passion for helping others.  She volunteers with various local groups in the area and in September will be taking psychology classes for the rest of her junior year at LSU.  At LSU she will be studying under Dr. Kenneth Mitchell.  If you are interested in contributing to this family, I would love to receive it.  Your donation will be tax-deductible.  Your donation is tax-deductible if it is sent to a church or charity that will take it from there. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to help these families in the short amount of time they have.  Even if we could, there would still be a period of time in between when they need you the most and the taxman isnt going to let you do this just to please the government.  If you are interested in contributing, please contact me now to set up a time to help them during this time. They will of course need your donation to keep the electricity running in their area.   I can also help them with an offer for a summer job placement if you are interested in contributing.  This family is sponsored by the local chapter of the Salvation Army and they are helping this family get set up.  If you are interested in contributing, you must be at least 18 years of age and able to contribute to the project.  You must be able to contribute at least $1000 per month for the family.", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Dr.Kunle Owolo\nTitle: HELP ME PLEASE\n HELP ME PLEASE FROM: Dr.Kunle Owolo UNION BANK OF AFRICA PLC EASTERN TAYO RIMI CANNON A/C LITTLE ROCK TEMPOERY X-RAY LAGOS NIGERIA Electricity Generating Plant (AGPP) ACT AS X-RAY LAMP DESK OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) MACHINE HEAD QUARTERS HEADQUARTERS LONDON EC3U 8AY UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC.

Unfortunately, my health is beyond  salvage.  Not only has your worry about my well-being contributed to my unhappiness,  it has also hindered my ability to do my job with care and concern for others.  My days as a trader in CRE's real estate market are numbered.   You have always shown concern for me and my family, even when things didn't go your way.  You have always believed in my abilities and have worked hard to earn that confidence.  I owe you that.  My goal as your employer is  to provide a high-quality, reasonable job to an employee with a passion for the   trading business.  This is very different than what I ever believed was the case.   I was an energetic, confident young man eager to please my boss and improve my   position in life.  That is not the case anymore.   I wish I could help people  with my positive energy and optimism.  That is what really matters.   I am  not interested in arguing with people about what is or isn't a good time to  go to school, or what my schedule is like.  Those things don't matter when I get involved in a fight with my boss, or when I feel like giving money to my  estranged wife.   I would never do those things.   Instead, I try to help people  with issues in their lives, usually through positive reinforcement in the form of a constructive criticism.   My hope is that this new relationship will help  people make peace with their problems and move on from bitterness to love.   I have always wanted to be your partner and co-worker, not your enemy.   I hope we can find a positive energy in this relationship that will help  people to heal and stay positive.   If you feel that I'm not serious about the fight, maybe you would be interested in discussing this with  someone else.  I would love to be your partner and co-worker, but I need to focus on this fight.   I need  to focus on this fight and on my schoolwork first.  I need to focus on my schoolwork because this weekend will be critical in my preparation for the SAT test.  My co-worker Paul is taking the ACT to LSAT prep and also took the ACT to get into the SPRINT program.

She wanted to put it in a safe place so that  it wouldn't be misused.  As soon  as we receive the money we will send it to her.  Unfortunately, the place she  wanted to send the check to was in disarray due to the fire.  She was calling the store owner to get the address of the depository.  Unfortunately, the owner was out of the office  today so we had to send the check directly to his office.  It is his sincere pleasure.

Unfortunately, this is not an item on  the hotlist so he is  unable to make the call right now.  He may want to go to Woodbury  today and beg them to expedite the matter.

I have urgent and  business-like business proposal for you. On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Department of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds in a bank here in Nigeria so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be kept aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:megan_zuba01@yahoo.com Thanks and my regards. Dr.Mohammed Zuba\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: CONFIDENTIAL\nDear MOHAMMED  ZUBA:\n\nThank you very much for the quick response. I had a  chance to catch up with him afterwards and he  told me that he had accepted the offer and would be sending the contract  along shortly. So we went our separate ways. It was very emotional  for me to hear about her death.  How could it be  that bad?  How could my son have  lost so much love and trust?  \n\nIt is very upsetting to hear the news.  My thoughts and prayers are with your family and  the people of Nigeria at this time.  It is very hard to believe  that this is the kind of country we want to leave  and come back to.  My thoughts and prayers are for your family and  the people of Nigeria at this time.  I want to  go to school in Lagos and am looking for a way to get  myself and my son into a good university.  My efforts are not in vain.  We can and will succeed and be  very happy together.  I will take a couple of days off to visit your family and  then we will be back on Monday.  Hope you can forgive me for  not being able to get back to you with the results of the  tests I have had ordered.  I have notified the  insurance company regarding this issue and they will help  you as best they can.  You have been wonderful. I am very thankful  and very appreciative.

I have urgent and  business-like business proposal for you. On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Department of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds in a bank here in Nigeria so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be kept aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:megan_zuba01@yahoo.com Thanks and my regards.

This process of trying to understand has been great.  We have a team of seven people in a building for three full days straight.  This is a lot to take in, but we have to start from scratch.  We are trying to decide what our strategy will be at this stage.  I would be happy to answer your questions, but I need this information ASAP so I can continue to work on this strategy and on developing our relationship.

Her brother was supposed to be there, but she had to go.  On Sunday we went to the Oktoberfest and my wife got to be the butt of several jokes.  Our son had a football game and the kids were so excited that they got to spend the night with their fathers.... It was so wrong when it didn't go our way.\n\nBut mostly it was painful.  Because I have not been to visit my family in a few weeks, I decided it was time to call my sister-in-law and inquire about a business meeting she was planning.  She was supposed to give me a call on Monday, but now it looks like I might have to meet with her face-to-face.  I will try and call again on Friday to make sure all is well.\n\nWe will, of course, discuss what kind of meeting we would like to have with my family, but I wanted to first talk to my family before I made a decision.  Being a part of a dual-income family, I do not have very good insurance coverage.  My wife has had it with regards to our oldest child (aged 6), but we have settled for having one child (a son aged 7) and raising him as our only child.  It is not a problem that we have, though, because we still live in a two bedroom apartment and have an accessible car.  We are trying to figure out how to build equity within our family without resorting to child support.  We are still paying off the student loans that our eldest child took on, as well as our oldest son's medical school loan.  Fortunately our oldest son is not nearly as dependent on student loans as he was at age 15, and we have been making some fairly decent monthly deposits into our son's account.  We have also added in a couple of lines of credit, one with a term of one year and the other that is term-only.  While these are not ideal, they work well in the short term to try to build some equity in our family.\n\nWe will be in the office on Wednesday for a conference call regarding our student loan.  If you are available to help us with this, please call me asap and I will hook you in!  I will also be out on Thursday for the Memorial Day weekend.

Though I knew all along that this money would be a source of stress and confusion for both of us because I have dealt with these people myself. I am a businessman by training and my business has flowered in the last ten years. My client, late Mr. Al Nasser, an Iraqi refugee ,officially became a citizen of Iraq through the action of a United Nations aid worker, and was a contractor with one of the government parastatals. He was until his death a ingress and egress through Iraq to China. Before his death he called me and informed me that he lodged some money with a security firm in DAKAR the total sum of USD$10 Million (Ten Million United States Dollars)in a box as a family treasure.When war erupted between the Iraqi Government and the United States of America in the wake of the change of the US President involving the participation of some Western military personnel in the removal of Saddam Hussein from office in Iraq.We were ordered by the president to  leave the country within seven days of the instruction. I was under the impression that such instructions came from above, however I found out that such orders were given only to government officials and that there was no such undertaking as 'captured government funds' as the funds were lodged in a security and finance firm with the help of an Iraqi Diplomatic Courier Service - an arm of the government parastatals.The funds were realized from the sale of Iraqi State Assets and the military budget during the war. I contacted you based on trust to assist me in claiming and investing these funds on your behalf with your help in processing the payments and in the business of investment in your country which is a high yielding investment. Specifically, I want you to assist in investing the money in your country to a business enterprise of sufficient size for at least two years. I will guide and assist you in all aspects of the transaction, from the time of when the funds were lodged to the time when you receive the funds. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to work with me, you should state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me immediately on my private TEL:+31 617 899 9976,so that we can proceed with the process of investing the money.I expect your urgent response.Please, call me on my private TEL:+31 617 899 1120.

We have always said that we would not build the proposed $200 million dollar building (the tallest building in Houston) unless we had first made a decision about the $50 million dollar building (the smallest).  I would like to discuss with you asap ASAP how we would make that decision.  It needs to be 100% certain that we would not be in violation of the Houston Compromise or the State of Texas Climate Change Program.  I'd like to discuss asap with your group as we are in the midst of developing the EIR, which will be submitted to the full EPA by the ALAMO DEVELOPMENT GROUP this week.  Once the decision is made on the EPA request, we will take another look at the request and, if necessary, amend it.  Once the revised request is approved, we will send the new revised request to the full EPA and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  Then, we will take another look at the revised request and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  It's important to us that Houston is developing capacity and that the EPA is monitoring this request closely.  The revised request does not do enough to tell us when it will be time to close this deal.  The new deal the EPA is negotiating requires additional information to complete the 60 days since the last deal was signed.  The EPA has informed us that the next step is to fax all of the information we received from the previous deal to the EPA for inclusion in the final product.  This would mean that by the EPA deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, we would have missed the deadline by a total of 60 days.  I was disappointed in this latest attempt to close the deal, as it was very vague and the terms were very restrictive.  I would like to discuss with you ASAP on how we would fill out the gaps in your group's schedule and, if needed, add on another day or two to keep this project on schedule.  My schedule is very flexible and AP starts on Wednesday, so I would like to get this in before the big monster on my schedule and see if the kids can come to us any of it.

Though I knew all along that this money would be a source of stress and confusion for both of us because I have dealt with these people myself. I am a businessman by training and my business has flowered in the last ten years. My client, late Mr. Al Nasser, an Iraqi refugee ,officially became a citizen of Iraq through the action of a United Nations aid worker, and was a contractor with one of the government parastatals. He was until his death a ingress and egress through Iraq to China. Before his death he called me and informed me that he lodged some money with a security firm in DAKAR the total sum of USD$10 Million (Ten Million United States Dollars)in a box as a family treasure.When war erupted between the Iraqi Government and the United States of America in the wake of the change of the US President involving the participation of some Western military personnel in the removal of Saddam Hussein from office in Iraq.We were ordered by the president to  leave the country within seven days of the instruction. I was under the impression that such instructions came from above, however I found out that such orders were given only to government officials and that there was no such undertaking as 'captured government funds' as the funds were lodged in a security and finance firm with the help of an Iraqi Diplomatic Courier Service - an arm of the government parastatals.The funds were realized from the sale of Iraqi State Assets and the military budget during the war. I contacted you based on trust to assist me in claiming and investing these funds on your behalf with your help in processing the payments and in the business of investment in your country which is a high yielding investment. Specifically, I want you to assist in investing the money in your country to a business enterprise of sufficient size for at least two years. I will guide and assist you in all aspects of the transaction, from the time of when the funds were lodged to the time when you receive the funds. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to work with me, you should state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me immediately on my private TEL:+31 617 899 9976,so that we can proceed with the process of investing the money.I expect your urgent response.Please, call me on my private TEL:+31 617 899 1120.

This fund was a residue from the over invoiced contract bills awarded by the Federal Ministry of Air Transport in favour of Al Nasser &amp; Associates in the aircraft and this is the product of over invoiced contract funds. In order to transfer this fund out of Nigeria for investment purposes. You will be required to provide a reliable and reputable business and financial investment in your country.

Your able co-operation is to become my business partner in your country and create ideas on how money will be invested, properly managed and the type of investment after the money is transferred to your custody with your help and assistance. Meanwhile, on indication of your willingness to handle this transaction sincerely by protecting our interests and upon your acceptance of this proposal, I would furnish you with the full detailed information, procedure, amount involve and mutually agree on your percentage interest or share holding for helping me to secure the release of the deposit and investing the money in your country under your proper management and care. I shall be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you so desire, but do urge you to give the matter your immediate attention it deserves.

You should expect to hear from me on Monday.  If you have a call by then, please let me know.  I am taking a vacation from work commencing January 3rd.  My son has decided to take his first vacation ever.  I will be out of the loop from Monday to Thursday.  Sounds as though his school year is fairly new and much less stressful than his last year at alma.  We only have one car though.  \n\nI just returned from a trip to Italy as that is where my son is now and we only have one child to take to school (kiddo is six months old).  Our trip was completely on hold because of a medical emergency two weeks ago.  I am so glad that your son called 2 weeks ago and said that he is interested in going to the doctor.  He said that he wants to see if there are any  other doctors or other programs that are  available that will help him.  I have to admit that I have been pretty much keeping quiet about my son's medical needs.  I have been out of the loop on a family basis as our nieces are having their  children diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone  fracture.  We are without power for about a week now and were without it for about two months because of a power outage.  My wife has recently started getting some health reports and has determined that our son is definitely on his parents  insurance and should receive some sort of compensation.  She says that his premium has increased by $100 since our last  insurance payment and we are raising children together and it is tough  to keep up with the monthly payment.  We are doing OK on the insurance front.  My oldest son just turned 19 and is in his senior year at  Southern Methodist University.  He is now the target of a new hate crime targeting Jewish people.  Our first act as mayor of  Dallas is going to be to put an end to the constant  demonstrations that are taking place all over the city.

ATTn,\nDear Mr. Michael Gallagher:\n\nI need immediate assistance with an urgent matter. The principal at the school I work for has threatened my safety if I don't cooperate with his demand that I turn over my hard drive. He said that he will \"find a way\" to get my hard drive but I don't know how or how dangerous it is becoming. I have received a lot of threatening phone calls and telegrams regarding this issue. I have been called a terrorist, a Nazi, a pervert, a child molester and a slumlord. I have been the victim of several attempts to rape me, but I have prevailed in every attempt and have overcome them all. I would like to suggest that you set up a meeting for one or two minutes to exchange views on ways to resolve this problem. I have never been violent or a threat to anyone, but I am a peaceful person who wants to cooperate with everyone and to live my life to the fullest. If you feel that I'm not cooperating and would be a menace to everyone else, then you need to tell me. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. If you don't have time to meet today, then please don't try to bully me into it. If you insist, then I need you to propose something concrete that you think I can do. I need concrete evidence that you think I'm not cooperative and there will be consequences. If you don't have that, I need evidence that you think I'm dishonest and that you think I'm a threat to other people. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. There's no time to lose.

I am Mr.David Grae, currently Director of Private Banking Services with a Bank in Singapore. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an American miner, Mr. Dave Graham made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for fourteen (14) calendar months, valued at US$14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, United Mine Workers United States that Mr.Dave Graham died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dave Graham did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of $14,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.

My son is five and a half and she is expecting his twentieth child on June the 1st. My work is very demanding and requires me to be available for every call and meeting with clients. I cannot leave the house at night due to my commitments, so I need to be available to meet with clients immediately. I cannot begin to fathom the demands placed on me by clients, parents, and siblings alike. At times, it is overwhelming. I have lost count of the number of times I have cried, wailed, or yelled at my computer screen, for no apparent reason other than stress. At other times, it has been the opposite; I have found solace in the fact that I have been called upon to care for ailing siblings, or to look after a sick parent. Simply put, I have been called upon to do both jobs. What has prevented me from doing these jobs fully, and what exactly do I lose out on if my obligations are not fulfilled?\n\nI do not want my two older siblings to have to see me do these jobs, and I do not want them to have to suffer the humiliation of having to look after their parents during times of sickness. I want them to have a better life, not only financially, but also in life. I want them to have the opportunities and the freedom to make mistakes and to grow. I do not want them to be victims, I want them to be leaders in their fields. Not only that, I want them to be able to help me and my family as they did in the past.

I was referred to you by Betty Cox, MD, FACCS.  I have been accepted into Tulane University School of Pharmacy where I will be working towards my Pharmacy degree in the spring of 1997.  I will be completing my program in the fall and will be leaving in the fall, so I have time to start working on my Master's in Clinical Pharmacy.  I have started my first semester  with the same professor as my predecessor.  We have very similar grading and grading criteria, so I am  assuming that you were not the only one who felt that you were not fitting in here.   Your name is not on the honor roll any longer, but I  think you deserve an award for your efforts.  I hope you can continue to help in any way that you can.   Also, I would like to inform you that I am no longer working for Western Union and am now working for Mastercard.  If you were wondering why  we are  not using Western Union for international transfers, now you know why.  You will get  very cold feet if you bring money here.  You have no idea how much it has cost us over the phone over the past couple of months.  We are very conservative people, and  sometimes that means we have to pinch ourselves because we don't have a lot of other options.   I was very upset about not having received an answer before Christmas.   I thought it would be a good time to ask you why you were  not using Western Union for those transactions.  Also, I was not sure if I would be able to participate in some of the activities  that you had planned for the trip because I was working part-time  and had to look for a job.   You must have heard, or seen, that I was able to join  something called The Tulane Alumni Foundation.   This is a non-profit corporation that raises money for both schools and gives  back to the community in some small  way.   My hope is that we can help in the search for a cure  for some  common  disease or a way to keep people on a little more  realistic  economic  expenses.

Dear (Sherry) I fear that my appeal to you might be a sullen one, though I know that a parent ought not to cry out their child's name. I am Sarah Amaka ,the son of late former PRESIDENT of (UN* - South African)Victor Hugo Amakuma (Aza a.k.a Josef) and on the 15th of May 2003, during a coup against the elected government of my country, my father died along with my mother. Since then my mother left with her children (stuck) for (UNHCR in South Africa) Africa. I have decided to contact you because of the urgency of this transaction. My father was a shopper and he was also a diamond /cocoa dealer in Liberia. Before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some money (US$10.000.000.00) which he made on a business trip to (South Africa) through a diplomatic means, with a security company here in South Africa. He told me that this money was to enable him invest a good part of his life in your country. I want you to help me to lodge this consignment in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box and then forward it to you for safe keeping. He told me that the security company did not know the content of the box as it was unloaded and left at my disposal with the help of my husband's former assistant. This consignment has since been lodged in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box. However, the management at the Security Company told me that they did not know the content of the box as it was left there as a family treasure. They told me that the box will be opened upon request from me at the last. When I tried to contact my late father's attorney in South Africa, he told me that he had all the necessary legal documents which prove the validity of the consignment. I am waiting for your urgent response.

Is there anyway I can go to the SEC prosecutor about making an  official request to bury my parents, and he's got an urgent case.   Is there anyway I can go to the  SEC prosecutor about wanting to be buried with my grandchild.   I have been living in New York for the past 8 months, and have moved back to L.A. two weeks ago.   I've decided to move back to L.A. with my wife and our three children as our first stopover.   I'll be out of the country for the rest of the summer, so I can't send my request to  the SEC for investigation.  Unfortunately, I don't have that much time remaining on my contract, so I can't request an immediate  pardon.  Even if I were an adult and could request a discretionary pardon, it would be very difficult to justify in writing.  It just would be a matter of  showing cause  and justifying my actions.  I can't do either of those things, unfortunately.   So, I am basically putting the legal fight I am having with the SEC behind me now.   I would love to be able to share with you  what I have learned about the SEC and what I can do to make your life easier.\n\nBut first, I want to talk to you about some funeral arrangements. I have some questions for you that I  have not been able to sort out yet.  You guys and I talked earlier about wanting to  take time during the week of February 4th to sort out the arrangements for your and your family's funeral.  I have narrowed down my list of  requests to three.   They are the most reasonable and I feel that if you guys could agree on  these terms, it would be a huge relief  to me and to everyone involved.   Will your forgiveness  be enough to keep me going?  My prayers are with you during this difficult time.\n\nLove, Dad\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: SARAH AMAKA\nTitle: URGENT ASSISTANCE .\n URGENT ASSISTANCE .

I want you to help me to lodge this consignment in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box and then forward it to you for safe keeping. He told me that the security company did not know the content of the box as it was unloaded and left at my disposal with the help of my husband's former assistant. This consignment has since been lodged in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box. However, the management at the Security Company told me that they did not know the content of the box as it was left there as a family treasure. They told me that the box will be opened upon request from me at the last. When I tried to contact my late father's attorney in South Africa, he told me that he had all the necessary legal documents which prove the validity of the consignment. I am waiting for your urgent response.

My older son (retired) and an upperclassman from another university came here on February 13. They took the Saturday visit and I spent the rest of the weekend with them. It was a really good experience and I would recommend it to anyone considering coming. My priority at this time is getting my daughter an advanced education. An A.A. is very exciting but also very intimidating. My oldest son (retired) is now an academic and started at the university as a freshman. The A.A. program allows him to continue his education while still having an active and contributing role in his family.  As for his younger son, he is studying to become a . He is currently on an accelerated three year path.   After completing his program, he will be entering the same position that he was in as a student at the university.  He hopes to one day work for  Enron and become a part of history.   My apologies for any of you that are  experiencing this right now.

On June 6, 1998, an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an entire portfolio valued at US$19,500,000.00 (Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into one of the leading private Banks here in South Africa.

Yours faithfully, Mr. Arif Shaikh\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Attention/ Ceo/Concerns\nDear Mr. Arif Shaikh:\n,\n For the record, I have your wife's address and we (Ms. Arif and I) moved into an apartment complex about 3.5 hours north of my house on Tuesday, September 20.  I thought that you might be interested in our rental agreement. Apparently, Ms. Arif and her family moved here from Saudi Arabia about a year ago.  My wife and I (Ms. Arif and I) were originally from Egypt and we moved here about a year ago.  We're originally from California but our area codes are actually pretty minor so we originally thought that we were moving to Southern California.  But Ms. Arif is originally from Saudi Arabia and our area codes are really big so we originally thought that she was going to California.  And she is originally from Utah so our area codes are actually pretty big too.  So, I guess her new area code is a big deal because her new home is located in an area where CA does not have enough power for its population density to support an independent power plant.  We originally planned on starting up the plant back in September but Ms. Arif's visa condition (you heard me right) called for us to wait until January 2, which was absolutely unthinkable because the plant would be operational back then.  Finally, Ms. Arif's visa called for us to put the plant up for auction which was completely out of the question because Ms. Arif is a citizen of a different country and our country doesn't recognize her new nationality.  We finally put the plant up for auction last week so that's why Ms. Arif is in the situation she is in (a crappy one, actually, but that's another story).  Anyway, she is technically our subleasee but she is really our landlord (he bought the unit from us 6 months ago).\n Ms. Arif seems to be living in a one-bedroom apartment on $600 per month (estimate).  We finally sold our last sublet and moved into a one-bed flat on $900 per month (a full month's rent for a one bedroom apartment complex).  We originally thought that maybe we could negotiate a little better sublet if we offered her some equity in exchange for the right to keep her on the lease (which we could have done if we had offered her some cash).  Maybe we could have offered some sort of equity loan (like a down payment schedule that she can't prepay downshift into) or some sort of loan insurance", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr. Arif Shaikh\nTitle: Attention/ Ceo/Concerns\n Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Attention/ Ceo/Concerns Dear Sir/ Madam, I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, Deputy Chief Credit &amp; Risk Officer of a reputable bank in South Africa who specialises in repurchasing and restructuring outstanding securities.

Yours faithfully, Dean Osala\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: ASSIST ME PLEASE\nDear Dean  Osala:\n \n \n \n \n I need urgent help with an old project that is very complicated and involves a trip to L.A. for two weeks. I was referred to you by a friend who is an attorney and an expert in the area of corporate training. She is able to interpret your reply as though it were legal advice, which is why she recommended you over other candidates. \n   \n Unfortunately, her advanced age and the fact that this is her second attempt at a corporate training project means that she will receive much less legal advice on this subject matter. \n  \n Your friend believes that you should use your skill set to help her gain a competitive edge in this area.   To this end, she has suggested that you should participate in an Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP).   This is a program that gives employees the opportunity to purchase the stock of their choosing and in return receive equal or greater influence in the decision making process.  This program is very different from the traditional business strategy that is typically employed.   It is based on the concept of \"assumed control\", which is the opposite of \"controlling\".   It is the antithesis of the classic managing-by-committee approach.   It is the opposite of collaborative thinking and is very difficult to sustain over time.   The key to sustain this approach, as with many aspects of business, is a skill set and a commitment to keep improving each and every day.   You need to show your skills and be committed to continuing to improve them.   This is why it is so important that you show yourself to be an active part of the process and positively contributing member of the solution.  \n  \n I do appreciate the concern for your son and the concerns that other parents may have.  The reality is that as of today, my son is in the most advanced stages of cancer care and treatment and I do not want him to continue living a life of dependency and pain.  I want him to continue living his life in the way that is most comfortable for him and his family.   Since his parents separated, I have spent a great deal of time with my son and I am deeply committed to making sure that he has the best possible start in life.   My goal is to help him realize his full potential and I want him to look to me for direction in the beginning stages of his journey.

I am contacting you concerning a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account in our Bank. The said money was a result of a contract awarded by the bank for the goods and services supplied by the bank during the year 2004. The contract was supposed to the construction of a new steel plant in China and the actual cost of the project was over invoiced to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars).

He and his family emigrated from Ethiopia to the United States in the 80's. Their oldest son is an attorney in the Seattle area and they have one daughter  who is 15 years old. They came to this country legally and immigrated with their spouses and children. Their grandchild is an infant and they are trying to get a stay on her visa so she can come to this country legally. This is not a time sensitive process so it is urgent that we get this done as soon as possible.\n \n My response to you is based on extensive conversations I have had with my US counterparts and my own extensive reading of the INA.  It is clear to me that your priorities are completely different; your Department is focused on cases that are pending and you do not have time to process as many applications as I do.  I appreciate that you are trying to help but my response is based on very limited data and will be based on your discussions with our US counterparts and my own review of the data.\n \n Please set a time frame that you will begin to accomplish based on data available to me at this time.  Otherwise my response will simply be based on my desire to help you and my desire to communicate with you in a manner that is both legal and expedient.  It is important to me that you begin the negotiation process with us ASAP so that we can have a better insight into your priorities.\n \n If you wish to meet with me in person regarding this issue I would need to meet with you in the next few weeks to fully understand what your priority is and how we should approach this.  I would need to provide you with specific details regarding my status as we have no current meetings scheduled with our UK counterparts and I do not anticipate having time to travel to discuss this in person due to an upcoming divorce.    Also, my expectation would be that your priority be to resolve the US$12 million question since we paid this in June and it appears that the court will be very conservative with this amount.   I would need to provide specific details regarding my efforts in drafting the draft treaty with the US to ensure that we are not complicit in the illegal activities of the US and their allies.   Lastly, I would need detailed data regarding my efforts to ensure that the information presented to the US is accurate and complete.

I am a Director of the Bank of the African Development Bank Cape Town South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant, i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with my government attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Unfortunately, our (probably short) time line on this transaction is very short.  You have been referred to me by an Intereoretty broker-dealer who is very promising and has excellent relationships with a number of international financial institutions.  Our goal is to convince  these folks that we can deliver on our time  line.  Unfortunately, our time line is very long.   In fact, our time  line is much shorter than the one-year deadline.   We have started negotiating with these folks and we intend to move  this process along very quickly.   This process should be completed by the end of the  first week of June.   However, due to the urgency of this transaction, certain co-ordinates and information has been  lost due to the transition.  To return to our original time line, we need your comments and  suggestions on how we can make this process flow in a less  intensive manner.  It is my hope that the more immediate concerns can be mitigated or  eliminated in the interim.   As we have discussed, I would like to keep the original 1/2 mile time line  with an urgent revision to it.   This revision needs to be in place no later than June 2013.   This way, we get our wish granted and we still have  some flexibility in the event that we lose money.   An urgent revision to the settlement we have already made with the ADEA would  be in order before June.     However, due to the urgency of this transaction, I have to propose to  you today and you have until Monday to make your decision.   If you decide to accept the revision to the settlement,  then you will have until early July to approve the revised agreement.      If, on the other hand, you decide to reject the proposed changes, then you will  have until August to do so.    The proposed revisions to the settlement should be in place no sooner  than August 13.     This way, we avoid any \"ifs\" and \"buts\" about the  appropriate timeline.      I hope you and your family are doing well.  I will contact you shortly  with further information regarding the Hebert Report.    - Dan  x3-0977      \n\n-----Original Message-----  From", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: TOM MORGAN\nTitle: Urgent  Business Proposal\n Urgent  Business Proposal COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.

Jones, deputy senior regional manager of SEZ Bank Plc, Johannesburg, South Africa. I became aware of the existence of this fund in a safe-deposit box kept by my branch manager at the end of May 2001. The box was opened and the contents of the box lost. Since we have not known the contents of the box since then, we assumed it was lost by accident. After due deliberation with my colleagues, we decided to leave the fund worldwide for safe keeping in a secluded area as I will arrange for us to resume our business relationship when the fund has been in there for a long time. I have therefore, sought your assistance in the transfer of the fund to your account. I have the authority of my manager and two other top officials to request that you should present your self as the beneficiary to the fund to enable us transfer into your account the fund 30% of the total sum. You should furnish me immediately with your phone number,firm's name or any alias so that I can use your confidential telephone and fax number to conduct the necessary procedures. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, I hope this is the right decision for you. Please, I appreciate the urgency of this transaction.

Your urgent response to this crisis is critical given the serious \n questions we are asking ourselves right now.  How did this massive energy problem start?  Why do we keep getting asked \"Why?\", \n\nPlease help resolve this energy crisis for the people of California by publicly stating \n that the $700 million figure is not an accurate representation of the true cost of these major \n errors.  The $350 million figure is the most recent and excludes the $50 million overruns which most widely accepted as \n a cost in the industry.  There is simply no comparison.  The SEC has grossly understated the cost \n incurred by PG&E and its subsidiaries in southern California to maintain these contracts and to \n which they are entitled.  It is unacceptable that my office should be considered a hub \n for investigation or prosecution of these errors.  This is clearly a business problem, \n not a health problem.  \n\nRegards,\n\nJones Anglin\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr. Iwan R. Jones\nTitle: Attention/ Urgent(for emergency)\n Attention/ Urgent(for emergency) Attention/ Urgent(for emergency) My Dear Friend, I am Mr. Iwan R. Jones, deputy senior regional manager of SEZ Bank Plc, Johannesburg, South Africa. I became aware of the existence of this fund in a safe-deposit box kept by my branch manager at the end of May 2001. The box was opened and the contents of the box lost. Since we have not known the contents of the box since then, we assumed it was lost by accident. After due deliberation with my colleagues, we decided to leave the fund worldwide for safe keeping in a secluded area as I will arrange for us to resume our business relationship when the fund has been in there for a long time. I have therefore, sought your assistance in the transfer of the fund to your account. I have the authority of my manager and two other top officials to request that you should present your self as the beneficiary to the fund to enable us transfer into your account the fund 30% of the total sum. You should furnish me immediately with your phone number,firm's name or any alias so that I can use your confidential telephone and fax number to conduct the necessary procedures. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, I hope this is the right decision for you. Please, I appreciate the urgency of this transaction. I will like to assure you that there is no risk attached. I am waiting for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Dr. Iwan R.

During my husband's time in the office, he was also in-charge of the payment of the military salary during his life service time . During my husband's tenure as the leader of the Gulf War, I witnessed many of the atrocities committed by the rebels and many others. During my husband's time in the office, I learnt that some of the money that my late husband deposited in a security company during the war was not actually the total amount involved, but a portion that was meant for my son's future investment in your country or anywhere else in the world. After going through some of the records, I noticed that some of the documents that was deposited in the security company belong to my late husband. After going through the records, I discovered that my late husband did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the bank. This amount of US$9.9M (Nine million United States dollars) was actually Deposited in the bank as family valuables, and the authorisation papers for this deposit were signed by my late husband's family attorney and approved by the bank board before the funds were finally released. In order to avoid any family relation from being affected by the release of the funds, I will write to- some of the family relations who will be interested in this transaction are as follows; [1] Mr. Daniel  Hosseini [2] Mr Shoaib al-Hashemi [3] Mr Nasser al-Hashemi [4] From  Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi.

The problem is that our lawyer has advised that since we sent the money to the plan, they need to get what is legally required before they can consider the claim. He said that they need to talk with my co-worker (our HR Director) about getting the necessary info from me. My goal is to make sure that the lawyer is on our side ASAP so we can move to the filing and billing phase.\n\nPlease advise on how to proceed ..... It is quite simple actually ..... Get me the contact info for my former employer that is outside of the United States (our major rival).  Find out their legal tender exchange rate so that we can get some ballpark figures. I need to talk with my former boss (United Services Exchange) about setting up a meeting with them so that we can get a better feel for their currency rate.\n\nThanks, muye\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: muyeke\nTitle: Good day my Dear\n Good day my Dear  Dear my dear    Madagascar specifically.

Please review this, if it is not in effect please return immediately and we will resubmit  this as agreement at a later date.  This is a case in point, as we discussed extending the deadline to Dec. 1 to March 31 which is very problematic becasue its in effect  until the 1st of December.  This is not a situation where we have ``to do this, they do that, why shouldn't we make the rules retroactive to give them a fighting chance at the  fee schedule they chose,'' etc.  Simply by signing this document, both sides have committed  to doing business in accordance with the non-compete clause of the agreement.  This provision is very clear and  positive in nature and is intended to encourage free  exchange of ideas and information.  The counter parties intention was clearly to  quash any attempt at a settlement that does not include this provision.  This is a huge win for the  parties, and i am sure many others as well.  This is a big win for us as the longer we wait to resolve this the  more it will cost us in lost business and frustration.  I was right there with  you when you first identified this issue.  I can't remember exactly where, but from what i can gather we wanted to  avoid arbitration at all costs.  This is a significant win for consumers,  and i think for everybody involved.  The non-aggression pact  was going to be a big win for consumers since they would be able to choose their  provider of  energy, and it is a major factor in their economics.  By striking the non-aggression pact they  agreed to not use force if necessary to resolve disputes, and they also committed  to working towards a  settlement that promotes the free exchange of ideas and information.  This may be their biggest win yet, and if  things don't go their way i would go to war with them.  As it is currently  contemplated they will make a payment to Alamo in March and its  implications on our position in light of the non-aggression pact.  Its hard to believe, but  it was actually the other party that struck the non-aggression pact  and they really had nothing to gain or lose by not doing so.

The contract was supposed to be settled in your favor but now that I and some of my colleagues are here on leave leaving for a business trip to the USA we determined to transfer the fund to a foreign account. We intend to invest the fund in any profitable business in your country with your assistance.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved in the award and review and the relevant document covering the award and review is with my colleague involved in the purchase. Now that I am here, we want to establish a joint business investment in your country with you as our foreign partner.  What we want from you is (1) a country, (2) a reliable and suitable location (3) a good remuneration (4) a share bequeing to you as soon as the fund reaches your custody.  If you accept to work with us, the following requirements must be met: (1) We must have both an open end of contract and a closed end of contract (2) the contract must be of a timely nature (3) the remuneration must be reasonable (4) both parties must be adequately rested at the end of the transaction. The transaction will be successfully concluded within 10 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation if you should provide a satisfactory account where the fund will be remitted to you. If you are interested, contact me for further discussion and discussion. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately so that we can discuss the modalities of your business partnership. I await for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Dr. Ibrahim Quattara\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM:DR.IHADQUATTARA\nDear Dr. Ibrahim Quattara:\n\nI have been out of the office and have just seen what I believe to be a mistake on your end regarding the email you sent my way.   Apologetically, I was not in charge of delivering the email to you, as I had instructed my assistant to do.  However, I was able to retrieve it after your assistant had sent it back to me.   Please respond ASAP to this clarification so that I am not held to a higher standard.   Once I have had a chance to look at the attached data sheet with a little more understanding, I would think that we could work out a reasonable basis for a claim against GM, as I have discussed with Adrian last week.   This claim would have to meet both of my pre-negotiations for her to even consider accepting the letter.   Not to mention, there is ancillary service that GM provides to the insurance companies that pays for the  premiums that other companies are paying for the claims that are being made against them.   The additional detail I gave you is just to hammer home how little understanding I have for the  claim and have you consider the additional information I would need to provide to support a claim that  is quite possibly the most egregious example of entitlement around.   I need to send this out this afternoon, so I need  to get it to a place in memory for Ken and Susan.   Thanks for your help.   -----Original Message----- From: \tIbid.pdf  \n\n\"Acknowledgements\" <earl.strudwick@wfsg.com> on 03/17/2000 02:02:32 PM To:\ufffdIbid.doc, Eddie A Collins/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:DeliveryDateIbid.doc Subject:\tRE: Re-Held Contract\n\nThis is great.

I would suggest reducing the recipe to one cup (approximately one teaspoon) of table salt.\n\nOf course, the recipe is not meant to be a substitute for the medical care that you and your family receive, but I would still recommend taking it slow and seeing if there is any way to reduce the amount of time needed until you are done.  If there is, by all means, increase the time and cook until tender.\n\nPlease note that this is not a substitute for the full range of medical care that you and your family receive, nor is it intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.

I tried to give you an update on my  situation.   I have a conference call with this gentleman and his assistant on   Thursday.   I hope you were not  too  surprised to learn that my youngest child is engaged to be married   on September 20.  That would mean that my engagement is over September and the search for our   engagement ring will start September 25.   I was hoping that you could at least give me some update on what is holding  up our engagement ring deal.   Most recently, our engagement ring deal with the big 6 met with a major revamp.   I was not too thrilled with the new take on things, but it  looks like we are still on the right track.   I know that you were  very upset with me for taking the ring on this trip.   You wrote to me that  \"you were going to give the ring to  Mom\" and I responded that \"even if it costs $50,000,  I need it now.\"   Your tone was very  different that day than it would be a couple of weeks  later.   I want to  remind you how serious of a person I am.  I am not going to lie and tell you that I am not upset about the money.   I certainly wouldn't want to do  something stupid like that again.   I love you and you have always done a great job of supporting me.   Would it be appropriate to assume that we will be getting along fine in this relationship?   I cannot believe the out pour of help  that came my way.   My load has been lifted considerably, but I have not really felt the rush of emotions like you did.   I have a lot of unanswered questions that I want you to answer for me, but I also want you to know that we are still very different people.   I would like to get to the bottom of exactly what steps I have to take to get exactly what I want,  and I don't want to do that by beating around the bush for you.   I was hoping that we could work out an amicable way to split the money and get it  remitted to me by the time you get this letter.   As it is right now, I just want to work out an exit strategy to use if we don't make a decision", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mrs.Rita Diatta.\nTitle: Urgent  Proposal\n Urgent  Proposal &gt;From: Miss.Rita Diatta.

UK. 34-1-841-2207. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you in respect of United Bank for Africa (UBA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.  On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Taylor made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. David Taylor died from a car accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Taylor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank.

UK. 34-1-841-2207. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you in respect of United Bank for Africa (UBA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.  On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Taylor made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. David Taylor died from a car accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Taylor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the remaining 20% is for each beneficiary,whichever is greater. If you are interested,please reply immediately to my private and confidential fax number as above. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

This includes any effort to try and build a settlement with the sticking point 1.44.  This is a huge disappointment to our discussions earlier this year, when it seemed like there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.  We knew that negotiations were in very poor shape, and it appeared as if there might even be a lack of agreement.   I wanted to be sure you were aware of this and took the unusual step of writing to you on Friday, to gauge your reaction.  I knew you would be upset about Adams leaving, but I wanted to be sure this wasn't misinterpreted as a parting gift.   Thanks so much.  It's good to hear from you.  How's work? Where are you? Do you live in a house with other engineers?  We need to bring him home ASAP so he can get some distance from home.   I'll write again on Monday to bring you up to date.    P.S. If there's anything I can do to help you cope with this loss, just ask.  It's been quite a journey.  I'm sure your son will be just as upset about this as I was.  It's been quite a journey because of course he will be.  We will be reunited as Christians, but I'm not sure he will be ready for it.  I need to start this week on top, so that's the plan.  You have my prayers for a speedy recovery.

I was going down to LA on June 10 and 11, and then on Friday June 13 I'm going to take the boys to school in SoDo, and then back on Sunday June 15. Landon is having lunch with his coach and I was going to take the girls to the locker room for lunch. But I didn't  choose to do either because it would have violated the rest of our  schedule. Also, I just found out today that my wife is expecting our first child  and we're planning on having another one shortly. So I can't get any time off the calendar.  I guess we'll just have to put the plan in motion  now that we have a few new additions to the family. I'll still be in  LA on Monday, though. I just wanted to be sure we were both on the same  calendar.  Please advise ASAP on what you and the boys want to do about soccer practice.  The girls just got  permission to play on the first team.  I plan on attending with my son.  Does that mean I can't take the boys to school?  I thought they were supposed to begin practicing on Monday  A.M.?\n\nMR.

Yours faithfully, Mr. Peter Clark\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: PRODUCT ASSISTANCE\nDear Mr. Peter Clark,\n\nI received a call today from Kent Schoenauer at Product Assurance concerning an international product we have been handling for  several months.  Mr. Schoenauer told me  that he had talked to its lead attorney and the  lead lawyer recused himself. So Mr. Schoenauer had to act  independently.  He advised me today that my options are limited and  only partially protective.  I could  sue the company,  but that would only involve naming the company  and seeking damages for the lead attorney.  The company would not be protected  by the covenant in the investment agreement.  Nor could the lead attorney receive any type of benefit  from this transaction.  The company would almost certainly suffer irreparable harm if this  were a part of a larger agreement.  Lastly, Mr. Schoenauer advised me that due diligence was required on  the part of the company and that there may be a better  way to protect investors than relying on  simple litigation.    I chose to take  this course of action because I knew it would be a part of my job  to do.   Investor relations calls like this are quite common,  and I feel that due diligence was not immediately forthcoming  from the company.    I received an unsolicited proposal from the  company on Monday.    I looked at the contract and found a number of  problems.   I informed the company that I was  going to review it on Tuesday.    On Wednesday morning, I  delivered my findings to the company's lawyer  (who is  not related to me) and on Thursday I  delivered my findings to the CEO and President (who are related to each other).    My call  with the company was  interesting.   The CEO seemed to be pretty cooperative and the  President seemed very reluctant to do  anything about it.   My conclusion  is that they need to do something about it  ASAP because it is affecting their stock price.   Their stock price has been consistently bad for several months;   it seems that they did  not want to do anything about it before the deadline.   I called several times and one of  them hung up on me.   I then tried again and again until I finally  got through to the CEO.   As a matter of fact, he still does not  seem to be very interested in doing anything about it;  he is out of the office", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr. Peter Clark\nTitle: PRODUCT ASSISTANCE \n PRODUCT ASSISTANCE  &lt;248-70-205-7700.230-70.177.24.ipcc.gov\nFrom contact of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (F.R.N).

With two full time employees and one contract employee, this would be a huge challenge.  It is also important to remember that this is an urgent project and we need this project to move along much faster than originally planned.

Your sensitive nature and limited timeframe is making these decisions difficult.  I want to avoid any possible heartbreak this Valentine's Day as we all get to really \"get\" each other.

For June 1st I will be in the Atlanta office, in case you are wondering where I am.  June 2nd will be another exciting month for me because I will be moving from the LA office to the Atlanta office so that I can be with my family on June 15th.

You said that you knew I was gay, yet you did not \"confirm\" my \"gayness\" with your friends or my superior.  Your denial is not only foolish, but it is also a disservice to the cause.
