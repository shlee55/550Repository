It may interest you as well to know that I was the account officer to  the deputy chief air traffic controller of Abuja Air Traffic Control  not far from here in Lagos who was involved in an air crash. The accident occurred on the 23rd  of April 2000. while on transit to Dakar Senegal. Below is a picture taken by my  colleague while we are on duty.

It is because of the uncertainty of knowing the real owner of the funds that the  government of Nigeria has made arrangement in the European campaign to track the fund to any of the 204 accountants that the government has told my  colleague and myself to look for any of his next of kin. Having investigated further into the matter, I found out that Mr. and Mrs. David Ingrams died without a Will but they may have left behind some of their fund with a security firm in  Europe. These funds are some of millions of dollars that have been floating around for some years now. It is not clear to me which accountants are still holding the funds for the government. I would like to know now how much of the funds remain in the account of the government and which is being controlled by me now and later in the year.

My father was the first and only Baptist pastor of our church in the city of Lagos, who died in the year 2000. Before his death on 1st September 2002, my mother died while she was giving birth to my father's second child. My father deposited the sum of $15.5million (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security company in Cotonou, Benin.After the death of my father, I went to my father's home country of Benin to seek for a reliable foreigner to stand as my guardian and next of kin to my mother. He told me that in a few days, he will re-marry with his first wife and they will both reach the age of 60. I then sought for an intercountry partner to carry out the business with me and partner abroad.As soon as I accepted his offer, I started by getting in touch with a security company and arranging the banking and financial details on how the money will be secured into an account in your name. Then I sent a copy of the contract between me and the company to your name so that you will prepare the documents and letter of application. Finally, I told you where I kept my share (50.5%) and what percentage (25%) will be for my own protection. I told you that 75% (25%) will be for you.

As the president of the A.G. now, he knows that he will get this money from time to time when he is in the country.

I then proceeded to the vault and found the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) in there with the papers of my boss. I demanded where my boss got the money from and he told me that he deposited the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) with a security company in Europe.

PLEASE URGENT RESPOND MESSAGE\nDear Smrke:\n\nAfter reviewing the information in the latest health and welfare reports, such as  I am no longer receiving these weekly reports.  I am  left here to determine who to inform for whom to contact  and who to contact for whom this health concern concerns  pertains.  It is also important to recognize that many of the health  and welfare reports from Enron were submitted by parties that do not control  all healthcare providers in their areas.    To make matters worse, health and welfare reports are still being accepted  by the Health and Environmental  Services of PHI.  I am hoping that this health care concern is not being discussed on  the committee at full committee  meetings.   Thank you for taking time out of your  busy schedules to review the latest  health and welfare reports.   Sincerely  looking forward to your report on Health  and Energy in the next few  weeks.\n\nKind regards, \n\nVince \n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Smrke\nTitle: HEALTH SUPPORT .

My name is Mr. Rene Broeksmit, currently Head of corporate affairs with a well-known multinational corporation from Holland.I got your contact through a reliable source on the internet. Prior to the seizure of my company by government forces of Republic of Liberia, my wife Lillian and I were forced to relocate to Sierra Leone where I now remain presently.  However, I have been able to successfully retrieve some funds (USD$10.5M) deposited by my company in the Federal Government of Liberia so that the total amount of US$10.5M CAN be paid to you, without any problem.

Dear Sir,              (REPLY MESSAGE)                                                CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: I am a staff in the Accountant General of African Development Bank (ADB) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

We had an account with holding balance of US$10,000,000 .00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which we intend to withdraw the sum of ($10,000,000.00) from the bank for proper disbursement. The owner of the account a foreigner by name James Anderson died since 1995.

I am prepared to enter into a joint business venture with you to claim the money and share it with me.

ARAF:      You have been recommended to me by the C.E.O. of Enron Corp., Jeffrey R. Lowney, as being an authority on banking regulation in the United States.  I was interested in learning from you and your associates (those of you who were in the    previous position) on some of the regulatory issues and    issues arising within our industry and the regulatory oversight that the C.E.O.    proposed to me in his written   testimony (see Exhibit 1 below).  I was hoping that we could discuss in greater   detail what he has suggested, and perhaps   he would be  able to informally clarify   you of what you have said.  I   therefore would request that your time be \"reached\"   on Monday, April 12th, and that you \"give me   a copy of any comments he has \n to this effect, and   I have   the opportunity to ask you during today's meeting.\"  I   think this is the right time to take some time to    review his proposed comments as they relate to the   C.E.O.   Comments are also a good time to look at the SEC   comments on his proposed   testimony. \u00a0 I  do not think we   need to rush him on this.  I agree with both you and the C.E.O. that there is a    good case to make regarding the C.E.O.'s role in setting financial   standards for investment banking operations.  We will   also discuss in greater detail with regard to his role in   regulating the   emerging  industry that has emerged since he left the Enron- \n bank.

My name is Mr. JAYSH dhuchi from Palestine, Palestine. I am the accountant general of a bank here in Palestine. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On May 12, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Government of  Iraq, Mr. Bassem Youssef who was based in Kuwait, flew to Kuwait to  visit his daughter. While in Kuwait, Mr. Bassem lodged an application for a Temporary Resident permit with the Embassy's  Office. On further investigation, it was  discovered that Mr. Bassem had no family or relations in Kuwait. The Embassy's office at the time of filing advised him of his inability to operate a  foreign account and will confiscate any such account at the expiration of 5 (five) years. The situation became more and more desperate as no other person knew about these accounts or any thing concerning them, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved it to be false. It is more than likely that this account is standing as the beneficiary of the late Mr. Basem Youssef who was a Foreign Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Iraqi Ministry of the petroleum Resources and Fuels.

I am presently undergoing trial in Lagos State of Nigeria where I am presently residing, while on trial for my role in the $10 Million Real Estate Development in my country. My late father was the general President of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN). He was in office for 4 years before he was assasinated in the corruption trial in Lagos. Being the only child of my father, I do not know what will happen to me at the end of my trials but I believe that God has a plan for this. My father was the president of the largest real estate development in the Nigeria area and he wanted to build a government owned real estate in Lagos and other important cities of Nigeria. He wanted me to look for a reliable foreign partner to assist in this project. I have the documents to back up my story and this is an accurate story. My Uncle Nelson was the former president of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN) while I was in school and he used my name as his associate in the Real Estate Development. I do not know what the circumstances of this development is at the moment but I will tell you later. As a matter of fact, I have already managed to get a government contracted company to assist me in this project. This project is based on trust so I need a reliable foreign partner to assist in this contract. As soon as this is concluded, you will be entitled to 30% of the total contract amount while the balance will be used by me to fund my future education and that of my family, if any. I would need your full cooperation to enable us achieve this project. Your position in the company will be from office of the Vice President through the President to enable us secure the necessary approvals and letter of origin from the relevant ministries for shipping to your bank. For your co-operation, you will receive 10%of the total contract amount while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that could be incurred during the process of the transaction. If this proposal is acceptable to you, feel free to reply. Yours Sincerely, Indigeta Caro. (SINCERELY,INDIGEATA CARO) N.B.

Good to hear from you and i also congratulate you on becoming the  auditor of the bill of accountancy with BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOU-BURGINA  FASO ? The auditors did a great job  as they did not hesitate in reporting about  the  bill and about the auditors or their recommendations on the bill  to the bank or even to the auditors. I  guess they also have a responsibility  to inform everyone about the  audit and especially about the reports being made  to the auditors. As you already know, i started  working  a year ago in Nigeria and Nigeria has its own  auditors (the auditors from Nigeria are on my team) and they  did  tremendous job in preparing the draft  report.  I am sure that the  other auditors would  appreciate a similar report to be made to  BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOU-BURGINA FASO. ? I can't wait for that report. ? Please, take me best  regards, ?

I am Mr. john mohameed a citizen of U.S.A. but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. I worked with a private banking group in the region for over four years. During this period, I transferred some amount of money to their accounts in Union Bank of West African and also a bank in the region. The source of this money was a contract which I executed with them. This contract called for the delivery of various supplies and services to various client in the region. The product which was finally delivered was very good and well received by all the parties involved. However, on the evening of the 22nd of April 2002, my clientele along with his entire family including his wife and children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives during the event. Since then I have been on a search for a reliable and trustworthy person who can assist me in this regard. While I was on the process of locating a relative, I discovered an account with Total sum of $10.5million (Ten million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars only) in a financial institution in Lagos and I believe you understand where this is going. The owner of this account is Mr. H. Lawrence \"Bubba\" Burns a citizen of USA, but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all was fruitless. The reason why I have not located anyone is because I have filed for political asylum with the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan. My position now as the head of state of Jordan mandates that I cannot operate an account in the USA. Consequently, the amount involved is (US$10.5million) Ten million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars only. I believe you understand where this is going.                   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm                     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm           http://www.msn.com/msn2/default.asp?rsp=M+20040721&amp;hmB=1&amp;pA=2&amp;mK=1&amp;mS=2&amp;mc=&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Hello, Mr. john mohameed,\nDear mrjohn mohameed <mohameed.mohamed@hotmail.com> on 04/11/27/2000 07:34:45          Subject:  Re: Hello,\nDear Mr. john mr.john:\nplease, hello!

I enjoyed the seminar greatly.  As I recall - it covered most of the  common but very interesting topics you   have covered this semester.  I found some  interesting essays that you have presented. \n\nHowever, as someone new to the field, the  discussion was a bit  superficial.  I want to make clear that I do not doubt your ability to   present a  good seminar. It is simply that I am very nervous about the last  time I  had a similar discussion with you.  I  had the experience several time  in the past of meeting professors with PhD programs who   were able to  present a seminar that  was informative, although it  was somewhat superficial and at times quite   superficial.  I  was hoping that I would not repeat the experience.\n\nHave a great day and best regards,\n\nYohannes G. Kampe\n\nPS.  I would love to meet you in New York if  possible.\n\nRegards,\n\nYohannes C.

PHONE: 00226-7707-7885 EMAIL:larrynittaya@myway.com Dear, Thank you for giving me your time to write. I am Mr. Larisa Nitterka, the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso-West African. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that we shall be able to trust you with the information we have here in front of us. In 1990, when I became the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso, I discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5million dollars (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family while he was on a trip to Dubai in UAE in 2000.Sometime after the death of this customer, prior to his untimely demise, this account was audited and found out to be dormant and inactive for the past 3 years running. From my investigation, I also discovered that the owner of the account Mr. Warren Davidson died without a [heir] hence the money is left in the custody of the bank.According to the Burkina-Faso laws and regulations, if such money remains dormant or inactive for more than 3 years in the charge of our bank, the money will be transferred into the custody of the government department. In order to avert this, I got your contact through a reliable and a knowledgeable person who had the information needed to execute this transaction. I have made up my mind to seek for your assistance and cooperation to enable us conclude the transfer within 14 working days of the date of this letter. If you are willing to work with me, you are expected to indicate your interest to me by giving me your direct and private telephone number and fax number, which I will provide at the time of transaction. There is no risk involved in this matter, the information we need is a legal claim to the account, which a witness will produce at the time the funds are transferred. As soon as you confirm your ability to execute this transaction, we shall furnish you with the details. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. A favorable conclusion to this matter would be appreciated. Please send your reply to my confidential email address. Mr. Larisa Nitterka\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM:MR.LARISA NITSKAYA\nDear MRS.LARISA NITSKAYA\n\nI shall send you a formal written statement of my reasons for leaving the bank in your name as I understand it.     I understand that this is only a letter and that I would need to appear in front of the judge which is why I would request that the transaction be executed by you as opposed to others.    My apologies for my delay in responding to your earlier message.    I was in London and will be continuing to London to find out about your dealings and  what you have in store for me there.

I am Mr. Larisa Nitterka, the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso-West African. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that we shall be able to trust you with the information we have here in front of us. In 1990, when I became the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso, I discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5million dollars (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family while he was on a trip to Dubai in UAE in 2000.Sometime after the death of this customer, prior to his untimely demise, this account was audited and found out to be dormant and inactive for the past 3 years running. From my investigation, I also discovered that the owner of the account Mr. Warren Davidson died without a [heir] hence the money is left in the custody of the bank.According to the Burkina-Faso laws and regulations, if such money remains dormant or inactive for more than 3 years in the charge of our bank, the money will be transferred into the custody of the government department. In order to avert this, I got your contact through a reliable and a knowledgeable person who had the information needed to execute this transaction. I have made up my mind to seek for your assistance and cooperation to enable us conclude the transfer within 14 working days of the date of this letter. If you are willing to work with me, you are expected to indicate your interest to me by giving me your direct and private telephone number and fax number, which I will provide at the time of transaction. There is no risk involved in this matter, the information we need is a legal claim to the account, which a witness will produce at the time the funds are transferred. As soon as you confirm your ability to execute this transaction, we shall furnish you with the details. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. A favorable conclusion to this matter would be appreciated. Please send your reply to my confidential email address.

I am married to a midwife and have two children.My late husband was the managing director of Trans-Africa Company in Nigeria before his sudden death in June 2000. Before his death, he told me that he deposited a huge sum of amount, (USD$14.5million) with finance and security company in Accra- Ghana. He told me that he deposited this money in my bank as Africa World Fund (A.W.F.) or Asiatic World Fund (A.W.F.) as it was called then. He also told me that it was because of this that some of his close advisers deserted him during the crisis in Nigeria during the last time he was in office as president of Nigeria. Because of this, my husband was forced to step aside as president of the bank while the existing president is still interested in starting a new government, for he wanted to deploy some of this money (USD$14.5million) to fund his various private and political causes while he was president. Unfortunately, since 1999, my husband was not at liberty to visit our country due to my country's political instability, hence I cannot be sure of his safety. Moreover, he told me that he has plans to do this in his spare time. I am contacting you because I want you to know that I have a proposition for you. He told me that he intended to put up a consignment (constitutional instruments) in my bank as a security deposit for this money (USD$14.5million) and he also told me that it was his intention to buy arms from my bank to defend this money (USD$14.5million) from any rogue government officials. Such arms are now officially called \"confiscates\" and they will be kept securely in the \"Confiscates\" section of my bank vault as valuables.I have all the necessary legal documents that would be used to back up any claim we may make.

I got your contact while i was doing a research on a trustworthy foreign partner in Europe who can assist me to invest the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million five hundred thousand United States dollars) with your assistance. As you can attest to, my father was a very wealthy and well-known businessman in my country of Liberia. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) with a security company in Europe.  His business associates, including my father, relied on this as the means of meeting up with him at his back door in Europe during those early weeks of August 1999. But on the 20th of sept 2000, the French military convoyed our house and arrested 40 of my father's associates. Some of my father's business associates including some of his top government functionaries including my father-elect were eventually smuggled out of Africa by French special forces. At this point my father-elect was in the process of being charged under the state of emergency that has been in force in Liberia since the death of my father, for allegedly financing the support groups that fight against the virile president of Liberia, who is also the president of west Africa, Mr. Charles Taylor. So my father-elect has been arbitrarily detained without trial. It is because of these circumstances that my father released my mother and I father's associates the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) from the security company in Europe. I need your assistance, as I am sure that with the help of you we can have our money's worth deposited in your account at a reputable security company in your country of choice. I don't want your help, as I must have the intention of using this money to establish an independent life, but your absolute equality to my father's associates assures me that I will get the results of this transaction without any problem. As for myself, I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free, because I will be working with my father's associates on this.  I need your fully confidential and honest assistance in securing the necessary legal permits and clearance needed for the movement of the funds.  With your fully confidential and honest assistance, we can have our life as a family in the west Africa.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I am doing some contract analysis, and I am able to identify the following scenarios: (i) a client intends to put a large amount of money to a foreign account (to establish a foreign bank account in London; see section ii).  (ii) a client has a bank account in Namibia and intends to convert the account into a domestic account (to open a bank account in London);\n\n(iii) the client has the account in London because the account is held in Switzerland.  The client has to establish a transfer to the Namibian account, as this is the only legal channel available to the UK, and the client will have to establish a counterparty counterparty account to the Namibian account and a counterparty counterparty counterparty account to the London account.   Furthermore, because the client is transferring the account to London, the account is not in our view an \"old bank\" account, but instead a new banking institution.  A new  bank account which has the proper bank account numbers is  sufficient.  (c) a client is sending funds to the London account because it is located in Switzerland, and the client is transferring funds to the London account because it is in the UK.  It is not necessary for the client to send funds from either UK or Switzerland.  We prefer that the clients are able to establish a separate offshore account (i.e. the account is  British owned, and have the appropriate account  numbers).  (d) the client intends to create an account on a French bank account in the UK and  transfer funds to the London account.  The client does not plan to communicate the  funds to you.  We will work with your office on this matter.  Thanks.

EMAIL:m_b_aba@yahoo.co.uk Dear Friend, I am Mr.B.A.A.Baines a representative of auditing firm auditing firm of Burkina Faso.We are  in possession of a consignment of (USD$15.5 MILLION U.S.Dollars) which consists of ( 15.5 MILLION U.S.Dollars ) seventeen (17) calendar days old. This money was deposited by Mr. Ndelebue in a BANK here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso in the continental United Kingdom. and is presently in the custody of the security company here in Cotonou Benin.Presently, the money is with the Bank in Cotonou and the owner of the account Mr. Ndelebue is dead. And the only other person that knows about this consignment is my lawyer who was with me at the time of deposit and we both know that Mr. Ndelebue is dead. So how the consignment got to us is beyond the knowledge of me. I cannot move about freely now that I know about the deceased. I used to travel a lot among the different countries of Africa but now that I am in Cotonou, I am very cautious and to a large extent confined. I once dared to venture out on a fairly clear day and I lost my way.

This money was deposited by Mr. Ndelebue in a BANK here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso in the continental United Kingdom. and is presently in the custody of the security company here in Cotonou Benin.Presently, the money is with the Bank in Cotonou and the owner of the account Mr. Ndelebue is dead. And the only other person that knows about this consignment is my lawyer who was with me at the time of deposit and we both know that Mr. Ndelebue is dead. So how the consignment got to us is beyond the knowledge of me. I cannot move about freely now that I know about the deceased. I used to travel a lot among the different countries of Africa but now that I am in Cotonou, I am very cautious and to a large extent confined. I once dared to venture out on a fairly clear day and I lost my way.

On a final inspection of the consignment held by my foreign partner in a Danish Police station here in Oslo, I discovered an abandoned consignment of a sum of $15.5million dollars(US$15.5million dollars) in an account that belongs to that of one of the top military/ intelligence(Two generals in charge of defense policy in this country) with total sum of US$15.5million dollars stashed in a *private, yet to be released to them since his passing in 2016. These people were in charge of supplying arms to the rebels in rebel country of Central America. My offer to assist you in repatriating this money and placing it in a capable legitimate account in your country should be granted to you on your acceptance of this business proposition. On my part, I have a list of 20 accounts in my office for deposit. I am the only person aware of this wealth in my office and of course I intend to share this wealth with my colleague.According to the Dutch laws on dormant account, if such amount remains unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the federal government treasury as unclaimed fund. My proposal is that, if you agree to assist me, I will let you know where the money is kept. If you agree to this, your role in the transaction would be to stand as the foreign contractor and claim this amount in your account. You will then come and claim this amount in your personal account in your country. I will be there to assist you in receiving the money after you have been claimed. I have all the documents to back-up this claim and I guarantee that this deal will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.

I am a lawyer practicing international who was in NIGERIA in Nigeria for more than 25 years.  In NIGERIA I have the privilege of working with individuals representing the President, the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and many others. I have never seen one of my clients represented by a Nigerian attorney in a civil action brought by their country.  My client has always been a competent but low profile individual who has only a past as a prominent businessman.  My client's lawyers are always in NIGERIA and I assume their client have an American lawyer.  I take the liberty of representing clients, many of whom are well connected, multi-national corporations, many of whom are represented by the likes  of  Douglas Giron, and some of which are represented by the likes of Roger and  John Arnold.   I have no  personal experience with these clients and  don't know if  my understanding of the law  applicable in their case is sufficiently extensive  or  correct.    If you  have any comments or queries   please contact my office.  The case is  currently to be heard before an arbitration panel.  I am  hoping that you  can  make this transaction on the 31st of October  2001  so that we are in touch with each other.

This time will allow shipping from Hong Kong (1-2 days) and  delivery of the package by Hong Kong air to Singapore (12  March). It has  also been suggested you should choose \"Hong Kuei, East - Hong Kong\" as it has the cheapest    shipping options and is the easiest   choice.

You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. SOURCE OF MONEY: The owner of the said account was Mr. Osvaldo Derdele an Italian by name, who was an investment and commodities merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. and his business partner were both citizens of the same country, so they too were not surprised when, in July 2000, Mr. Osvaldo Derdele died, leaving an account with the said bank with a closing balance of (USD$12,500,000.00) as at September 3, 2004 with all the account details and documents pertaining to the said deposit cancelled and all documents relating to the account expunged from the records. You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. On the 21st of July, 2004, while I was on business trip to Dubai with my partner, we discovered an abandoned trunk box in an ungodly heat, the box was closed and locked, and no one was around to open the box, and we proceeded to call for help, and found ourselves in search for someone to stand as our next of kin, because the ADB does not allow such things to remain more than 5 years, in other words we will be probed for the next of kin as at now nobody is coming for the claim of the trunk box. We will charge you 30% of the total sum for your assistance/assistance, 60% shall be for me ,and 10% would be for any expenses/expenses that may be incurred during the process of the transaction.

Dear Friend, I am a lawyer practicing in Lagos, the personal attorney to late Mr. Bruce  Ekso of Nigeria. Mr. Ekso is a citizen of Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Deputy Chief  Legislative Appointments Committee of Federal  Government Of Nigeria (G.N) and is also the chief lawyer in Lagos, (Federal  Judicial Services). On June 20, 2000, my client,his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. Unfortunately, their lives were thrown into disarray by the incident. Shortly after the accident, my client got very sick and later died, while the couple's only son and daughter survived the accident. Since then I have been expecting one of my clients who was supposed to come over to Nigeria to claim his money and property left behind by his deceased employer. Unfortunately, we got word that he died leaving no beneficiary to the account. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and the company. My client had an account with one of the leading security and finance Corporation,(C.SC),and the fund is presently with a Finance Company in the US and European, close to the top 2 Government Official(G.NIC) of Nigeria. So, to save the company from total bankruptcy, the government is looking for a reliable foreign partner to assist us in the business, included in the agreement with you, I shall be paid 20% of the total amount, while the remaining 80% will be for the company. All legal documents for this transaction will be carefully worked out including the notarization of your contract and consent of your to enter into the agreement.

On June 20, 1999, an Iraqi Foreign Worker with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Mahmood al-Wasati, with his entire family perished in a plane crash.

And from there it will be deposited with a private security company. And finally, after six months, the money will be reclaimed from the custody of the security company.

FROM:Dr. James Alexander. Tutor, Financial Transformation and Institutions of Last Resort. 186 Corporation Street, Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria. Attn: The President. Dear Sir, RE: TRANSFER OF ($10.4MILLION) FOUR MILLION US DOLLARS. I know this letter may come to you as a surprise, but please bear with me and we will go over a very sensible business. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2004, an Iraqi private contractor with the US firm, hired by my firm, made a numbered time (Fixed) contract valued at ($10.4MILLION) US DOLLARS with our Company here in Lagos-Nigeria. According to our documentation, this contract was satisfactorily executed and date stamped. All the contractors that was supposed to make delivery were actually scheduled to receive their paychecks on the 21st of June, 2004. Upon the receipt of the paychecks though, the contractors started to send no funds to the company. The company started to dredge the docks in order to keep the contract documents and documentation valid, but they eventually stopped due to lack of labor force. A closer look at the web site of the main contractor, (http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/12/13/kenya.crash/index.html), and you will see that the site has been completely destroyed by the Nigerian Navy. The government has also begun to investigate on charges that the company did not declare the profits on many contracts it executed in the country. Though it may seem strange to you of whom you know the situation in the world, but when a government official makes a contract with you, it usually means something is amiss. This is why it is essential to have a trusted and reliable person in this transaction, because then the government official can usually be made the beneficiary. For your assistance, I have agreed to pay 30% of the total sum to you, while 10% will be set aside for all the expenses we may incurred during the process of this transaction. You are entitled to 10% of the sum if you agree to perform this service for me. I shall require your full name, address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication, while giving a few details to give you an idea of what the transaction entails. I will expect your reply to this letter so as to friend me enough to allow me hire your company to collect some time in your company. I expect your response to this letter please, I look forward to your response.

I am the manager of breeder of negroes and ...   the owner/ operator of breeder of negroes in NIGERIA. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On May 8, 1999, an American air traffic controller working in the International Air Line Service at LAX11 made an Order in my office to drop all incoming air cargo containing cash totaling US$32M in cash exceeding the stipulated amount of US$32M in cash in an account in my bank.On further investigation it was established that the account belongs to one Mr. Fredy H.   John who was the chief air traffic controller in Lagos, Nigeria and also a contractor with the Nigerian Ministry of Transport in the year 2000.And he died while on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February,2003.And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it; all my colleague knows about it is that I witnessed his last rites. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $32M in a private security company in Europe. Even his partner at the time who was with him at the time,jokingly stated that the consignment was in an account that belongs to one of his contractors that died in 2003. And since the death of his contractor, Mr. John, John has been depositing huge sums of money in a single account in Europe. In my office I discovered that the consignment with the amount mentioned above was lodged in a security company which I disclosed to my colleagues. All my colleagues are now waiting to be paid because my colleagues died with the sum of $32M in their account. But before that, it is necessary to disclose to you that if you are not interested in the business, no one will be. I want you to understand clearly that the client is coming from a reputable company and he wants you to treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality because of the amount involved. I want you to know that this transaction is 100% risk free if you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality because of the amount involved. That is why I contacted you for assistance in this regard. I want you to know that this transaction is 100% risk free if you treat it with utmost confidentiality and confidentiality because of the amount involved.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On May 8, 1999, an American air traffic controller working in the International Air Line Service at LAX11 made an Order in my office to drop all incoming air cargo containing cash totaling US$32M in cash exceeding the stipulated amount of US$32M in cash in an account in my bank.On further investigation it was established that the account belongs to one Mr. Fredy H.   John who was the chief air traffic controller in Lagos, Nigeria and also a contractor with the Nigerian Ministry of Transport in the year 2000.And he died while on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February,2003.And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it; all my colleague knows about it is that I witnessed his last rites. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $32M in a private security company in Europe. Even his partner at the time who was with him at the time,jokingly stated that the consignment was in an account that belongs to one of his contractors that died in 2003. And since the death of his contractor, Mr. John, John has been depositing huge sums of money in a single account in Europe. In my office I discovered that the consignment with the amount mentioned above was lodged in a security company which I disclosed to my colleagues. All my colleagues are now waiting to be paid because my colleagues died with the sum of $32M in their account.

THIS MONEY WAS DISGUISED AND SHIPPED TO ONE OF THE EUROPEIAN COUNTRY BY THE TIME WE ARRANGED TO BRING THIS FUND. HOWEVER DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE THE FUND HAS BEEN INCREASED IN SALES DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND REVIEWING OF APPLICATIONS, WE SAW THE AMOUNT OF TOKENS CONSIGNED AND SENT OUT TO SEIZE THE PROGRESS. WE ARE STILL ASSURING THE COMPLETE COMPLEMENT OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRACE OF THE CONTRACT. WHEN THE BUSINESS IS COMPLETED AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE LEFT OVER SUM WILL BE REMITTED TO THE LEFT OVER BANK. CONSIDERING THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF TRANSFER OF THIS ACCURACY, WE SAW THE RISK OF OVERSEASING OF THE MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THIS LOT OF US,BECAUSE THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS THIRTY TWO MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. WE SAW THE IMMUNITY OF THE BUSINESS WITH THE BANK AND DID NOT SUSPEND THE APPLICATION, SINCE WE REACHED BANKED UNDER OUR CONTROL.

OPPORTUNITY RED HILL,  LAGOS-NIGERIA. PORTFOLIO OF THE NIGERIAN WELFARE AND RELATIONS. AUSTRALIA. Dear Sir/Madam,  I am  MAMA  KAYANE, THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPT. IN THE NIGERIA WELFARE CENTRE. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRANSFERING THE LEFT OVER SUM OF US$23.MILLION (TWENTY- EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ). THIS MONEY WAS DISGUISED AND SHIPPED TO ONE OF THE EUROPEIAN COUNTRY BY THE TIME WE ARRANGED TO BRING THIS FUND. HOWEVER DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE THE FUND HAS BEEN INCREASED IN SALES DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND REVIEWING OF APPLICATIONS, WE SAW THE AMOUNT OF TOKENS CONSIGNED AND SENT OUT TO SEIZE THE PROGRESS. WE ARE STILL ASSURING THE COMPLETE COMPLEMENT OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRACE OF THE CONTRACT. WHEN THE BUSINESS IS COMPLETED AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE LEFT OVER SUM WILL BE REMITTED TO THE LEFT OVER BANK. CONSIDERING THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF TRANSFER OF THIS ACCURACY, WE SAW THE RISK OF OVERSEASING OF THE MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THIS LOT OF US,BECAUSE THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS THIRTY TWO MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. WE SAW THE IMMUNITY OF THE BUSINESS WITH THE BANK AND DID NOT SUSPEND THE APPLICATION, SINCE WE REACHED BANKED UNDER OUR CONTROL. IT IS FROM OUR REASON THAT I AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN MY  DEPARTMENT ARE NOW SEEKING FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION TO CARRY OUT THE PROCESS OF THE TRUNK LOT AND INVEST $15.5 MILLION (FIFTY M (FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS )) DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER. IT WILL BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IN NIGERIA DUE TO THE RISK MODE OF THIS BUSINESS. CONCLUSIVELY, IT IS OUR PLEASURE TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE TOTAL SUM, WHICH I COULD SINCERELY EXPECT FROM YOU DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER DUE TO SAFE KEEPING THE ACCOUNTS IN US TO A SAFE LEVEL OF 3,500 (USD) PER DAY, DURING THE COURSE OF THE BUSINESS. THIS KINDLY INDICATES YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US AND ALSO WE CONCLUDE THE DETAILS OF THE TRANSFER.

This is due to the fact my name is John Bales the only son of Dr. and Mrs.  John Bales we contacted you concerning a business transfer of a fortune to your account. We have prepared a transfer document that will enable us transfer the sum of (USD$10.000.00 million) ten million United States Dollars to a foreign account. This amount (US$10.000.00 million) has been floating in the Federal Reserved Bank here in Cotonou Benin West Africa for the last four years now and has been successfully transferred to any account of your choice, however, I will like you to review the instructions for this transaction and ensure you understand their meaning. Due to my current situation as an asylum seeker in Benin Republic, I am not permitted to operate any account and hence I am contacting you for assistance to claim the money in your account.

Although the message is short, I believe it to be a very informative article on the subject of currency in our bank.  It would be very interesting to read the article in our banks.  You have given me access to the financial magazine, The Economist.  They have an article on currency.  I am interested in the article below (the editorials are somewhat controversial) as we are going to discuss the following issues: 1.    Is the money supply in India a significant driver of interest on the currency page? 2.    Is the currency price driven by a major driver of interest on the currency page?  3.    Does the money flow from a high tolerance/high velocity currency page (like India) have more relevance than low tolerance currency pages?   For example we have talked about the risk that India faces as a currency user. 4.    To what extent does the editorials themselves matter?  For me the important thing is to understand where they are coming from.  For this we are already in the process of reviewing the issues so please feel free to give me your thoughts & suggestions as to where you would like us to discuss currency/GMC page.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $US15 million dollar (Fifteen million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 31st October,2003 in a plane crash in Cotonou - Benin. You shall read more stories about the crash on visiting this site:(http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/10/26/benin.crash) and (http://www.wral.com/news/16320517/detail.html). Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his Only Son and Daughter) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this situation behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a resident of Benin Republic of Benin and a local farmer, while the customer was also a resident of Benin Republic of Benin. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was also unemployed and retired from the service of the Bank. I agree that 30% of this money shall be for you as foreign partner, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses incurred during the business. I will seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this transaction can be paid to you, while the remaining 70% shall be for me. You should note that a fixed deposit is a security mechanism under which the fund is lodged and it is only the account owner who can authorize the movements of the money. I will provide the instructions to enable you obtain the money in your account as arranged.Should you be interested,please reply urgently so that I will send you the detailed instructions.Thanks for your co-operation and I shall give you the detailed instructions as soon as I receive your response.

I think I have  a 95%  chance that the  analyst's  test is correct. \n \n \n 2 - You say it looks unlikely the analyst will  give full  deposition (due to NDA)  on the issue of trading floor latency because  NDA is not a  requirement.  However if the analyst  is 100% sure this  wasn't done,  then he will  certainly  report the trade floor latency issue, but will  the full  deposition be admissible. \n \n 3 - The only other source you've  heard that  has  been able  to confirm your hypothesis is a  person who is familiar with those  operations who  has experience  management  in the  area (NDA,  trade floor  latency  management, etc.). What do  you think of this  ?\n\nI'll try to be available to do full  deposition, but if anything  prevents you, please let me know. \n\nBest  regards,\n\nDarrell\n\nPS A thought for those interested:  Are you guys able to get the slides on your  analyst  during your  5 min session today ? You hear NOLM say  that the analyst may have some  doubts if they take the material all the way through ?\n\nRegards, Darrell\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Prof.Neil Diamond\nTitle: GOOD DAYS\n GOOD DAYS Dear Sir, I am Prof.Neil Diamond, the Auditor General of Alhaji Bank of Al-Hijaz,A suburb of Al-Hijaz, in the province of Diyala.

I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million US Dollars(USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 25% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 75% will be for me and my colleagues while 5% will be set aside for all the expenses we incurred during the transaction.My role in this transaction is that I will stand as beneficiary and manager of this fund while the rest will be for me and my colleagues.The transaction has to be concluded before the end of the year 2000, when the new president of the republic of Ghana, General Sanogo Dos Santos takes office, I will be working with my colleagues to transfer this money to any country of your choice, where the money will be safe and we can fully operationalize this fund. As soon as this money gets to your country, you are expected to apply to the bank as next of kin to the deceased for the transferal of the fund, as indicated in our banking guidelines.

I am writing you this message to update you on this proposal.  \n\nI am currently working my full time here at the firm as a research person but the time we will be  meeting saturday is for 3 person teams.  This  is true for the London team but they  can handle 2 or more?  They are required to call  us to discuss this proposal but only one team will be allowed to  attend  for one hour.  I am sure  that you cannot let a member or former employee handle this  proposal as you would not like them to be seen as the facilitator  in  the meeting on the saturday  meeting.  I  have assured her that this proposal is not for sale and that she can  let one person handle this initiative. \n\nIf you have not informed them in advance of this meeting what would you  like to be present for the meeting and any  co-ordinator of this initiative ?\n\nI am sure that we can meet  with no problem and if you  wish that we can, then you are free to inform the person  you want to  meet on the 15th at our office.  The problem we will be  facing is that  the UK is about to have the 1st of May  a Eurobond network  launched and to put that network together would require some  of our people have to be in the building on the first  of the  May.   I hope you are having fun in your  trip  and I will get a good long term arrangement with your  company so that the work I do will be done in London  and not in NY for example\n\nThe London group\n\nG. van Rossum   <van Rossum g.vanderrossum@enron.com>                                                                04/07/2008 09:40   IMMEDIA RELEASE  Re:  London       Conference Announcement from the London Group  London\n\n\nMr. van Rossum@UK", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom:   kone\nTitle: PROPOSAL\n PROPOSAL Dear Friend I am Mr. KONE,the Auditor General of  the German Federal Ministry of Finance.

We had lunch together several months back and you assured me that your husband was doing well. He told me that your first husband was much worse, and that he was more afraid of you. I didn't think that either of them would be able to stand one-on-one contact. Well, he was right. He said the first time I told him that I had had a problem with my voice, which is a very common problem for couples, he told me I sounded harsh and harsh.  I told him, I don't mind talking about it. It is fine.  He is very interested in what I have to say.  We have discussed it before but were not able to come to any agreement. We'll try to reach an agreement at some later date.  I know your husband is doing great. Your kids are doing well, too.  They were even up in the new place (Bali) in August...I got all of them in.  I don't miss the old place any more, though I do miss the kids. I am doing fine (except for one day I am on the road for a week and then I can't work). It is going really well for you. Let's try to keep the kids close. Do have some problems...and not just with your husband.  The kids are very worried about yours.  I am pretty worn out being on the road, so I will probably do less of this stuff for a while. I think I am getting my fitness levels back.  And I need some rest! Hope you are doing great. In any event, I will try to call you in a couple weeks. Again, good luck with you and God bless!

I am George Demb\u00e9, the accountant general of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He succeeded in getting the funds that belong to my client the former chairman of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Sani Abacha, who died in 2nd of October 1999, here in Nigeria. You shall read more about the Abacha family  crisis on this website:  http://www.ngr.net/abacha099.htm Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claims of these funds, as his next of kin, this is why I contacted you for your assistance to claim the funds as close of kin to the deceased. The monetary amount involved is (USD Ten Million United States Dollars Only)   $10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) As you may know, the laws and constitution of Nigeria do not allow citizens of country to open account in this central bank so I need your consent to account for me here in Nigeria. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email, indicating your details, your banking address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and also your Family Name, if any. I shall then forward your information to the accountancy firm for further instructions including the source of the funds.

As I have mentioned before, the first URGENT REQUEST I  received was back from a customer complaining that there were  many orders and that there was no information to  reply to.  Well, I have  received a reply, which states the following.      I have no intention of doing that, even if  it does not require the reply.  I am sorry that such an issue is  presented, but I was travelling today and  having  several cases at first hand.      Will you be able to look at my documents and  verify that there is no information  to reply to.    Please advise as to what  is required and advise that you accept such  documents even if  some or all of the requirements are fulfilled if I  agree.  We   also  request that you send the original  document to us as proof that I have read them, and to confirm that the  owner is indeed you and your representative, and that I  will be able to provide such  evidence if so asked.  This  does  leave me short of what I propose to  deliver, since the  original document needs to be sent to the relevant  place as proof.  Please  advise  me as to what I am to  deliver or where you would  like it  signed.  I  would like to be able to deliver it and  provide you a receipt for  the  delivery.  Let me  know if you require any further explanation.  If you  do not feel as I have done a  suitable job or not  sufficient, let us have a talk and  I, as head of  the team, could contact the relevant  place to determine who  to contact and how many  to deliver to you.  Thanks.    Regards,                                                                                                     ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr. Steve,\nTitle: URGENT REPLY NEEDED\n URGENT REPLY NEEDED Dear Sir, My name is Mr. Steve Henry.
