I was going to contact you to find out more about what we could expect from them,is that you are  responsible for getting the financing for the completed transaction.\ufffd; I am not sure what the exact terms of the financing agreement are, but  hopefully I can help you on that front.\n \n As you will recall from your discussions with Daren, we have a very specific set of financing needs in place to allow us to fully execute on our PPA.  The funds required to fully implement these needs are contained in the credit default swap agreements (as amended) that Daren and I discussed.  In addition, we have specific written agreements with Bernard and Chip in mind as to the specific terms under which they will support our request for a credit default swap.  I also want to make sure that any changes to the cross-network language are in writing and attatched to the documents.  Finally, I want to make sure that any compensation plan that Daren proposes is consistent with the provisions of the credit agreement and the equity information contained in the financial statements.  \n\n \n As you will recall from your discussions with Daren, we are comfortable to discuss any changes that you think necessary or desirable to  closing the credit gap.  \n\n Please contact me with your comments and I will try to include those documents with the Cashing Agreement and in-home delivery  fee agreement. \n\nMike McGowan 11/29/2000 08:33 AM To: Mike McGowan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:  \n\nSubject: Re: Misc\n\n \n\nI am not sure what David said but what I understood as \"I'm sorry we have waited this long\" was David Maxwell's response.

I have negotiated with the security company to free up the balance of the deposit to you for the free transfer of this money into your account.I will be happy to give you 20% of the total amount, 5% is set aside for expenses incurred during the process of the transaction, 60% is for my own use.Should this proposal interest you, please contact me immediately and let me know that you are pursuing the transaction, and what you are about to invest in. I wait for your soonest response. Thank you. Best Regards, Mr. Jasper B.

To avoid any confusion and/or misinformation regarding when we last traded, I thought that it would be better to keep the news from you and the traders a secret.  I also wanted to make sure you received your instructions accurately.  While I don't know what you are trading with us for, the options that we provide are unique to us and we intend to continue adding value to your trading platform.

It was not a good day to trade because we had a big hold in hand-me-down coal, which I didn't manage to get out on that particular trading day.  It was a pretty big deal, even by our standards, and we kind of just threw it in the bin.  Nobody really knows what it is, but whoever is doing the trading knows what they are doing.

I have forwarded on here the presentation I gave at the February meeting, where I discussed the differences between  the US and CANADA.  It was a pretty extensive talk, and I think my presentation was the main focus of the talk.  Although I did not get your questions, the ANA emails I received earlier this week may have provided some context.  Given the political climate in Canada, I was trying to be as non-political as I could, but I realize that is not always easy.   I do not think the answers I gave in that talk were what you were looking for, but I am not sure how to get your questions.   If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMargaret\n\n-----Original Message----- From: Hayslett, Janet   Sent: 19 February 2001 8:16 AM To: Belden, Tim Subject: RE: DONATION FOR PHYSICAL USE ONLY\n\nI am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.

If possible, it would  also be good if there were a video or slides to give investors a better idea of where our  stands.  I am not sure at this time whether we should use a  computer or the internet.  I know we have a lot of explaining to do, but I am confident that when the issues come out that we have been quiet, we will be able to effectively  address them.\n\nAs regards to staffing, I am having serious consideration of recruiting Phil Baehr to be our interim CEO.  Baehr has been CEO for only a few days, but he has already shed a lot of  light on the issues and plans for resolving them.  I am not sure what the final decision will be, but I  will keep you updated when I do get the answer.\n\nAs regards communications, I will be glad to provide any questions or comments you may have.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul\n\n-----Original Message----- From: Tina Corea [mailto:Tina_Corea@wapa.gov] Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 9:02 AM To: Paul Wilkinson Subject: Re: From Mr. Jameis to Mr. Kalb\n\nI am not sure what happened in the call last night.

I do not know whether Elizabeth Doane  spoke for Pat McAdam or Elizabeth Brantz when she spoke to the SME's on the West Point matter, but I do know that Pat was somewhat frustrated because he felt that he had to negotiate terms with Elizabeth before he would even consider completing the audit.

I WILL BE VERY PROSECUTING AND UPSETED IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE MY KIND CONFIDENCE AND SOURCE OF FUNDS.

FOR THIS REASON IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HIS PROPOSAL FOR YOUR PAYMENT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS (US$20,000,000.00.) WITH A SECURITY COMPANY. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HIS PROPOSAL YOU CAN SEND ME AN EMAIL VIA MY LOCATION, AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE CONTACT OF THE SECURITY COMPANY NAME AND CONTACT ADDRESS WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.

I didn't overhear anything but thought it would be good to hear your side of the  Cash Flow Concern.  Obviously the income statement is attached so I am not sure what is happening with the receivables.  The short version is that the credit line for the credit imbalance is written up as a liability on the statement and the item 2 through 6 on the statement of Cash Flows are blank.  I am not sure what is meant by the remaining balance sheet emblazoned across the top with \"NEXT year $ MTM obligation not to exceed last year's\"  I am not sure what the hell that means.  It sounds like we are supposed to be paying them in this year.  What is on the Statement of Cash Flows?  \n\nI have attached a summary of the financials for the last two years providing an idea of what is on the Statement of Cash Flows.  I am not sure what the last two years are about but my recollection is that  they are the same as this post is a work in progress.  Unless somebody can give me their hand I am not going to work on the Statement of Cash Flows any longer.  At this point I am not sure what the hell is going on with the receivables.  I know we paid the farmers last summer for arable lands and it was due to them for the planting and I was supposed to get paid for the present and future years but I hear some people complaining about arable  sales and I have no idea what the hell is going on.  Unless you guys have any  clue I am going to bed.\n\nYou've sent me bills.  What is on the DVDs?  I can't find anything.

Amended and Restated Master Agreements are intended to be the \"soft landing\" documents and do not in any way establish or imply that there is any intent of merger with any previous entity.\n \n C. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confirmation of Transaction\n This is where we can get our financials in line with the sales.  The items for which we are in agreement have been paid for and deliveries have not yet taken place.  We can sign the agreement and forward it to Sales for execution but I am not sure how long we will be there to assist them.  If we are not able to do any of this ourselves, we will find a way to assist them other than by copying the verbal agreements and organizing them", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Tonya P.

Williams from Ivory Coast. I am married to Mr.Williams Jonassen ... who worked with Ivory Coast Embassy in Dakar Senegal for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both dedicated christain. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he made a huge deposit in my name in a security company in Dakar Senegal. Presently, this deposit is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my   ailment I have decided to donate this fund to either a church, individual or a ministry that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this fund to be used in the Orthodox Church,Churches,Orphanages and Widows. If you  find any interest in this letter,please do reply me immediately and I will give you further clarifications.

The one I do get are those that I am not sure are from you at all.  The ones that are not from me and sent to the e-mail I do not agree with.  The ones that are from people that I know and trust is it is ok for me to respond back to all of your e-mails without even reading them first.  What did you say you were going to do about the VEPCO system being in default for the foreseeable future?  That is the only thing I can think of that is not me that is at risk if the default is not achieved within the next few days.\nI do not know exactly what happened last time they called, other than they (I think it was her) were in a hurry and said something like, \"I am not sure we will be able to answer all of your questions, so I am going to call you and see exactly what you have for breakfast today.\"  I am glad you have an answer, but I am not sure what is going on.  I will try to answer all of your questions as best I can.\nI will be in Chicago on Wednesday and Thursday. Will you be able to help me prepare my notes for my flight home?  I am not sure what is going on with the VEPCO accounts, but I thought they were added next week.\nAll the best,\nAmy\n \n   -----Original Message----- \n From: \tFitzpatrick, Amy  \n Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 2:52 PM \n To:\tGoldfarb, Kristin; Steffes, James D.; Curless, Amanda \n Cc:\tCurtis, Jason; Call, Scott; Herndon, Rogers; Baughman Jr., Don; Sharfman, Guy; Herndon, Rogers; Keeler, Matt; Pittenger, Cathy; Baughman, Edward D.; Shelk, Patti \n Subject:\tEPO/Em/Co > EPO/Em/Safe Harbor > \n \n Hello, \n The subject of the email you sent \n with reference number 0001 in the title above, \n \n concerns an amendment to EPO that was sent to CAISO on > January 16, 2001. \n \n The amendment, as you requested, increases the amount paid to CAISO for the ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: sugar maples\nTitle: Re: Email from  Mrs. Sarita Gupta\n Re: Email from  Mrs. Sarita Gupta from the office of the Director of International Composition,New Delhi India.

I  have set up a secure system with three different\u00a0 emails to those in the legal/clinical side of things.  One of the things that I am not sure about the Merced River deal and the Chase deals is  the type of person they are evaluating. Is it someone with a lot of trading experience  like Paul Bass or new comers?  I  think they are looking for someone who knows how to value and manage capital.\n\nI will be in Chicago a couple of times in  July and August. One of the things that I would like to do is to get together  to talk about these deals.  I  think a lot of the work is\u00a0 done by teams of 5-6 people.

Some of the items that were included in the email are likely to be temporarily or permanently injurious to our operations, others may be temporary or ameliorative in that they  may provide a window of opportunity for us to evaluate the commercial value of the arrangements,  and still others may be permanent.  In addition, certain of the privileges and immunities that you have as a former employee will not be lost, whereas others may be lost over time.  I am not sure what the status is of the intellectual property rights issue, so  I can't vouch for the appropriateness of these proposals at this time.  If you  are in a position to provide a firm price, I would be happy to do so.  However, in the current climate, where there is considerable uncertainty in the political climate in both the oil and financial markets, I am not  optimistic that a price will emerge anytime soon.

My response is as follows:\nMrs. Gabrelo, \nI am not sure that the address given in your message to the financial officer was the actual one she was supposed to be sending the check for the address on 02/20/2001.  My research has shown that the check for the address is dated and signed for the month of June, and the check for the amount to be paid for the month of June is signed and paid for that month by Ms. Lizzette Bryant, and I believe the check for the legal fees are paid for that month by Ms. Bryant. \nHowever, based on the information you provided to the F.B.I., it appears that the check for the legal fees is paid for on or about 12/31/01, and the check for the increase in the legal fees is paid for on or about 12/32/01.  It is very difficult to determine which legal fees are which on 12/31/01 because the invoices for those legal fees have not yet been filed.  Given that there is \napproximately $15M in CDO's at that address, it is likely that the payments for those legal fees will be made either this month or the month of June.  Let me know if that is not the case.  Also, in case we are in a position to call for collateral in the event of default, should that be the case, what is the status of the written or oral agreements?\nI hope that I can not be of much further \ninformation, let me know.\nThanks, Kate\nMelissa Ann Murphy 04/03/2001 09:47 AM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT cc:  \nSubject: FW: Mrs. Agnes Fatima\nHello, Mrs. Agnes is prepared to give us a call at 9:00 a.m. today at her desk in the ETS to discuss her calendar.

There are too many transactions at this point to keep up with all of the \n transactions.

In addition, I need to understand what your plans are for the \n legal department in an effort to understand the different trading hours that I work.  \n With that said, I do have positive things to report about the economy in general.  One of the things that \n I was concerned about when I heard the news about the S&P 500 deal is how quickly it might turn into a problem for us if things \n break loose.  I don't know exactly what the timeline is for all of this, but from what I've read about the \n deals made by Mike Syeda, it seems like we could get down to business right away.  I mean, hypothetically, we could get the paperwork out today and start the \n trading session tomorrow.

Our discussions had been going on for some time now, and I had hoped that we would have a positive response from them on the trading floor.  Unfortunately, there has been some misunderstanding as to our actual positions and I am not sure  who is doing the interpreting for the day to day trading performance.  Please let me know if I can help you out. \n \n Suz -- I spoke with Jeanie on Friday and she told me that there were 3 banks that are to be interviewed this AM, one of them being BP.  She also said that Ken Lewis wanted to speak to George (FIT) and that she would pass along this e-mail to him.

If you do want to do an interview, I am available that evening.  By the way, I am not sure at this point who is paying for all this.  I have passed along to you Colin's memo on Arora and Solow.  I am not sure why he is the only one bringing any notes.  Do you know who Phil is calling from?  \n\nI am not sure at this time what will be good phone number to use to reach me.

It is a bit fancy for someone my age, but i think that says a lot about who i am becoming.  It is such an honour to be able to do this with all the attention on myself.  Anyways, i am not sure what to say or do.  I am glad you are having a great holiday season.  I am very shy and not at all comfortable around others.  At the risk of sounding self-important, i think for someone my age to be able to express themselves in ways that others are not, it is a great sign.  I am not sure what to wear next, between the suits or tops?  Personally, i am liking the suit a lot more than the rest, partly because it is my first suit and i am not sure which suit it is i am going to get.  Do you know which one it is which one of these guys is it a guest of honor?  Lol maybe i will just bring one of those things home and hem the tickets for you.  I am not sure which suit is which, but we can go back to the drawing board when we get some extra time.  Oh well, i am not sure which one i am not getting, so i will just make a note in the back of the ticket and i will mark it down.

In fact, I felt a great deal of distance already exists between us as entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists.  Perhaps it will be some time before we meet again, but I am hopeful that someday we will be able to connect again.  To the best of my knowledge, your email did not come through; however, I found a copy of it on your desk.  I take it that you are going to be attending Cornell.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work with you on financing and strategy for early stage companies.  As I remember it, you were very involved in the process of selling the Subway commercial franchisees.  I am not sure what your plans are for this venture, but I certainly wouldn't want to be involved in the decision-making process.  If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to address them.  By the way, I feel kind of strange talking to you on the phone.  I assume you are going to be attending grad school in business administration this summer, which is going to be a great way to get some experience.  Would you speak with us by phone if at all possible so we do not bother each other and go our separate ways?  By the way, I am not sure what is going on David;  you seem to have a lot of questions for someone so new to the MBA game.

But  for the record, I do not believe that I have a question regarding the fairness of the award.  The arbitrator in this case was appointed for a term of 6 months and has already proven himself to be fair and impartial.  The contract includes a provision that if the company fails to get adequate notice or justification for cancelling the prior written notice period, the consumer may not recover damages.  I am not sure what this means - a breach of contract charge only accrues to the party that didn't get adequate notice or justification for cancelling the prior written notice period - but if we have a firm date for the termination of the contract, I am willing to let that expire.  The second matter relates to the contractual provision that provides for payment in advance for future services not rendered.

I was born in Canada and raised in Calgary, but have been living in Bangkok, and currently study in London.  I was not aware that there was an entity called Pattaya Group  which is separate and apart from the CAG.  I am not sure what the  arrangement is between the two, if any.  \n\nAs you probably already know, I do not believe that we should be paying affiliate income unless they also should be receiving a fee.  I am also not sure that affiliates should be paying into a fund which, in my  opinion, is a very inefficient use of available credit.  I am not sure that there is anything in the by-laws which would require them to include a  fee.  Given the size of the project, and the complexity of the arrangements involved, I am not sure that we can afford to lose sight  of the fact that this is a fee agreement.  Can you direct the two pieces of work to be done by our then-Chief Operating Officer,  Jo Ann McElhany, to-date compensation knowledge, and direct them both to you in-house?

What I can tell you is that Patina is trying to negotiate contracts with EPMI on a competitive basis, and we have been discussing with them certain technical terms regarding the application of the marketing value provisions of the energy deals.  Yesterday, I asked them to please send me their contact information, so I could arrange a call with them.  The problem is that Patina has not had any activity in the past few weeks, and my understanding from my conversations with her, is that she  is probably dealing with regulatory matters in California.   As you know, there is some  regulatory complexity in the design of the sales process in California, and some fine print in the  agreements governing the deals.   I am not sure what the enforcement provisions of the agreements are in California, and I am not sure whether  the letters of credit designating Patina as the credit sponsor are sufficient.

I am Mrs. Elodie Nyong'o the wife of Mr. Nyong'o Nyong'o from Zimbabwe. We were married for twelve years without a child. During this period my husband was on a military operation in Zimbabwe. During this operation several people were killed and maimed, the most of these casualties were caused by the rebel group. During this period my husband was attacked by unknown persons. The reason why I contacted you is to seek your assistance in the area of my future investment and also to assist me in providing for my family. I will be glad to go into partnership with you, if you can be of good assistance to me. I am willing to offer you a percentage for your assistance, which will be appreciated. I will be glad to hear from you soon. Thanks and God bless you.

I do not know if any of this is new, but if  it is, I want to emphasize that the areas of agreement or differences exist because we have had differences both on the management and overall structure of the business.   In the past, Enron has used a process called \"preliminary/basis\" which is identical to the \"post-petition\" stage which is when the actual business is worked out and deals specifically with Enron's vertically and/or sub-sidiary businesses.  In the past, this has involved meeting with the client, reviewing contracts and providing business alternatives to clarify the differences.  This is no longer necessary as the agreements we have in place today are adequate and appropriate in light of the new realities.

Attn: Chairman/Director  Dear Sir/Madam, Compliments of the season on you and your kind heart I wished to contact you regarding my intention to invest and do business with you. I am Mr. Michael George, the son of (late) Chief Joseph George, a Bushilla Upstate of New York. My father was a Bushilla farmer and rancher in Liberia West Africa and he was the general Manager of the Cattle Ranch and dairy farms in (Monrovia, Gauteng,Slovenia). He was assassinated on or about May 23, 2002 by the rebels following the political uprising.  My mother died when I was a baby and since then my father took me so special. Before the arrival of the peace keeping troops my father had already made arrangement for me to come over to his country for better economic and developmental policy ment in accordance with the will of the donor.Since the peace keeping troops left on leave for their assigned posts, my father decided to let me stay with him in (Monrovia).  He gave me all the necessary  information  of where I could and could not go as I was directed by  them.

I have been away from the office sick.  It will be here tonight.  When I return, I will put together a copy of the form and envelope you sent me.  I do not know when I will be able to meet with you.

I do not know what to tell the neighbors about what is going on with the estate.  I am not sure what to expect on the estate as far as style and color of furniture.  I am not sure what to wear.  I have listened to some of the fashions and am not sure which ones to get rid of.  I am not sure what type of show you are having this weekend.  I am not sure what is happening with the cars.  I was hoping you were going to bring them into town this weekend for the big party.  I was down that weekend, but I am not sure what happened.  Where are you going next?  I am not sure what to bring.  I am not sure what to wear.  I was hoping you were having a great summer.  I am not sure what to do with the upturned can of tuna sticks.  I am not sure what is happening with the yellow legal pad.  I am not sure what class of business you will be joining us next.  I do not want to waste your time.
