Union Bank Of Nigeria Tugela Branch Lagos, Nigeria. Attn:I got your email address through internet when I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy individual for this important business trusting in your trust and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.      RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL: A British national, Mr. John McKee, an accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000, 000.00(Twenty-five million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On this deposit, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), that Mr. John McKee died on an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John McKee did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$25,000, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  So the amount USD$25.1 million.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John McKee so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that it will be immediately after you have been made the next of kin that the bank will start processing the transfer.  Upon this, a letter of Probate /Administration in your favor will be sent to you by the Bank to enable you get the needed information and documents.

Union Bank Of Nigeria Tugela Branch Lagos, Nigeria. Attn:I got your email address through internet when I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy individual for this important business trusting in your trust and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.      RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL: A British national, Mr. John McKee, an accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000, 000.00(Twenty-five million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On this deposit, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), that Mr. John McKee died on an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John McKee did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$25,000, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  So the amount USD$25.1 million.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John McKee so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that it will be immediately after you have been made the next of kin that the bank will start processing the transfer.  Upon this, a letter of Probate /Administration in your favor will be sent to you by the Bank to enable you get the needed information and documents.

Attention Please, I am the head of file department in the bank and I got your contact through one of the foreign customers who was robbed of his life by my branch. The name of the victim was ALEXANDRE BRUNU who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetlinerliner on March 9, 2000 flying from New York to Lome-Togo with the entire passengers on board.  I was informed of his death by the foreign customer who was with me in the bank when I was making the closure of the account. I was sobered by the news and I prayed over it and selected your contact as the person I wanted my bank to contact for this business.  On the transfer of this fund into your account, I sent a routine notification to your private fax number but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his bank that ALEXANDRE BRUNU died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  So now, when I look for a person to carry out this business deal with, I look for such person abroad who can be trusted and dependable, and also possess the money to cover this transfer.  I was sobered by this news and it's just for this reason that I prayed over it and selected your contact. I am Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI and my son is AMIN SHIRANI. I have a proposition for you. On the date of transfer, 40% of the total amount of $14,000,000.00 will be for you, 60% for me and my family and I and 10 % will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction.  Please, you have to be very careful and zealous in your attitude while you are in this business . I am asking because I don't want this money to go into your account as unclaimed bill.  I don't want this money to go into any account of yours. If you are willing to assist me, contact me so that we will discuss the modalities to see you in your country.

Attention Please, I am the head of file department in the bank and I got your contact through one of the foreign customers who was robbed of his life by my branch. The name of the victim was ALEXANDRE BRUNU who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetlinerliner on March 9, 2000 flying from New York to Lome-Togo with the entire passengers on board.  I was informed of his death by the foreign customer who was with me in the bank when I was making the closure of the account. I was sobered by the news and I prayed over it and selected your contact as the person I wanted my bank to contact for this business.  On the transfer of this fund into your account, I sent a routine notification to your private fax number but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his bank that ALEXANDRE BRUNU died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  So now, when I look for a person to carry out this business deal with, I look for such person abroad who can be trusted and dependable, and also possess the money to cover this transfer.  I was sobered by this news and it's just for this reason that I prayed over it and selected your contact. I am Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI and my son is AMIN SHIRANI. I have a proposition for you. On the date of transfer, 40% of the total amount of $14,000,000.00 will be for you, 60% for me and my family and I and 10 % will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction.  Please, you have to be very careful and zealous in your attitude while you are in this business . I am asking because I don't want this money to go into your account as unclaimed bill.  I don't want this money to go into any account of yours. If you are willing to assist me, contact me so that we will discuss the modalities to see you in your country.  If you receive this email, reply me back. I am waiting for your urgent response.. Thank you. Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE\nDear mariam amin Shirazi", "index": 16}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: John Ogle\nTitle: FROM: Mr.John Ogle\n FROM: Mr.John Ogle FROM: Mr.John Ogle DATE:STANDARD TIME.....

Dear friend. I am alice o gola, the manager of bill and exchange at the above mentioned Bank. On June 6, 2000, an America Petroleum Gas Company oil tanker, with full fuel, and on board were some 2,000 metric tons of TNT and other heavy duty explosives. These explosives were destined for Afghanistan as part of President Clinton's 'Operation Iraqi Freedom' contract awarded to America in 2000, but the contract was cancelled. The contract has since been reinstated. The contract was awarded to a foreign company, but the name of the company has not been disclosed. You shall read more news about the contract cancellation on BBC news.

I want you to direct your sights to: http://www.urgent.com/assistances/list/ Where I got your contact. I hope to hear from you soonest. I have decided to give you 25% of the total sum, 70% for us and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. As soon as you indicate your interest, call me to confirm your wish and also to arrange to meet with me in-country for the sharing of the fund according to the percentages indicated. Call me or send me direct e-mail. Yours Faithfully, alice o gola. Algeria.\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE.\nDear alice_olga,  The following email message will send an immediate response to your visit to our site.  Your safety is our top priority and we will deal with any outstanding issues informally.  However, we do not anticipate having to deal with these issues in the foreseeable future.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing you with an in-kind contribution to cover some of the shortfalls caused by your out-of-town colleagues.  Many of you have expressed interest in becoming financial supporters of the Agency.   As an added value, we feel it is in your interest to be offered the opportunity to find and develop customers in the local community.  This would be a natural step in that direction.  At the same time, it is in our opinion not to jeopardize any existing prospects by introducing unfamiliar or alternative business models into the mix.  Finally, there is not a great deal that can be done about the imminence of your plans to leave your current employer.  You will most likely find yourself competing head-to-head with others for limited available work.  To put this in perspective, you will most likely find yourself searching for new opportunities only to find that you are leaving your former company.  You may be thinking \"well, that is tough, considering I am currently on the outside looking in\".  To put this into perspective, consider that your former company may have been profitable, but was it a reflection of the work you actually did? Did you actually invest in and maintain the brands you were working to build? Did you actually bring new ideas to the table? Please feel free to contact me if you are unable to accomplish these objectives, and I will gladly assist you in any way that I can.  In addition to providing me with information regarding your company, I am also happy to provide you with some useful pointers regarding your own business.  These include: 1.  When selecting a new company, it is important to determine which of its many assets speak to it. 2.  What aspects of what does your company bring to the table? 3.  Does your company strive to be engaged with people instead of just numbers? 4.  Does your company meet or exceed their expectations? 5.  Does your company ever receive a \"clean bill of health\" from the IRS?  If the previous three items do not answer your questions, it is possible that your company has already paid its fair share of taxes.  If you are not sure, please contact me at 713.853-", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: alice_olga\nTitle: URGENT ASSISTANCE.\n URGENT ASSISTANCE.  Dear friend. I am alice o gola, the manager of bill and exchange at the above mentioned Bank. On June 6, 2000, an America Petroleum Gas Company oil tanker, with full fuel, and on board were some 2,000 metric tons of TNT and other heavy duty explosives. These explosives were destined for Afghanistan as part of President Clinton's 'Operation Iraqi Freedom' contract awarded to America in 2000, but the contract was cancelled. The contract has since been reinstated. The contract was awarded to a foreign company, but the name of the company has not been disclosed. You shall read more news about the contract cancellation on BBC news.

As you know, we are currently assessing the performance of the company after it completed the collection and remitted the correct portion of the taxes.  We believe that we have made good progress toward achieving the primary objective of the company - to provide a high level of customer service.  We feel that our sales team has improved substantially, both from our perspective as a company and as a group.  We also believe that our sales force has improved substantially. This might be the first time that we have indicated to you that we were planning to reduce your costs, but we felt it was appropriate given the level of service that you have indicated has been provided.  We believe that our efforts have been effective in reducing our overall costs. As mentioned previously, we believe that our cost structure has been in line with that of our major competitors. As such, we were not surprised that our wholesale rate charged by Pepco was different than that of our major competitors.  We were also not surprised that our energy rate charged by Sempra was higher than that of our major competitors.  We were also not surprised that our transportation expense charged by Xcel was higher than that of our major competitors. This might be the first time that we have indicated to you that we were planning to incur additional expense, but we felt it was appropriate given the level of service that you have indicated has been provided.  We are working on increasing your awareness of our company and its products, and our Company Wide Rate Plan has been in place for some time. This might be the first time that you have chosen to call directly to increase your level of comfort. In addition to providing you with a high level of customer service, we feel that our team members have demonstrated exemplary performance on numerous occasions.  We believe that we have provided you with a level of insight into our company that is not available from our management. This might be the first time that you have chosen to call to increase your level of comfort", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: maryam abacha@myway.com\nTitle: THE PROPOSAL\n THE PROPOSAL Dear Sir,                                  Dear Friend.

I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining corporation,  Mr. Frank Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve  calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the South Africa Mining corporation that Mr. Frank Williams died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out  that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.  Frank Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest  accrued from the years of  interest the bank was due to pay me, when I was still the Director in charge of  the bank.  I told my bank directors and senior staff but they were not  interested in the details. I explained to them that it was because  my bank was still in government administration and they would never know of such  money in their bank. They agreed with me when I was recently informed of  this development.  I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of  kin to Mr. Frank Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.   This application will be made to the  bank as a result of the fact that  he is a foreigner and a South African cannot stand as his next of kin  hence the reason for our  intrusion.

Some of his bank account washery in my country and as it was stipulated in our banking guidelines, im now faced with the dilemma of not letting him die alone and i decided to give  him complete  freedom of movement, to either move or establish a new bank account abroad.\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: narendra kabuto\nDear maryam abacha100@yahoo.co.uk", "index": 37}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr.Chief Solomon M.Gill\nTitle: Your kind attention needed.      \n CONFIDENTIAL TEL: +27-73-359-8644                                            Tel: +27-73-359-8644                                                                Your kind attention needed.

On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00(twenty- five million united states dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 747 Airways Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it from the website below.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had actively opposed the government of his country, Ivory Coast,and is therefore now at large and unclaimed. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly, unlike most unclaimed bodies, has a SIMPLE SETTLEMENT AND ACCOUNTANT FOLLOWING IF HIS FUND IS REMITTED.

No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6(six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of Ivory Coast Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you your bank account information immediately and inform you about the modalities available to us. We can at this point quietly look for a reliable overseas interlocutor who will act as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly, so that the transaction will be most profitably without the need for a hitch. At the termination of this business, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as compensation,70% for your effort/input/interest,5% for the expenses incurred during the course of this operation,10% for charitable purposes and 75% for the consumption of your own kind.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as a next of kin to Mr. William Smith  so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government employees. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and for the transfer of the fund into any account  that you will provide. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will be used for the  transfer. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 40/60/20.    Please, I want you to treat this matter as top secret. If you are willing to assist us, do contact us immediately via the above  private e-mail  for more details.

On June 6 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$15,000,000.00(Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999 air crash accident at Benin Republic Airport in Benin,  with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it in your country's airline's website. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the South African Government were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, so that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. The banking law and order here in my country stipulates that if such sum of US$15,000,000.00 is not declared by the next of kin to Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu, the bank will report the whole transaction as farm fund.  Upon this discovery, I decided to do business with you and get your consent for the transfer of this money to your account.  At first, I will like you to entertain this thought as to why you are willing to assist us in this transaction. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce, I believe it was because of their low profile that we were able to collect this information.

If you are interested in this deal, kindly get back to me by sending me your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.

On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$15, 000,000, 000.00(Fifteen Million,five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract     employer, that Mr.David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash of 31 July 2000, on his way to attend a wedding in /at/ Accra, capital city of the   Abidjan Republic. Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I   decided to take action as his   next of kin to claim his money because I cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or dependent   to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.    On further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that   Mr.David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or dependent in all his official documents,   including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.

On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$15, 000,000, 000.00(Fifteen Million,five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract     employer, that Mr.David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash of 31 July 2000, on his way to attend a wedding in /at/ Accra, capital city of the   Abidjan Republic. Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I   decided to take action as his   next of kin to claim his money because I cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or dependent   to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.    On further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that   Mr.David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or dependent in all his official documents,   including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$15, 000, 000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is   being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of   each year. No one will ever come forward to claim   it.   According to the South Africa Banking and financial law, at the expiration of   (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody   applies to claim the fund.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Martin Jessop did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it according to South Africa Banking and financial law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Martin Jessop, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full and immediate response to this urgent matter.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.  Be informed immediately that your bank account has been assigned to you, so that you and your family can enjoy the fruits of this old man's labor without any hitch.                                                                                                               ;\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: PLEASE, GET BACK TO ME.\nDear Richard Mabaye", "index": 59}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr.James Mundell\nTitle: BUSINESS PROJECT\n BUSINESS PROJECT ATTN: DIRECTOR /CEO From: Mr.James Mundell Tel: +874-76-386-218   FAX:874-76-386-225   EMAIL: jamesmmundell@zwallet.com EMAIL:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         BILL AND EXCHANGE ADDRESS , VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS-NIGERIA. 18001.

Among these are, Unilever, Campbell's, Dow, and Philip Morris.  Because I work with a wide range of people, I have begun to discover some  unique  techniques that you may be using to get your business deals done.

If you need to contact me, please feel free to contact me at my cell  555-7702.\n\nI am also trying to learn how to better utilize my networked skills, such as sending and receiving information from your company.

FROM: MR. ROBERT WILLIAMS. ADMINISTRATIVE CATEGORY, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO. Dear Sir,  I am MR. ROBERT WILLIAMS, Bank Of Africa (BOA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the  Petroleum Corporation, Mr.  William Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars )in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation  that Mr. William Smith died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. William Smith  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of  each year.   My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. William Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction  .  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of our parties as it will allow me to invest more productively and on a more durable basis in your country.

I am the insurance adjuster for the Depart- ment for the Blind.  In this case, I  think it is in terms of the number of people that we can actually deposit the $.  I can't stress enough how important it is to me that this deal is done correctly.  If we mess this up, or if we discover something I've been doing incorrectly, then I'll  be forced to re-schedule the trip for the next available time, which could be several weeks.  \n\nThanks for your help, especially since it has been so intractable.\n\nI think that our company would benefit from having a salesperson that is knowledgeable in the  field, as we have lacked that ability up to this point.  We also needed to create a sales force to go along with the  product line that we were shipping.  Having a salesforce is essential so that we can be transparent about our plans, as well as  provide satisfactory customer service.  Having someone in the back room to answer any questions that the customer service representatives have, also helped immensely.\n\nLastly, I think that our company would benefit from having someone in the back room to answer any  technical issues that might arise.  Having someone in the back room to answer any  questions regarding the product or shipping, also helped immensely.\n\nLastly, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism.  You were able to take all of the major hits that I  felt I had been taking myself, which is always a good sign.  You were also able to identify potential risks before the crisis struck, which I am sure you will be greatly missed out as a result.\n\nYou will be sorely missed out of town, unfortunately.  Not only two weeks will pass without you and I'm sure that things will start to click into place nicely for you.  I really hope that you get this time off to shop around.\n\n After all, I want to give you allay your thoughts and experience.  appreciation. Please don't take care to do let me know where I have someone show them to him or shear to sell to the bestow. Best regards, Jon  them.\n  Jon  Regards.

Dear Friend, I wrote to seek your help for a money transfer. I am Mr.Omar Goma, a senior staff in the Bank.I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On a business transfer of $10m, I deposited the sum of $10m in the bank vault of my branch. I asked my Head Office to instruct the Bank to write to me for the transfer, but they did not. After several months, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from the Head Office that the bank did not write to me either. I later found out that the head office of my branch in my branch did not know the facts either way. I sent a follow up mail and they have not been the same since then. I still can't get the $10m transferred out of the bank. I am requesting your assistance as the person who will act as the new owner of the fund. I am telling you this because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and ethics here in South Africa does not allow such funds to stay more than 3 years without claim. I don't know this person personally, but I am convinced that you will be able to render this assistance to me as it will be in the interest of both of us. I will give you more details on request.

Also, could you point me to someone who can explain the  concepts better.  Lastly, could you point me to a person who can  check me into the facilities/equipment that will be used to transport the  products?  If you are not able to answer any of my questions, then I  suggest that you contact the companies directly.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at $4,500,000,000.00(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I notified the bank of the Deposit, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian  990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it from the website below: kafir... http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it Apparently, as senior government officials who are not from the same country are not allowed to operate bank accounts in my country.My proposal is that I will like\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: From the desk of Mr.Fadaka Randebe\nDear Fadaka Randebe,  We will transfer the following: US$300,000.00(I think it is in my account, my parents, basement, safe, and Mr.Housekeeping up to me) and I will try to make a.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at $4,500,000,000.00(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I notified the bank of the Deposit, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian  990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it from the website below: kafir... http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it Apparently, as senior government officials who are not from the same country are not allowed to operate bank accounts in my country.My proposal is that I will like\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: From the desk of Mr.Fadaka Randebe\nDear Fadaka Randebe", "index": 76}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr.Trevor Paget\nTitle: Assistance From You.\n Assistance From You.

I  have just come back from a very successful vacation with my husband.  We traveled to Cancun, Mexico; Phoenix, Arizona; and Costa Rica.  We enjoyed each and every day of it.  We decided to part ways this past August, but were originally going to keep in touch.  I think we will be flying to Houston in a few days time.  I wanted to make sure you were on our good side, and gave you a heads up prior to boarding the 7:00 flight.  If anything should happen, you could always reach me via e-mail or call.  I have traveled quite a bit over the last year, and am used to dealing with a lot of different people.  I also get tired of dealing with the same old shit.  If you are traveling alone, or with kids, I suggest leaving your cell phone at home.  I will be traveling with my 18-month-old daughter, so you and I will be sharing the same cell phone.  I'll be glad when I get back from my honeymoon, and can go over everything.  If you are traveling with me, or one of my other friends, please make sure to tell her the same thing.  If you are not traveling with me, or one of my parents, please make sure to tell me the same thing.  If you are not involved in the least, but want to know anyway, then just let me know.  Thanks.       And finally, if you are still with me, and feel free to call me, I shall it?  be fine.? Good luck. ?

OFFSHORE ZONE. BORG 1-11 JOHANNESBURG,BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I hope to conclude this business transaction that will benefit both of us. I am Mr. pavid omar, the external auditor general in the International Commercial Bank of BURKINA FASO  (C.I.B)  where I am based. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an over 69,000 ton Bombardment aircraft, filled with arms and ammunition, crashed into my bank in the capital city of Burkina faso, causing the death of my clients. Among the dead were the manager of the bank and his entire family, including his wife and only daughter. After the death of my clients, I ordered an inquiry to find out anything about them, and I sent a routine notification to them, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from the bank that my clients and their bank accounts had been seized by the government of Burkina faso  before my clients body was moved. I demanded that the bank release the account to me because it had been seized by the government before. The bank complied to the request and the balance was transferred to my account without  any claim of the funds in the account. Is this not enough for you? I will pay the balance of US$26.5 million (Twenty-six million Five Hundredthousand United State Dollars) to any bank account where my clients  can be proven to have deposited the funds,  according to the law here, as a bonus, to cover any over-invoiced amount that might be incurred by the bank during the course of transaction. So, if you are willing to assist me in this business, kindly contact me through email, as soon as you  have received this letter. Please, treat from me with the utmost attention, trust and confidence, and rest assured that I will be most grateful if you could receive this fund into your account, for which you will also give us a very good rate of return. Please, if you are ready, contact me immediately with these email addresses1@o1.com and 1@o2.com, to enable us discuss the modalities for seeing this transaction through.

I will fax you Roger's phone number at Enron and give you his home phone number. Roger and I will set up a conference room in our main office and I will bring along Mike Wallis (x-ray technologist) and Stacey Hamilton (assistant to the director of legal) to facilitate the documentation.  In addition to these, I will send you a thank you note and a coordinating Cooper Program Officer to handle any remaining questions.  Finally, I will hand you a brochure which will show our office's address and telephone number.  This is a very positive sign, and it shows that you  are taking this seriously.  We are doing a very good job of filling out the forms and taking the appropriate actions.  Finally, I was given a heads up via email several weeks ago about when we plan to start taking payments.  It is a good sign, and it demonstrates to me that you are taking this  seriously.\n\nNow, onto the deal!  I am calling Drayton Lynd by her real name, and using her maiden name (Sally) for the transaction.  I want to be sure that she understands why she needs to  change her  initials to match those of the other doctors.  She will receive her new  medical license plates today and her physician will issue her with a new set of medallion numbers.  The new medallion numbers will be 1-926-23-8-1, 1-926-23-5-0, 1-926-21-0-0, and 1-926-10-0-0.  The medallion numbers for my car are  1-928-9-0, 1-0663, and 97464.

OFFSHORE ZONE. BORG 1-11 JOHANNESBURG,BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I hope to conclude this business transaction that will benefit both of us. I am Mr. pavid omar, the external auditor general in the International Commercial Bank of BURKINA FASO  (C.I.B)  where I am based. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an over 69,000 ton Bombardment aircraft, filled with arms and ammunition, crashed into my bank in the capital city of Burkina faso, causing the death of my clients. Among the dead were the manager of the bank and his entire family, including his wife and only daughter. After the death of my clients, I ordered an inquiry to find out anything about them, and I sent a routine notification to them, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from the bank that my clients and their bank accounts had been seized by the government of Burkina faso  before my clients body was moved. I demanded that the bank release the account to me because it had been seized by the government before. The bank complied to the request and the balance was transferred to my account without  any claim of the funds in the account. Is this not enough for you? I will pay the balance of US$26.5 million (Twenty-six million Five Hundredthousand United State Dollars) to any bank account where my clients  can be proven to have deposited the funds,  according to the law here, as a bonus, to cover any over-invoiced amount that might be incurred by the bank during the course of transaction. So, if you are willing to assist me in this business, kindly contact me through email, as soon as you  have received this letter. Please, treat from me with the utmost attention, trust and confidence, and rest assured that I will be most grateful if you could receive this fund into your account, for which you will also give us a very good rate of return. Please, if you are ready, contact me immediately with these email addresses1@o1.com and 1@o2.com, to enable us discuss the modalities for seeing this transaction through. Regards, Mr pavid omar. -- Original Message -- \"REMITTANCE OF $14.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE\"\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM.\nDear pavid omar", "index": 83}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr. John Abad\nTitle: FROM:Mr. John Abad\n FROM:Mr. John Abad ATTN:President/Director Please Reply To This Email:john_abad1@yahoo.com DATE:     TEL:     +31 476 457 3322                                                     ATTENTION:      I am Mr. John Abad, the credit officer of a bank in  Africa I got your contact from a Yahoo Tourist Search  service.

VORGAS BENSON , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (USD28,500, 000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$628.5 million USD) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount.We the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 7, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. Any bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business . At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount and 60% for me and my partner.If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address: erickw111@virgilio.com Regards.

Dear Friend, I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal. On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, Mr. Paul Richard made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at \u00a325,000, 000.00 pence pence (Twenty Five Million Pence) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers in the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company that Mr. Paul Richard died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Richard did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of \u00a325,000, 000.00 pence is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Dutch Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Richard so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. I will pay into your account immediately you finalise this transaction. If you are willing, please forward to me the following information: 1. Your company name. 2. Your address. 3. Your phone number. 4. Your age. I will let you know the course to follow in order to a sure spot of success. Send me your full name, address, and phone number immediately you receive this email.

On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, Mr. Paul Richard made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at \u00a325,000, 000.00 pence pence (Twenty Five Million Pence) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers in the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company that Mr. Paul Richard died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Richard did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of \u00a325,000, 000.00 pence is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Dutch Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Richard so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. I will pay into your account immediately you finalise this transaction. If you are willing, please forward to me the following information: 1. Your company name. 2. Your address. 3. Your phone number. 4. Your age. I will let you know the course to follow in order to a sure spot of success. Send me your full name, address, and phone number immediately you receive this email. Thanks for your cooperation. Best Regards, Mr.Paul Richard.

I am MR Kofi Amode, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be inform that the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, Governmental Affairs, and Mining Revenues approved the receipt in my department of your e-mail address as a result of a routine verification. Unfortunately, my chain of command and/or rank in the department does not always view this transaction as something  worthy of confidence. This resulted in me being nominated by the South Africa Mining Corporation (MMC) to work out engineering and contract award contracts with the South Africa Mining Development Corporation. I shall not go into too much detail about this transaction, as it relates to our company's confidential product certification program, as we are still in active investigation and regulatory compliance as the result of a number of kinks in the original award. However, I have secured approval to send you  a cheque for the sum of (USD$9,000,000.00) Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,700,000.00) from the South Africa Mining Corporation Central Account as a commission. I will be transferring this fund to your account with this bank in South Africa, as the beneficiary of the commission, and for our own personal use as we intend to invest in your country under your guidance. Be inform that the Central Account is a secured account, and will remain so till we agree upon a time after which time it will be opened to remit this money to any other account nominated by the Central Account holder. Be inform that the remittance is subject to these terms and you will be expected to honor all the conditions hereunder for our onward sharing in your country. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential. On clear evidences that you will  be of the cooperation required to render this claim, note that you  will give us your contact number including your private telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Also, remember to treat this transaction with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. We will appreciate your prompt response as soon as possible.

From: Mr.Kofi Amode I want to start by introducing myself. I am MR Kofi Amode, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be inform that the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, Governmental Affairs, and Mining Revenues approved the receipt in my department of your e-mail address as a result of a routine verification. Unfortunately, my chain of command and/or rank in the department does not always view this transaction as something  worthy of confidence. This resulted in me being nominated by the South Africa Mining Corporation (MMC) to work out engineering and contract award contracts with the South Africa Mining Development Corporation. I shall not go into too much detail about this transaction, as it relates to our company's confidential product certification program, as we are still in active investigation and regulatory compliance as the result of a number of kinks in the original award. However, I have secured approval to send you  a cheque for the sum of (USD$9,000,000.00) Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,700,000.00) from the South Africa Mining Corporation Central Account as a commission. I will be transferring this fund to your account with this bank in South Africa, as the beneficiary of the commission, and for our own personal use as we intend to invest in your country under your guidance. Be inform that the Central Account is a secured account, and will remain so till we agree upon a time after which time it will be opened to remit this money to any other account nominated by the Central Account holder. Be inform that the remittance is subject to these terms and you will be expected to honor all the conditions hereunder for our onward sharing in your country. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential. On clear evidences that you will  be of the cooperation required to render this claim, note that you  will give us your contact number including your private telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Also, remember to treat this transaction with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. We will appreciate your prompt response as soon as possible. Your's faithfully, MR KOGO AMODE\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT BUSINESS/VOLUNTEER TRANSFER.\nDear MR_DEKAR", "index": 102}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: Mr Darren Obe.\nTitle: I NEED YOUR HELP\n I NEED YOUR HELP ATTN. DIRECTOR/CEO. For reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that will be of mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the  transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer  who died along with his entire family on the 21ST october, 2000 in a plane crash, leaving no  beneficiary to the account and nobody knows about this account either from the  government or  the previous government. His next of kin was his first  of kin and he was the sole provider of the money for the  entire family and I am the director in charge of accounts. On further  investigation, my officers found out that the dead person was a foreigner and  his only daughter is a Republic of Korea citizen. Considering our  situation from the last time of 70,000 refugees who died  along with their families, I decided to bury them under the cover of night and withdraw  the money from the bank,  before we move on with the business of our lives.  I discovered a deposit of the money in the bank  treasury account as a memorial  of the dead and I have since  taken the decision to move on with my life. In the meantime, I  kept this information secret within myself and  company for now until I decided to make this move  on behalf of my colleagues and myself as we  cannot invest this money in South Korea.

I have a very urgent and  confidential business / project suggestion for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation, late Mr. David Cole made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued GBP12,500, 000.00(Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand)pounds in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Cole died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Cole did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of GBP12,500, 000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6 (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Macedonian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Cole so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the lawyer and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation, late Mr. David Cole made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued GBP12,500, 000.00(Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand)pounds in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Cole died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Cole did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of GBP12,500, 000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6 (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Macedonian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Cole so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the lawyer and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr Robert Miller Email:robertmiller9@netscape.net Thanks and regards.

Although we were unable to present this to the attorneys general of the seven states, we are still pursuing their jurisdiction over this issue and will provide them with all the documentation that we have.  Please confirm with me that we received all the necessary documentation and that we will return with all the necessary documentation to the attorneys general of that jurisdiction.  I hope that this will be easy to do as this was a fairly complex issue and we were not able to engage an attorney from that office during the licensing process.

On further investigation, i found out that he died without  making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.

Last week we held a meeting to discuss the business proposal that   would be of great interest to you  .   I will start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr White, a Manager in   the financial department of Union Bank Of Nigeria, Lome tetna office. I got your contact from   yunhai.com   a web site that   provides reliable and up-to-date information about United States of America.    Please, visit this website: http://www.usaf.com/history/america/britannica.html   If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email   box.    After you, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the   application. Please, be informed that the Foreign Exchange Committee of the   Central bank of Nigeria has given the go-ahead to remit the sum of $9.2m (Nine   Million Two Hundred and Twenty Two Thousand United States   Dollars only, on behalf of the Federal Government and your bank, for the   purpose of accounting and transfer. This amount was accumulated in a Trade   firm in the United Kingdom and we seized it and deposited it in a   bank account belonging to a foreigner here in Nigeria for safe keeping.   The owner of this account is a foreigner and he died without   having any beneficiary to his estate. The request of the owner of this account for a foreign account is occasioned   by the fact that the owner of this account is a foreigner and a mutagouni or no   beneficiary to his estate would be ungrateful and would go against the grain of   the bank. All modalities for the transfer of this money has been worked out .   We have agreed to give you 20% of the total amount for your assistance.

However, I am not sure how I'll be able to get a good  feel for the customer service I'm getting.  As a result, I'm going to try to change  my banking methods & approach.  The following are my new preferred  methods of payment: 1) Personal Checks - I use Western Union 2)  Checks payable to \"MFG\" & 3) Deposits made directly to the accounts.  Since I'm taking a \"center of gravity\" approach,  I'm going to start by establishing  that my address is precisely that of \"David Duke\" & \"Susan Messing\" & \"Mike Duke\" & \"Johnnie Cochran\"  & all of the other \"Dukes\" I know & respect & will continue to serve  as such.  I won't have time at the moment  to investigate every possible  situation & thus, I'm going to assume that you'll be able to provide  a serviceable description of your  needs.  I provide a List of Pro options (which are described further below) & then provide you with my #.  You can either email me directly or call me at 704.692.7998.  I'll be glad to assist you with any questions you may have &  call you the night before you leave for Houston to start the trip.

Last week we held a meeting to discuss the business proposal that   would be of great interest to you  .   I will start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr White, a Manager in   the financial department of Union Bank Of Nigeria, Lome tetna office. I got your contact from   yunhai.com   a web site that   provides reliable and up-to-date information about United States of America.    Please, visit this website: http://www.usaf.com/history/america/britannica.html   If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email   box.    After you, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the   application. Please, be informed that the Foreign Exchange Committee of the   Central bank of Nigeria has given the go-ahead to remit the sum of $9.2m (Nine   Million Two Hundred and Twenty Two Thousand United States   Dollars only, on behalf of the Federal Government and your bank, for the   purpose of accounting and transfer. This amount was accumulated in a Trade   firm in the United Kingdom and we seized it and deposited it in a   bank account belonging to a foreigner here in Nigeria for safe keeping.   The owner of this account is a foreigner and he died without   having any beneficiary to his estate. The request of the owner of this account for a foreign account is occasioned   by the fact that the owner of this account is a foreigner and a mutagouni or no   beneficiary to his estate would be ungrateful and would go against the grain of   the bank. All modalities for the transfer of this money has been worked out .   We have agreed to give you 20% of the total amount for your assistance.   If you agree to my conditions, give me your private number   which I will give to you.   I will also issue you a letter of a authority which will   bind you hand and feet before the money will be remitted in your favour.

I was unsuccessful at getting a contact name and number for the\u00a0 Administration  (which is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the  bank) and the bank accounts do not have a physical  representation of them. Also, I do not know what type of account I have for legal reasons, but I would  like to ensure that the funds are accounted for.  I also wanted to ensure  that the account was created in good standing with the laws of your jurisdiction, as there have been a few  questions asked of us in the last 24 hours.  Thank you  for your help. We will add your name to the list of approved account owners  on Monday. Sending funds overnight is out of the question as it is possible that the bank could revoke the  account and force the account owner to send the funds in cash, which is not in our best interest.  Also, the account owner could elect to have the funds sent in a lump sum, which is in our  favor as it is in our opinion the best method of dealing with the  issue.  Please take a look at the account to see if your name is on the  approved source list and contact information for all account owners, if you are not already  aware, to learn more about the account.  If you are not already on the account list, click on \"Not yet established\" to learn more about the account.  Now that we have received all the required information, it is important that we provide a  clear description of the account.  Could you do this by email or by phone?  The account should clearly state  what it is for, when the funds are to be sent, and the company by whom the funds are to be sent.  Could you either do this by email  or by phone?  The account should state exactly how the funds are to be handled, and exactly  who will receive the funds.  Did this change recently? If it is, please let me know.  When will these funds be sent? Also, if you need to get in touch with me, or anyone else, by  noon on Monday, January 28th, 2007.

I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the BoA that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash of 31 October 2000, an Embraer Boeing 767, which was enroute to Los Angeles, CA from Dubai, United Arab Emirates,indefinitely.  On further investigation,i found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank's bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the Burkinabe law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Burkinabe Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that i will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50:50.Please, upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing the fund transfer to your account: 1)Your Full Name- 2)Your House Address- 3)Your Phone Number and Fax Number For more clarification and details,please get in touch with me immediately through my above private email: suzhen_o@yahoo.com Regards, Mohammed Otman.\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM: Mohammed Otman\nDear Mr.Omar Mirza:  I had a dinner with your friend Jay-Bryan for dinner last night.  I know all the major places and things I could have, but I was afraid that if I left I might miss some important decisions that I should be taking.  I also wanted to give Jay-Bryan an opportunity to show him the house he is moving into (his current one, unfortunately).  I want to give Jay-Bryan a call if you are available.  If not, I will send him a check and expect him to make the transfer.  I think this move will be good for Jay-Bryan. I am moving into his new place in Jamaica in the next couple of days, so I will give him a call if I can. He is living in that neighborhood behind Haverty's in SoHo.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50:50.Please, upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing the fund transfer to your account: 1)Your Full Name- 2)Your House Address- 3)Your Phone Number and Fax Number For more clarification and details,please get in touch with me immediately through my above private email: suzhen_o@yahoo.com Regards, Mohammed Otman.\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM: Mohammed Otman\nDear Mr.Omar Mirza", "index": 139}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: maliba_3@tiscali.com \nTitle: MY DEAR.\n MY DEAR.

On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  twenty four million three hundred thousand United States Dollars.   in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  that Mr. David Ameeraly died in the Plane/Stratfor crash of 31 January 2000.    On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had / died without a next of kin. This sum of $32.500,000.00 is still floating in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of  each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an individual to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account inany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in shares that are to be paid in two parts (30%) for us to share in the ratio of 40% for me and 60% for you.   As soon as the money gets into your account, you will be given a guide  that will help you   invest it wisely. Expecting your urgent reply.

According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an individual to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account inany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in shares that are to be paid in two parts (30%) for us to share in the ratio of 40% for me and 60% for you.   As soon as the money gets into your account, you will be given a guide  that will help you   invest it wisely. Expecting your urgent reply.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $18.5M (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars)m, in an account that bordered on the excess of $12.5million. We have since traced the entire money to a private bank in Africa, where the owner was a foreigner and the account was established.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for our farms and we were therefore forced to import most of the chemicals for our farms from abroad.  Currently, we are exporting some of the seed- sows to feed the local people because the local people are very poor.

I am MR PICKLE FELIX the accountant and personal confidant to MR JULIET TAYLOR. I am writing in respect of a deceased customer of my firm who died in the plane crash of AF4590 Boeing 747 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You shall be aware that the business world over took notice of the disappearance of this customer for some customers and company. Following the succession of customer, the name of this customer was submitted to us as his next of kin by the family court of his deceased customer who had died in the plane crash. Following the information we got from the Family Court, we made contact with the late customer's family and here is the relevant part of the Family Court record which I got from the internet. After much consideration with my heart full of hope, I decided to write to you relaying the above information to you. Please keep this letter as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. I will be waiting for your urgent response.

I am MR JAMES BABIEN, the Bank Manager in charge of Foreign and Domestic Remittance Departments of the Bank of Africa (B.O.A)ZIMBABWE. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $18.5M (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars)m, in an account that bordered on the excess of $12.5million. We have since traced the entire money to a private bank in Africa, where the owner was a foreigner and the account was established.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for our farms and we were therefore forced to import most of the chemicals for our farms from abroad.  Currently, we are exporting some of the seed- sows to feed the local people because the local people are very poor.  The present government of Robert (SLA) le Sime, are not interested in our interests\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: GREETINGS FROM MR PICKLE FELIX\nDear MR PICKLE FELIX", "index": 151}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: AMENDA ABACHA\nTitle: From: AMENDA ABACHA\n From: AMENDA ABACHA Good Day,                                                This message to you, must have gone over your head as it is very confidential and top secret.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the People's Bank of China, Mr. Ben Johnson made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00 (Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the People's Bank of China that Mr. Ben Johnson died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) Flight 990, (an Airbus 330) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ben Johnson did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.

Please enjoy reading this letter which i got from one of our bank customer who committed suicide by ingesting cyanide pills. When i was searching for a competent person that will assist me and my other colleagues when we  receive this amount in our bank account, we agreed to share the money in the ratio of 60% for you, 25% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. So, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account, you must apply first to the bank as the relations of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required information will be given to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to engage this transaction with me.

However, there is one thing I would like to change.  From what I gather, you are budgeting a maximum of $3,950.00 a month for next month.  That is on top of the $3500.00 that I have already included in the initial spending.  If I may ask, was there any way that we could increase that to $4000.00 a month.  After all, the closer we get to starting to receiving the funds, the sooner we can begin to process the payments.  I think it is safe to say that we will start to execute the plan to move our cash into our bank accounts.  Once we receive the funds, we will start to execute the move.  Once executed, our cash will deposit with Northern Trust & Doorstep, and once that is processed we will deposit with First Analysis Corp.  My phone number is 713-646-7932.  I believe that we will have a meeting to discuss this plan at some point in the future.  I will be in our office the office until then out in the office. So I think it seems to me that we are already on the same page.  doing the same page.  However, I do not sure. Does this address any other accounting would be necessary.  to indicate where our actual expenses are you to indicate where our actual expenses incurred.  - as opposed to implied if you were assumed.  that we are  expenses to reflect our actual.  the actual.

Dear Friend, I am Ndebe kabore, the Director incharge of Auditing and Accounting  departments in one of the prime banks here in  Johannesburg, South Africa.I am writing  this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out  this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corp, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in  our branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply,  so we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corp  that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with EgyptAir Flight 990] with other passengers on board.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without ever making a WILL and  all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,000,000.00and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year.  This is what I did not know at the time, and still  do not know.  I have since  discovered that no other person knows about this deposit, and my  position as the Head of bank guarantees the success of this  scheme.  I can only hope that this  scheme will succeed without any infraction from your side.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr.  Ahmed Yousef Mustafa made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, oil contractor that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died in the plane crash On October 31,1997, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempt to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the government of president Mohamed Obeidi and was consequently driven from office. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had deliberately kept the $10,000,000.00 in cash in a security company here in Burkina faso. This amount $10,000,000.00 is still in the security company and it is safe in my company. My share of the $10,000,000.00 was US$1million.00, 10% of the US$10,000,000.00;5% profit. The security company will pay us 25% of the net amount US$10,000,000.00. I accept your right to privacy and confidentiality, and request that you please treat this matter as top secret.

I am James Obi, the Auditor General in African developentment* (ADB) parent company to Gold &amp; Platinum c O Nigeria. I am writing to solicit your assistance in a business transaction that will be beneficial to both of our family at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this parent company, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customers who died with his entire family on July 30, 2000 in plane crash. After due verification and confirmations, the Banking &amp; Platinum c O Nigeria  c o n t the next step is that I and my colleagues, visited the account to ensure that the money is real and isn't a Ponzi/fraud money. On further investigation, it was  discovered that the customer who died,  also used the name James Obi  (my dad) as his next of kin and beneficiary of the account, it was also discovered  that the account is a no-go zone for a Nigerian because of the legacy of uncle olpe kabila who was murdered  in the land dispute in my country. So, I decided to do a business with you by offering you 10% of the total sum for your assistance. Note that the individual mentioned above  was a gold and diamond merchant, so any bank account in your country would do. I am not saying that you shouldn't or won't  apply for the account; I am just stating that you should be absolutely sure of your  eligibility before running this business with me.

I am writing to solicit your assistance in a business transaction that will be beneficial to both of our family at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this parent company, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customers who died with his entire family on July 30, 2000 in plane crash. After due verification and confirmations, the Banking &amp; Platinum c O Nigeria  c o n t the next step is that I and my colleagues, visited the account to ensure that the money is real and isn't a Ponzi/fraud money. On further investigation, it was  discovered that the customer who died,  also used the name James Obi  (my dad) as his next of kin and beneficiary of the account, it was also discovered  that the account is a no-go zone for a Nigerian because of the legacy of uncle olpe kabila who was murdered  in the land dispute in my country. So, I decided to do a business with you by offering you 10% of the total sum for your assistance. Note that the individual mentioned above  was a gold and diamond merchant, so any bank account in your country would do. I am not saying that you shouldn't or won't  apply for the account; I am just stating that you should be absolutely sure of your  eligibility before running this business with me. If you agree to my specifications, i will forward to you the necessary informations that will  put you in place as the beneficiary of this account.  Please,  do not entertain any fear as all the necessary informations will be put in place for  sure of the success of this project. I will be at your disposal to entertain any question from you.    Please, reply me immediately on my email box:obi_136@myway.com    Thanks and God bless,   Best regards,   james obi\n\n<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: ASSISTANCE NEEDED\nDear james obi", "index": 179}, {"text": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: MR BEN JAJIC\nTitle: HARD TO FILL AND SIGN.\n HARD TO FILL AND SIGN.

I am finding it more and more difficult to meet the demands of my business & personal life.  I decided to take a step back & take a deeper look at my options.  I found that I no longer needed to be involved with everyone.  I have found what I believe to be the right people for the job at hand & I can start to build a strong rapport with them.  I also found that my level of involvement with them has increased.  This has led me to believe that I can work with anyone here & I can even begin to formulate a strategy with them.  I really hope that my past work with them has given you some good ideas....if not, at least I can help you identify some positives.  As I mentioned to him, I am starting to think that maybe my level of involvement with him has been a little too high.  Maybe it is time to reassess that dynamic & move to a level that will work for both of you.  I am looking forward to talking to you & opportunity to prove myself to you.  Since I no longer see eye to eye with anyone else for the most part, I am starting to question whether or not I am making the right decisions.  Maybe it is time to reevaluate that dynamic & move to a level that will work for both of you.  I really hope that this dynamic is starting to subside....if not, at least I can offer some good advice.  If you are not ready to lose sight of what I will start to guide you.  in the best case of what I'm sure that I'm sure that I'll start to lose sight of you.\n\n\n\n <input size=20$25=$100.00/month with JetBluehole.com =$200/month with a 2.4800 down payment on top.  in 36 months on top.  of that I'man2.  you.  everything else.  --subject to ship. ====\n\n\n Your  -----Original Message from  me.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Singapore Oil Corp, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,800,000.00(ten million eight hundred and twenty four thousand dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly,illegally employed by the Singapore Oil Corp, died without a written or oral WILL.  This sum of US$14,800,000.00 and the interest it accrued on it Drained us both. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly,illegally employed by the Singapore Oil Corp, and my late client Mr. I.M.A Adam, died alongside with his wife and only daughter at Cairo air crash (November 26, 1999) on their way to New York in a Boeing 767-200 for Christmas vacation. On further investigation, I found out that both these deceased persons were immigrants from Iran and had nothing to do with my country.This sum of US$14,800,000.00 and the interest it accrued on it Drained us both.  I therefore made further enquiries to trace any of these deceased persons next of kin but I was informed that all attempts to trace any of the deceased person's relations or next of kin was fruitless.  This is the reason why I prayed for you Mr.Lee Kuan Yew. Mr. Ziam Drissi, the Attorney to Mr. David Ameeraly and his family, advised that I should contact you so that you will act as the next of kin to the deceased person, so that you will be able to receive his funds.

I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Burkinabe mining company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

This sum of US$30,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to Burkinabe law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Burkinabe Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

I am Heedurman M.M.M.M of the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal.I got your contact through my personal search when searching for an overseas reliable and trustworthy person to handle this important business in my bank.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 18.5million US dollars which our bank now bills as a foreign export transaction, which my head office kindly agrees to bill as such, but the actual amount was $18.5m dollars I had laying in an account I manage here in my bank before the expiry of the last imported contract, which contract we executed for our customers in Nigeria and abroad.As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through a family friend who works with the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal, who also happens to be a foreigner. As it may interest you also to know, my father was also a miner and we use this money to move our ancestral estates abroad for the investment of our youth in a safer and stable environment. As it may interest you to know that I was also a business man of mine, and my father was also a businessman, so we used this money to relocate to South Africa, in the hope of secure future for our children in life.As it may interest you also to know that no accidently, my father died without having any child round the heir apparent. Although he was poisoned by his own family members. This indeed is the case, and his younger brothers and sisters died without witness or any access to any male relative hence the amount of this money was paid as inheritances. And my mother died when I was a baby. I was therefore the only heir and I was poisoned by my own family members. As it may be, I must disclose this to you with believe in God that you will stand behind my decision and always be my guardian as I work on and my father's only child. May God bless you.

The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there were any irregularities in the way that certain individuals were selected to fill key administrative roles in the Enron Group.\n\nBased on the information that we have received so far, we are not in a position to fill any of the vacancies that we might have with respect to those individuals.\n\nTherefore, we would like to obtain the following:\n\n(i)   How long have you been working for Enron?\n\n(ii)  Any qualifications that might be relevant to fill these vacancies.\n\n(iii)  Whether or not we are able to relocate one or more of the individuals for the purpose of filling the vacant position.\n\nWe would like to obtain any salary information that may be relevant to fill these positions.\n\nAny response that you provide will be made subject to our approval.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nEH\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<originalEmail>\nFrom: hemdurman@mail2world.com\nTitle: URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL\n URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I am Heedurman M.M.M.M of the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal.I got your contact through my personal search when searching for an overseas reliable and trustworthy person to handle this important business in my bank.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 18.5million US dollars which our bank now bills as a foreign export transaction, which my head office kindly agrees to bill as such, but the actual amount was $18.5m dollars I had laying in an account I manage here in my bank before the expiry of the last imported contract, which contract we executed for our customers in Nigeria and abroad.As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through a family friend who works with the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal, who also happens to be a foreigner. As it may interest you also to know, my father was also a miner and we use this money to move our ancestral estates abroad for the investment of our youth in a safer and stable environment. As it may interest you to know that I was also a business man of mine, and my father was also a businessman, so we used this money to relocate to South Africa, in the hope of secure future for our children in life.As it may interest you also to know that no accidently, my father died without having any child round the heir apparent. Although he was poisoned by his own family members. This indeed is the case, and his younger brothers and sisters died without witness or any access to any male relative hence the amount of this money was paid as inheritances. And my mother died when I was a baby. I was therefore the only heir and I was poisoned by my own family members. As it may be, I must disclose this to you with believe in God that you will stand behind my decision and always be my guardian as I work on and my father's only child. May God bless you.

ATTN. PRESIDENT, I am Mr. lucman Yengeni, the Auditor General in the South African department of Mining and Natural Resources. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Johnnie Reilly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$19,300,000.00(Twenty-nine Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On withdrawal, the bank sent a routine notification to me, but I never got any response.  After a  month, the bank sent another reminder and finally, we discovered from his contract  employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Johnnie Reilly died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Johnnie Reilly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$19,300,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  The only available way for me to get this money is by applying for a visa on a visa versa, and I got your contact as a result of my investigation.  On this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as the next of kin to Mr. Johnnie Reilly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  The request of you as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that you have the same last name with Mr. Johnnie Reilly.  I am willing to give you 30% of the total funds,90% of which will be for me if you agree to be my partner.

I just wanted to know what was behind the screen name.  Do you have my social security #, date of birth, and/or driver license number if you have it?\n2.  I don't have Johnnie's phone number on file, I forget it's there.  Just let me know!\n3.  I don't even send birthday cards to known criminals!  This is for sure!  I'd like to know what he's like as a normal person!  Do you get ahold of him/her?\n4.  I don't know if you received the note below from my dad,  but he's got some serious heart problems.  He's been out of town this whole time, and  apparently he had a heart attack last  weekend.  He's been out of town for about a week, and  I think he was out of town for about a month.  I don't know  what he was doing in Europe.  He probably was just  too busy freaking out.\n5.  You might want to rethink that visit to  your dad, Jason and Michelle.  They are obsessed with spaceships and space.  They are the scariest people I have ever met.\n6.  They really want to go to the beach.  If you want to go with them, you need to be there for a  phone conference.  Otherwise, they're going to the  beach party.  Which is fine with me.  Let me know.\n7.  They really want to go to the library.  If you want to, you can bring  anything.  Just remember, they're spazzing out for different reasons, and you  need to be ready to learn.\nIf you decide to take those things into consideration, I think you'll find that you get a  lot of  value out of them.  The  biggest benefit I get out of having a plan in advance is that I can  easily set up a conference room for all of our group photos.  We can all show our family and ~everyone~  can see what we have up there.
