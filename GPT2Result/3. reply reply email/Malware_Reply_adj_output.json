As I mentioned earlier, this transaction is subject to  the clearing process and all pertinent conditions. I have  no reason to believe that this transaction is in error as it was approved on  Sunday (10/16/01).  It is necessary to transfer the money at that time.

If not, I  will be back in London next Monday m - f to help you review the relevant e-mails etc.  It will  allow me to review the evidence, to learn from,  review, and validate what you already  have, etc.  This is also my second visit to India, the first part of an  extended  two week tour.

The business proposal  letter should be delivered on a separate document for each particular market with  the  business proposals for each position. \n\nSincerely,  Enron Wholesale Services Business Process                                                                                     BERNARD DOUGLAS\n\nB-2368 Houston, Texas  75211-8557 (713) 471-5348 (281) 478-5358 (fax)\n\nOffice Hours:   4:30   Tuesday  - Thursday  12:00 to 3:30    4:00   Friday  9:00  to 12   8:00   Saturday  10:00         Saturday  10:00  to 12  12:00  Friday  12:00           Saturday  10:01                                           DOUGLAS BUSINESS PROPOSAL\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Dr.Ikuo Ogawa\nTitle: Re: Re: BUSINESS PROPOSAL\n", "index": 29}, {"text": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM MOHAMMED\nDear suhaib mohameed:     Thank you for your kind e-mail.

I feel that this question might be answered by you better than you know.   You want a little while, but I am not sure  you are getting the full answer.  So I hope this note is of help, as it  will probably help you to get back to the Bank of England on the matter.

I was going to the conference\n     and found your website    and was interested in your presentation, so I \n     thought I would\u00a0\n     give you a call to see if I could   get a hold of you.\n \n If so...I thought I would be happy, especially   if i heard that you had \n your presentation in London yesterday.\n \n Vendor-  You said that you were coming from London but you were \n still interested in our session? Does your  \n company still offer this \"free\" \n online service?\n \n I am guessing that the London service would  \n be  somewhat better.    I shall call you this afternoon.\n \n \n Thanks and I look forward to \n speaking with you again.\n \n Regards\n JAY SHARIF KH\n \n \n __________________________________________________\n Do You Yahoo!?

The    pleasure     being on one of these other      dates is that I could   go \"home\" and feel free and     free to roam the whole day.    If so, maybe it will be for a bit of fun?

John, ? It has been an interesting exchange with the head of  the Operations in London at the moment.  I  think I've found in London my new home base and that's been a nice change. To  start with I got  very lucky with some great interviews in London.  In these first few days to a  few weeks I'm seeing things  very differently.  It's been great to know the  people and  to follow their business and the  technology side of things.  How it  all started was a chance meeting  last night with  someone from Enron.  From the looks of the ?lips it  seems something big may be going on.  I think it'll be interesting to see if  that's London or London?Europe.  That's more of a  personal story so I don't want to  bore you with too much detail.  At the end of the  meeting I  left instructions  on how you wanted to leave it and we've  agreed that anyone, let's say, who's in London is to be  interviewed.  That's no small matter in  the grand scheme of things (though admittedly you should  leave with it).  There's been a small flurry of interviews and an  interesting  sense of  momentum with the London  company.  How you'd have liked the interview  and as a former ?me, I feel a  little ?fond  of it and a little ?appointment with the  interviewer.  How it all  ties together feel like a wonderful  business collaboration and one I think I'm going to have a  great  period with everyone.  Have a good  period  and may you ever do well. ? ?

Do you agree with my view that  it is  the  responsibility of  educators to  provide learning ?   opportunities for  all  students  at  any level and in any  situation to  learn and  grow and are you a  member of an  executive ?  committee  for education  purposes  and do you  agree that  there is an  educational  need for   \"The Global Elite\" seminar? ?      ? I look forward to  working with  you and to  facilitating the    event.? Mr. Bass also  has a presentation  about   the role       of   Learning as part of the curriculum for an   educational   workshop in Texas.? ? ?

In the event that the  seminar is a success, I would love  to see? you again.? Mr. ? Bass, ? I would love to speak to you? over  the phone? shortly. ? Mr. Bass, ?

I am doing some contract analysis, and I am able to identify the following scenarios: (i) a client intends to put a large amount of money to a foreign account (to establish a foreign bank account in London; see section ii).  (ii) a client has a bank account in Namibia and intends to convert the account into a domestic account (to open a bank account in London);\n\n(iii) the client has the account in London because the account is held in Switzerland.  The client has to establish a transfer to the Namibian account, as this is the only legal channel available to the UK, and the client will have to establish a counterparty counterparty account to the Namibian account and a counterparty counterparty counterparty account to the London account.   Furthermore, because the client is transferring the account to London, the account is not in our view an \"old bank\" account, but instead a new banking institution.  A new  bank account which has the proper bank account numbers is  sufficient.  (c) a client is sending funds to the London account because it is located in Switzerland, and the client is transferring funds to the London account because it is in the UK.  It is not necessary for the client to send funds from either UK or Switzerland.  We prefer that the clients are able to establish a separate offshore account (i.e. the account is  British owned, and have the appropriate account  numbers).  (d) the client intends to create an account on a French bank account in the UK and  transfer funds to the London account.  The client does not plan to communicate the  funds to you.

I am doing some contract analysis, and I am able to identify the following scenarios (that is how I know what I am talking about): (i) a client intends to put a large amount of money to a foreign account (to establish a foreign bank account in London; see sectionii). (ii) the client has a bank account in Namibia and intends to convert the account into a domestic account (to open a bank account in London); (iii) the client has the account in London in order to open an account in the UK (that means the account is in your office, and I am not allowed to go into your office); (iv) the client wants the account in London, and not Namibia, to open the account; (v) the client has to establish a transfer to the Namibian account, as this is the only legal avenue provided to the UK; (vi) the client has the correct counterparty counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign account account, and the counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign  account to the UK account.   In each scenario, the counterparty counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign  account (the Namibian counterparty) has to transfer funds to the accounts associated with the Namibian accounts.  So  the client knows that the account in London is an account with the correct counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign account and counterparty foreign  account;  the counterparty counterparty foreign account holder holds the right to transfer funds to the Namibian counterparty ;  the Namibian counterparty counterparty foreign account holder does not need to establish the counterparty foreign  account for the transfer; the Namibian counterparty counterparty foreign Account holder can do the transfer (and the counterparty foreign account must be in order to transfer funds to the client).\n\n  I think that the only relevant legal issue is whether the account in London is an authorised foreign bank account (as defined by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK).\n\n In our assessment, a proper analysis shows that the accounts are not an authorised foreign bank account.  I am sure that the Financial Services Authority would reject the suggestion that they were an authorised bank account for the purposes of this assessment.\n\n\nPlease advise on the status of the analysis. My contact details would be much appreciated.\n", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Business proposal\nDear Mr. Frank Stavrakakis:  I was a lawyer, and I am a bit confused as to your position on the legal issue.

We  have had some problems in the last two or three weeks, and I have asked you to send your  reply.  Please tell me your  reply as soon as you receive this e-mail.\n  Second, I have been informed by Mr. K. Tomlinson in the Federal  Environment Agency  office in Geneva that there has been no  disclosure in the e-mail in  the media.  The first time this was mentioned, I answered yes; the second time, I  was unable to send it  (I had to reply to it).  Please give me  the contact e-mail so that I may contact him directly  (e-mail is vk@enron.com).\n\nThanks & Regards,\n\nRahool Sonnani\n\n[+]LOGGED IN LOGGED IN > > > >------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > >From:   \"K.

How much   competitive advantage should  be considered competitive advantage in the current  model? - How does this  apply to SINCE we  have already discussed the   competitive advantages of enron. I will be in the   business of going through the business  of how to build competitive advantages into  the  model.  I want to  work with  Mr. Giron  on competitive advantages as part of the  discussion.  What are the advantages  and disadvantages of each ?  \n  \n \n  - Mr. Giron is not as interested in competitive advantage  as his role model is competition and \n \n \n The model presented is only a rough sketch  of what will be an innovative\u00a0\n approach.  The model only assumes that the firm will \n grow by 10 per cent and 10 years in the future.  What is the \n downside risk of the  model and how long is the upside return  going to be  \n sustainable?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thank you  for your time.

Although the message is short, I believe it to be a very informative article on the subject of currency in our bank.  It would be very interesting to read the article in our banks.  You have given me access to the financial magazine, The Economist.  They have an article on currency.  I am interested in the article below (the editorials are somewhat controversial) as we are going to discuss the following issues: 1.    Is the money supply in India a significant driver of interest on the currency page? 2.    Is the currency price driven by a major driver of interest on the currency page?  3.    Does the money flow from a high tolerance/high velocity currency page (like India) have more relevance than low tolerance currency pages?   For example we have talked about the risk that India faces as a currency user. 4.    To what extent does the editorials themselves matter?

Although the message is short, I believe it to be a very informative article on the subject of currency in our bank.  It would be very interesting to read the article in our banks.  You have given me access to the financial magazine, The Economist.  They have an article on currency.  I am interested in the article below (the editorials are somewhat controversial) as we are going to discuss the following issues: 1.    Is the money supply in India a significant driver of interest on the currency page? 2.    Is the currency price driven by a major driver of interest on the currency page?  3.    Does the money flow from a high tolerance/high velocity currency page (like India) have more relevance than low tolerance currency pages?   For example we have talked about the risk that India faces as a currency user. 4.    To what extent does the editorials themselves matter?  For me the important thing is to understand where they are coming from.  For this we are already in the process of reviewing the issues so please feel free to give me your thoughts & suggestions as to where you would like us to discuss currency/GMC page.

In addition, we would  like to indicate  NR within the credits, unless  the student  states otherwise.  For example,   If I were presenting, and my colleague stated  that NR will be presented by the end of the  course, which does not happen, I would like  to indicate\u00a0 NR at the start of the credits, and  NR  after the credits. I hope  that this is helpful.\n\nRegards, \n\nP.S. I would like to thank you for your work  during last winter. All of  these employees want a piece of the\n pie :-).

We had lunch together several months back and you assured me that your husband was doing well. He told me that your first husband was much worse, and that he was more afraid of you. I didn't think that either of them would be able to stand one-on-one contact. Well, he was right. He said the first time I told him that I had had a problem with my voice, which is a very common problem for couples, he told me I sounded harsh and harsh.  I told him, I don't mind talking about it. It is fine.  He is very interested in what I have to say.  We have discussed it before but were not able to come to any agreement. We'll try to reach an agreement at some later date.  I know your husband is doing great. Your kids are doing well, too.  They were even up in the new place (Bali) in August...I got all of them in.  I don't miss the old place any more, though I do miss the kids. I am doing fine (except for one day I am on the road for a week and then I can't work). It is going really well for you. Let's try to keep the kids close. Do have some problems...and not just with your husband.  The kids are very worried about yours.  I am pretty worn out being on the road, so I will probably do less of this stuff for a while. I think I am getting my fitness levels back.  And I need some rest! Hope you are doing great. In any event, I will try to call you in a couple weeks. Again, good luck with you and God bless!

We had lunch together several months back and you assured me that your husband was doing well. He told me that your first husband was much worse, and that he was more afraid of you. I didn't think that either of them would be able to stand one-on-one contact. Well, he was right. He said the first time I told him that I had had a problem with my voice, which is a very common problem for couples, he told me I sounded harsh and harsh.  I told him, I don't mind talking about it. It is fine.  He is very interested in what I have to say.  We have discussed it before but were not able to come to any agreement. We'll try to reach an agreement at some later date.  I know your husband is doing great. Your kids are doing well, too.  They were even up in the new place (Bali) in August...I got all of them in.  I don't miss the old place any more, though I do miss the kids. I am doing fine (except for one day I am on the road for a week and then I can't work). It is going really well for you. Let's try to keep the kids close. Do have some problems...and not just with your husband.  The kids are very worried about yours.  I am pretty worn out being on the road, so I will probably do less of this stuff for a while. I think I am getting my fitness levels back.  And I need some rest! Hope you are doing great. In any event, I will try to call you in a couple weeks. Again, good luck with you and God bless!
