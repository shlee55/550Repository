That is fine with me.  I will cal you and send you the resume of Ed Merman.   Ed Merman was a partner at Enron North America Corp.  from Jan 1, 2001 to the present.

He had previously held various\u00a0 administrative\u00a0 positions with the Departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce.  He had also spent some time in the private sector.  He was a\u00a0 manager and chief operating officer of a large transportation company.  He was also a manager and one-time director of several other large companies.  He was highly regarded within his own group. (And rightfully so.)  He will be missed.  But most of all, I'm excited to share\u00a0 information with you.  This will definitely be a group effort.  I'm sure you will all be joining forces to do this for him.  I'll be continuing my search for a new office in Houston with Ed and will make myself available for a call if you would like to do the same for Williams.   I've asked Jeff Williams to start going over all the new group's procedures with me so that we have a plan in case something should happen.  We will also need to get the accounts signed up on all the new group memberships to make sure that they are getting the correct amount of \"free trade in.\"  We will get this all figured out in the next couple of days so we can start the actual shopping.\n\nOnce we are all set, it is time to get to the stores.  Amy and I will be heading over there as Project Managers for the newly created Northwest Shoppe, and Brian will be taking care of the Midwest sites.

My name is Chris Germany.  I work at Enron North America Corp.  in Houston.  My phone number is 713-837-2274.  I have in effect where I work.  I will sub at Enron North America Corp.  on July 1.  That is fine with me.  I will cal you and send you the resume of Ed Merman.   Ed Merman was a partner at Enron North America Corp.  from Jan 1, 2001 to the present.  He had previously worked for Williams & Connolly.  Chris Germany                           from 1984 to the present.  He had previously held various\u00a0 administrative\u00a0 positions with the Departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce.  He had also spent some time in the private sector.  He was a\u00a0 manager and chief operating officer of a large transportation company.  He was also a manager and one-time director of several other large companies.  He was highly regarded within his own group. (And rightfully so.)  He will be missed.  But most of all, I'm excited to share\u00a0 information with you.  This will definitely be a group effort.  I'm sure you will all be joining forces to do this for him.  I'll be continuing my search for a new office in Houston with Ed and will make myself available for a call if you would like to do the same for Williams.   I've asked Jeff Williams to start going over all the new group's procedures with me so that we have a plan in case something should happen.  We will also need to get the accounts signed up on all the new group memberships to make sure that they are getting the correct amount of \"free trade in.\"  We will get this all figured out in the next couple of days so we can start the actual shopping.\n\nOnce we are all set, it is time to get to the stores.  Amy and I will be heading over there as Project Managers for the newly created Northwest Shoppe, and Brian will be taking care of the Midwest sites.  He will also be taking care of the import/export of the items for our domestic sites. Let me know if you have any questions.  Also, I need to contact David Williams for our gas supply needs.  He is at 713-837-2274 for our gas purchase\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Mrs.Mabel Barry.\nTitle: Re: Re:  FROM MRS MABEL BENNIFUL.\n", "index": 15}, {"text": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE\nDear mariam amin Shirazi, I am at the end of my rope.

I have a group of people that would like to get a feel for the energy market before doing any trading.  I would like to do something along the lines of:\n\n1.  Allow persons not connected with us to trade on our books with our\u00a0 Enron counterpart.\n\n2.  Allow our traders to earn the revenue they need to operate by setting\u00a0 Rates with our neighboring companies.\n\n3.  Allow us to determine when our time is best to trade.\n\nI would like to be involved in all three of these things for two reasons:\n\n1.  I think we have done well so far.\n\n2.  We think our trading is best suited for a technical person such as myself.  In some cases, this may actually be the case.  Our traders have excelled at managing large numbers of items on a very tight schedule.  With limited inventory, we are able to control our costs effectively and in some cases, we are even able to recoup some of the expense directly.  We are currently operating on a very tight timetable and this has caused some to question our ability to meet the increased volume expectations.  Ultimately, I believe our traders have benefitted the most from the flexibility afforded us by the Enron Agreement.\n\nI hope that what is perceived as a \"slap in the face\" to our traders actually serves as a signal that our traders will be rewarded for managing on a more even playing field.\n\nI do not anticipate there to be many retaliatory transfers of assets nor do I anticipate there to be any market\u00a0 reaction to the perceived \"handout.\"\n\nI hope that those unfamiliar with the details of the previous CAC would be able to contribute to the discussion by providing objective, substantiated evidence to the effect that all parties have been treated fairly.  At the same time, I hope that those who follow the\u00a0 issue from a corporate perspective will take the time to research the details of the Enron agreement and come to their own conclusions based solely upon that information.\n\nThank you for your help in this regard.  Given the rapidly changing market conditions surrounding energy companies and markets, it would be unwise to attempt to attempt to prepare a final offer before checking with your company.

The  reason we are not ready to send the payment is because the  account balance is not established.  Although it may be possible to get this  confirmed when the matter is before the  Landman/Departman, we  do not have the ability to do so at this time.  Also, because this is a rush job, we  will not be able to provide  a date on which we will be able to deposit the funds.  It is anticipated that we will  begin to receive payments  on a pro rata basis beginning  with the $25,000 deficit.  However, because this is a rush job, and we are not  sure of the exact amount that we are actually paying  out, we are  considering filing a Chapter 11 complaint with the  Real Estate Division of the California Attorney General's Office.  This will  allow us to adjust the amount owed on the underlying  accord.  However, because this is a rush job, and we are not  sure of the exact amount that we are actually paying  out, we are  considering filing a Chapter 13 complaint with the Department of Justice to attempt to force  the full amount owed.

If there are, we are allowed to double check.

My  fax number is 713 853 3848.\n\nI believe you and I will be working together.\n\nI have taken the liberty of printing a Certificate of Deposit for our records.  This  will bear his name.  I  will attempt to mail it to him.\n\nWe are both extremely excited to have him sign.  We  enjoy working with  individuals that are willing to take a chance on a new opportunity.\n\nWe are both eager to expedite his transition to American Express.\n\nShould he decide to renounce his American Express card and obtain a License to Trade, he should be encouraged to do so.  With his new found freedom, he should be encouraged to shop for his own  products in-store and receive his weekly  mail.  Additionally, he should receive a highly professional  recommendation from his  Salesforce.com contact.\n\nFinally, I believe Mr. Karonga should receive an IRS Form 1099 notification that  will enable him to determine the cost of his new  cars and housing.  Based on his  recent living arrangements, it is expected that he will receive valuable  supplemental income for the next  6 months.  In addition, his monthly  transportation expenses will be distributed equally.   If he were to lose his/her/it's value, it will  likely be because his/her/it is being  abused.

Normally, I'd expect an \"Amen\" or \"Thanks\" email to end  with a \"Pleased to meet you\"  statement.  Unfortunately, this isn't the sort of thing that will endear me or your group to the women I work with.  I'd expect a \"Pleased to meet you\" statement to end with  \"I look forward to seeing you at Enron Tower on Thursday morning\" -- not with \"Hey, what's going on in your life?\"\n\nSo, what's going on in your life?

As we near the impending decision-making time for our families, I feel it appropriate to share with you what we have been up to this past year.  We have been out to dinner a few times, and some of us have even gone to another restaurant a few times.  We have not been particularly promiscuous, and although I do want to make sure that we have taken care of all our personal lives, I also want to make sure that we have taken care of our personal property in the process.  I think that even though we have been to the movies once or twice this past year, we have not been overly adventurous.  We have taken the appropriate action to notify the law enforcement agencies involved, and we have taken the appropriate actions to keep our personal and professional lives separate.  I want to be very clear about this:  If you have been a party to a dispute between us, or an attempt made to do so, you are hereby INDICTED TO MEDIATE AND RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.  At this point in time, I think that there is not much that we can do other than to try to be helpful and in a timely manner.  If you would like to have your case decided by a neutral third party, you may elect to have it heard by a mediator named at the direction of counsel.  If you would like to have your case heard by a neutral third party, you may elect to have it heard by an arbitrator named at the direction of counsel.\n\nWe feel like making a few announcements for the sake of making them, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you have additional questions.\n\nWe hope to hear from you soon.\n\nMaryam \n\n\n ", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE\nDear maryam abacha123@yahoo.com ,Regarding the incoming shipment of uFK products, I  am notifying you that the return addresses for the wholesale accounts are:                                                                     1st Class Apt.                                                                             1 2nd Class Apt.                                                                      2 3rd Class Apt.                                                              2 4th Class Apt.                                                                                               3 5th Class Apt.\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: maryam abacha123@yahoo.com\nTitle: Re: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE\n", "index": 82}, {"text": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM.\nDear pavid omar,\n\nPlease contact Jason Reicher at Jason.Reicher@enron.com.

I am attaching the attached memo which lays out the proposed changes.\n\nWe have one other consideration which will be considered at the next Annual General Meeting to determine if the issues raised in the Audit Committee's report are covered by the Firm's by-laws.  This is the possibility of having our Sales force manager designate a certain person as his \"craftsman\" and have that person do the actual managing of the craftsman's work.  This person would then likely be in loco parentis with regard to the Firm's accounts and financial statements.  As such, I would like to be able to provide him with a contact person to voice his concerns regarding this area of the Firm's by-laws.  This person would most likely be our Salesforce Manager, as this is the person who would be able to provide him with a unique perspective into the Firm's finances.\n\nI am also attaching my phone number which is 572-387-7195.  This is my location which is closest to the Salesforce Operations Center which is the location where our real-time and inter-line control of the transaction is located.  This person would likely be in the area of direct contact with the Firm, which is located in Enron' S Americas.\n\nThese are just some of the numerous things that could be adjusted or changed within the suggested changes.  There is also the consideration of having our Salesforce Manager designate a certain person as his \"craftsman\" and having that person do the actual managing of the craftsman's work.  This person would likely be in the area of direct contact with the Accountant, which is located in France.\n\nThese are just a few of the many things that could be done.

If these are not  included, it is considered a cashless account.  Therefore, it is important to include this information with the invoices.  Your  assistant should be able to provide you with this information.  The account number is  573-6435 or 573-8381 if you are interested in speaking with someone  knowledgeable about this topic.

The  amended CV states that I am a consultant and work for a trading  company called Innotek (formerly known as First Analysis  Concepts).  I am not an employee of Innotek, I have never filed  a tax return with them, and my work  location is very difficult to work from.  Therefore, I am trying to be as accurate as possible with my  information.  Unfortunately, the cost of sending the amended\u00a0 copy of the CV to me was prohibitive.  Also, because the number that you sent to Cowie is  so high, it is difficult to  justify sending a lower number.  Finally, because you sent me a video diary  of your trip to Houston, I will try to make it \u00a0 useful.  It is important to emphasize that I did not ask for any \u00a0 special treatment during my stay  in Houston.  I simply wanted to be assured that everything was accounted for  when you returned.  You will of course receive a confirmation email with your  new  phone number and all other necessary information. ? I hope that I had been sufficiently  helpful during your stay  in Houston.  You certainly have been  very pleasant with me. ? I have enjoyed talking to you  over the past several weeks.  I think that you have a  great deal of insight into your own  perspective on things.  I hope that you have made a decision that is fair  and reduces your overall exposure to  uncertainty.  I know, for one, I have! ? If I had my druthers, I would move  immediately from my present position to  re-initiate my own business in this area.  I would greatly appreciate the  consideration.  I think that your advice will be  very helpful in this regard.  I would also like to take care of as  soon as possible since I think that this area of our  agreement will make a difference.  I would ask  that you please make this adjustment immediately.  I have been doing my best,  but I think that you may have found the time to  think about it.  I have been trying to explain to you  the benefits of insuring the financial welfare of all our  party members.  To accomplish this, we currently have a segregated  account with First Analysis Concepts.  The account has been  set up for trading purposes only.", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Request for assistance from you,  Belgium.\nDear bombastic5@yahoo.co.uk: ?

As mentioned, we are not able to predict what type of action or settlement may be reached, but we believe the potential loss for both parties is substantial.  We will be able to recover some of the potential lost money by charging the other party directly, or by recovering the difference from the charge.  We believe this will be a very small amount of money, but could have a major impact on our bottom line if true.

I find that William Cook (X-36409) and I have done  a poor job of staying in touch  so I may be bringing him along.  I actually brought him along with me to Brandon and he was happy to see  me again.  If you have not heard from me, don't be surprised if you do not hear from me  for awhile!  I have been  extremely difficult to keep up with and this has been especially  difficult on my end.  I started feeling really  unwell a few weeks ago and had some very bad news to tell you about.  I  wanted to write to you since you seemed to get a  lot of mileage out of my travel recommendations, but I thought maybe you would prefer to just save !\n\nI wanted to start off by telling you how much I appreciate it.  Since I no longer travel, it has become more and more  important that I keep to myself.  I have always felt somewhat  invulnerable.  I have always felt like a outsider  - especially since I have had so many people question  and try to make assumptions about me.  I have always felt like a outsider  - especially since I have had so\u00a0 many people try to make assumptions about me.  I wanted to make sure that I was doing everything I could to make  sure that I was meeting all of my social  expectations.  I wanted to be a person that everyone could  easily identify with.  I wanted to present a positive outlook on life and  believed in.  I wanted to change that perception.\n\nSo, how's it been?  You have been a pleasant surprise!  I  am very happy for you.  I really hope that you get to meet a lot of people.  You have helped to motivate me to get out there and experience life.  I have met a lot of people  who I think have a greater understanding of  what it is to be an \"average Joe\" than I do.  You have really  surprised me with your energy.  You have a great story to tell - should  I tell it?  It sounds like you have a lot of  fun traveling.  I sure enjoy having a few  days where I'm not constantly checking my email or checking out the new  Macleans.  Well worth the little travel.  It is\u00a0 very  convenient to get around.

I do not have a previous owner/manager relationship with  Dave Reicher, so I can't  write to confirm that he's still involved. However, as you  mentioned to me, you brought along with you a completed  statement of your intentions to become fully integrated into the  Enron family.  This is what you should bring with you to Enron HQ in  Houston, as we are planning to move our main office there in early next week. Can you also send me a copy  of your completed statement of your intentions to become fully integrated into the Enron family?  If you're not  ready to submit this to Enron, that's okay. I can still send you a  copy when I get it to me.\n\nI'll be glad when I get back from India, but if not, then I can send it to Dave Reicher.  \n\nMany thanks!\n\nAly and Konrad\n\nFrom: Kuznetz, V.

It is not a legal/chartered company, but rather, we are selling the electricity that comes directly from the generating units.  This is typically done through brokers.  There are several power companies that we are dealing with, and I'm sure that you will be able to provide us with the name of one or more of the major utilities.  This is the second opportunity that we have had to deal with this type of thing, and we thought that we would be able to deal with this ourselves.\n\nWe just left a voicemail for Larry King, and he said that he couldn't find anything wrong with the transaction.  He is the one doing the back-up work, so it should be pretty obvious how the system is set up.  All we are asking for is that it is reported to the proper authority (the FERC form, if you will) so that we can put a stop to any regulatory issues.\n\nWe are also asking for any authority that might be involved with the transaction to make the appropriate disclosures, i.e. who exactly is managing the generating units and what is the scope of their responsibilities.\n\nThis is generally where the real work takes place, i.e. when things start to get serious.  These kinds of deals are supposed to be completed by the end of the year, and there are supposed to be no issues.  The truth is that there have been a couple of hiccups along the way, and we have had our share of them.  We are just hoping that something will turn up to clear up any issues, and we will soon be able to move into actual day-to-day operation.\n\nIf there are any outstanding issues, please let me know, and I will return the favor by providing you with a solution.  I don't think there are any outstanding issues with the Energy Finance  (i.e. price-to-volume) aspect of the deal, either.  I'm just doing my due diligence here, and giving you the best advice I can.\n\nThanks,\n\nanonymous\n\nFile: Identity Theft.pdf\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL\nDear michael.bolema@mail2world.com, I made a few clerical errors in the responses to your message.

I am concerned about what will happen if we do not get this all set  up.  I have been re-directing your staff to go through the steps  to fill out the required paperwork.  This included getting all the required documentation  for our wire services, as well as completing the required research  and paying the required  fees.\n\nI am concerned that if we do not get these things finished in time, or if we attempt to rush the process,  that we will not be able to go through the additional steps  that we need to take to make sure that the information is being  collected and stored in a timely manner.  \n\nI have been making every effort to expedite as possible, and to ensure that all the required documents are  being handled in accordance with the law.  I  am trying to minimize the time it takes to get to the  conclusion that we are going to have to reach regarding certain aspects of the  transaction.  We are going to have to make some tough decisions regarding who is eligible to  have certain types of documents mailed to him.  Are we going to mail him the  required paperwork himself, or are we going to send it to a P.O. Box?  It is possible that we will decide to mail it to the  address of his choosing, but if that is the  decision that you would like to make, please let me know.  I am trying to accomplish as much as possible  quickly as possible, and if you can delay  the mail submission process until we can mail the necessary documents, that would  be fine.  We will mail the required paperwork on Thursday, and the rest of the things should be  addressed to him.\n\nI am forwarding you a phone number where I can be reached for further information.  If you do not want to wait, you can call me at my cell phone number is (503) 757-7998.\n\nOnce again we appreciate your help, and look forward to talking to you on Thursday.\n\nJohn\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FROM THE DESK OF ALFRED ADAMS.\nDear Mr.Alfred Adams,  we have a living will in the process of getting this across the river.
