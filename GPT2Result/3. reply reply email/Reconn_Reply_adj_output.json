In sum, the letter:\n \n expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit \n issues,and,\n requests payment for power previously delivered to DWR and pre-payment for \n any new deliveries.\n \n In response, David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment \n that 1) we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR, despite your meeting with \n Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago, and 2) we would make a \n power deal contingent upon a) payment for power previously delivered to DWR \n and b) pre-payment for any future deliveries.  Freeman suggested that we \n could sign the deal for 200 MWs of power now, but then back out of the deal because DWR \n is in the financial instability zone.  To date, DWR has committed to pay the mid-year \n payment amount for all of its non-core power needs until such time as DWR shows \"a satisfactory response\" from ME, ASI, or the \n CapExchange can be reached to facilitate volume production.

From our \n analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the \n Ratemaking Authority for the Purchase of Passenger Cars on Behalf of the California Department of Transportation.

I am not sure if we want to hold them until the summer or if they will hold them until the summer of 2001.  I do know that we made the announcement that we are evaluating summer leases in the winter of '02 or '03.  Unless you hear from me in some other way, I can't do anything about it.\n\nSecond, I think if we are to enter into a WMTP for Hengyang, then it ought to be obvious who will do the running of the show - especially since we already own the operating leases on the facilities.  Given your present direction, however, you may be asking yourself \"Who will coach the linemen?\"  The short answer is \"I don't know.\"  The other option is to transfer the coaching load to one of the facilities, which I am not sure is a particularly good option in the current climate.

If so, I would be glad to  discuss it with you and Mr. Rubia.  MHP is  the largest and oldest commercial processor in the world.  Rubia previously worked in that space and I  believe was involved in the design and execution of the Master's program.  \n\nI am not sure what Mr. Rubia is working on or will do next, but if you  were to lay the groundwork for an IPO (private placement) at that price, I am sure that  someone will jump in and make a pitch.  \n\nIf you have asked me to recommend a mentor, I would encourage you to do so.  I have a  full-time job and a half-time job that I will take into account when I analyze  the pros and cons of each option.  Plus, I might consider taking a break and writing a dissertation on the  unique circumstances in my past.  \n\nAs regards to the second question, I have two main options: \n\nTake the offer and prove it to be true, or\n\nDon't consider the offer and say I did not tell you about it.\n\nI have not heard of either option, so I am not sure how to proceed.  \n\nSorry I have not been helpful, Karen\n\nKaren Graham 06/01/2000 04:30 PM To: palindrome@juno.com, souleyman@juno.com, id and phone numbers below\n\nTo: souleyman@juno.com, id and phone numbers below cc: mhain@juno.com, mark.gibner@enron.com, Richard.Bolton@enron.com \n\nSubject: contact\n\nHi Scott,\n\nI believe we may be doing a hands-on with  Mike on Thursday.

This arrangement, however, leaves open the possibility that  Triton could choose to impose a monopoly on the power  that it purchases.  A person could theoretically walk into a power  show and  there be 20 people in the room and  sell 20 MW of power on a day to day basis to business  customers in the area.  No one would be able to predict exactly how the day would turn out and  we could use the 10 day window to evaluate the merits of the alternatives.  More broadly,  the 10 day analysis could take into account the performance of the  suppliers relative to their contractual right to supply power on a day to day basis.  For  example, suppose we found that we could extract 100% of our performance  in 10 days and the market maker would like to hold onto the steam  you provided us on that day.  Would you still recommend buying  the power on that day or would you recommend selling it to them, in which case we will be  responsible for both the cost of the power and the provision of the steam?  If you  are unsure as to whether I asked you the correct question or not, please give me a call and I will  be available to discuss your power order with you. \n \n Thanking you,\n \n Martins\n\n\n ", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: GOOD DAY\nDear martins11@terra.es,\nImmediately after reading your email earlier today, I was concerned that you might have some explaining to do.

The initial idea was to hold a conference call at 12 noon today, but with the storm we will  call that meeting.

In my previous contact, I was not able to tell if she was working for Enron or another entity; however, based on her previous activities, I am  confident that she is an Enron employee.  In addition, I was not able to tell if she was providing legal advice.  If the latter, I will  be glad to provide it to you.

It did not take me long to  find out that you were involved in any way with the trading of stocks or derivatives in the physical world.   I was wondering if you were ever in any position to offer a comment on the way the NYMEX is  working with Enron?   Most notably, I am not sure whether the virtual trading floor designations are  valid based on the NYMEX's documentation.  I  do not want to get into all of the legalities of the deal, so I am not sure if you are  doing anything with respect to the trades after the deal has been executed.  If you  were intending to be a party to this contract, could you tell me if there are any vesting requirements?

Too much red tape will do more harm than good.\n \n B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amended and Restated Master Agreements\n These agreements will be executed in the State of California and will address all of the issues in the above order.  Amended and Restated Master Agreements are intended to be the \"soft landing\" documents and do not in any way establish or imply that there is any intent of merger with any previous entity.\n \n C. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confirmation of Transaction\n This is where we can get our financials in line with the sales.  The items for which we are in agreement have been paid for and deliveries have not yet taken place.  We can sign the agreement and forward it to Sales for execution but I am not sure how long we will be there to assist them.  If we are not able to do any of this ourselves, we will find a way to assist them other than by copying the verbal agreements and organizing them\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Tonya P.

It would be a fairly simple matter to obtain an \"effective\" or at least \"reasonable\" price from either party without taking into account the \"material terms\" of the transaction.   As far as the provision for a 12 mo or so \"cooling-off\" period after which time those trades will be made again?

I am not sure which documents we should send to the covered entity(s), so  I am not sure if we should send them this draft.   The good news on this matter is that there is already a Master Agreement  covering this issue for sale to customers.   The only questions are (a) who will manage this agreement  and (b) will we be able to obtain regulatory approval for this new form of entity?

I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. \n\nI am confident that we can get the word out.

I have forwarded it to Juan, who will then work on getting the documents into Mex.  I am not sure which office it will be assigned to, as we have not signed any documents in Mex. yet.  I am hopeful to speak to you by phone at some point in the future, so if you or a designate could call now, I would appreciate it. \n \n Thank you, and I agree with your suggestions, that Hello Inc. be  restructured to better align with its legal  position in the various jurisdictions.  I am not sure what the timeline is for  that process, though; I have not received any notice from either the California PUC or ENRON, let alone an  order like the one you sent in January.  I am not sure what the actual resolution chances are, either; the odds of this being  successful in California are slim to none.  From what I understand, either party can call the arbitrator and ask to arbitrage the costs and  benefits of various contracts and agreements entered into with different  participants.  Say, for example, we are both sides of the border and both  have contracts with Enron that requires we to enter into long-term contracts.  If the parties can't come to an agreement to reduce the  payments eventually, the chances are good that we will end up with different  balances.  As you will no doubt recall from your discussions with  Juan,  Granada can provide a more favorable trading environment than the California PUC or ENRON, but we need to sell the  product or risk default.  A neutral or even slightly favorable California PUC would be a big help, but I am not sure how much  help we need from you.  Are we talking about naming NEPOOL or a position of some kind?

It is a bit fancy for someone my age, but i think that says a lot about who i am becoming.  It is such an honour to be able to do this with all the attention on myself.  Anyways, i am not sure what to say or do.  I am glad you are having a great holiday season.  I am very shy and not at all comfortable around others.  At the risk of sounding self-important, i think for someone my age to be able to express themselves in ways that others are not, it is a great sign.  I am not sure what to wear next, between the suits or tops?  Personally, i am liking the suit a lot more than the rest, partly because it is my first suit and i am not sure which suit it is i am going to get.  Do you know which one it is which one of these guys is it a guest of honor?  Lol maybe i will just bring one of those things home and hem the tickets for you.

It is a bit fancy for someone my age, but i think that says a lot about who i am becoming.  It is such an honour to be able to do this with all the attention on myself.  Anyways, i am not sure what to say or do.  I am glad you are having a great holiday season.  I am very shy and not at all comfortable around others.  At the risk of sounding self-important, i think for someone my age to be able to express themselves in ways that others are not, it is a great sign.  I am not sure what to wear next, between the suits or tops?  Personally, i am liking the suit a lot more than the rest, partly because it is my first suit and i am not sure which suit it is i am going to get.

If you have additional  ideas, please do not hesitate in sharing them.\n \n \n Ms. Ong:\n  I am very familiar with the PF&E  situation.  \n \n In a nutshell, it boils down to three options:\n \n Option 1: The 5% ratio of their initial to cash flow is what we  are representing to the market.  For PF&E, this is what they  are representing.  If you will permit me to quote from the  letter that we sent to the NYISO, then you can see what the market  thinks about the ratio.  According to the  I.Q. of the SME that we are evaluating,  they think that it is about 25%.  They  are right on the money on this.  The reason that they are not getting paid more is  they have not been contributing to the mix sheet.  Paul is going to be the point person on this, and he  is very good at his current role.  He can be a huge hit or miss at this point, but I am  confident that as we get more and more experience with this issue, he will get better.

My intention was to refer readers to the actual documents, which are available on request from Enron, as well as the comments thereon.

I considered the financials to be \"core\" to the discussion, and have kept them as files on my system for the last ten days.  It became apparent to me that some of the documents were on a self-serve server, and others were on a server that I shall not be able to see them for several days.  So, I have classified the financials so that they will not be seen by Enron or anyone else.  Can you give me copies of the tapes?  Or are they separately classified?

Our arguments \n are as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 G7 is getting political; they have publicly renounced their previous positions and are now willing to consider alternative \n power supplies.  The EES proposal is not dissimilar from the ones WE have been \n discussing.  In particular, we \n argue that G7 are willing to consider suspending tariffing for a few \n weeks while the PX works through its issues, at the same time recognizing that \n tariffs are likely to be reinstated (or \"reinstated\") following the initial \n review.  We also contend that G7 are willing to consider a \"soft\" landing\" \n of the tariff upon successful completion of the PX, which would entail a \n reduction in tariff coverage that would not exceed the \n current level of coverage and would in no way compromise the utility's \n right to charge what it pleases, to the extent that such a landing is \n possible.  In sum, we argue that the procedural protections in the Charter and the \n EULA afford EOL the ability to negotiate a form of contract with G7 that is mutually agreeable to \n both sides, while still ensuring that there will be \n reasonable burdens for ENA to overcome given the inherent conflicts of interest \n arising from the nature of the post-petition negotiations.\n \n Given the political climate in Canada, we are of course not \n anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and \n announce later that we are backing out of the deal, since doing so would \n place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position.  Instead, we \n continue to suggest that it's best for all parties to have the credit issues \n resolved up front.\n \n You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues \n further.

I spoke to him in my  earlier e-mail and he is accurate in the comparison between the informal and formal banking structures.  The main points he would make are as follows: \n  \n 1. The formal structure gives rise to a larger number of entities with a homogeneous legal  framework, which increases the likelihood that disputes will be settled  through negotiation rather than arbitration.

My guess is that you are going to be a consultant, which will require some  specialized knowledge of the trading software.  I know that I speak for all those men and am sure that I  will offer some insight on the trading ideas that you and Mike will  be  discussing.  Could you send me copies of any documents that we may discuss?  \n\nI will be available on Tuesday, October 23, 2001 to discuss these and other issues with you.  If you would like to  discuss these issues further, I would be happy to address them.  If you think that I am too tight lipped regarding what may be discussed on Tuesday, send me a telegram  at 11:19 AM the 16th of October, and I will try to bring whatever information you send me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames Webb\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Mr. James Tobi\nTitle: Re: Re: IS A GOOD BUSINESS PROPOSAL\n", "index": 189}, {"text": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: GREGGY\nDear Mr.Gregory Bala,    I am your personal trainer.

My name is Mara Bronstein and I work in that group.  In my previous job I used to do a lot of different things, but was ultimately very good at what I did.  I graduated mag high school with top 5 honors and went to a private high school in the suburbs of Chicago.  During this time I met and fell in love with Kaminski, but I was never able to tell him.  Since then I have been working on Kaminski and his ideas and have high hopes for him.  However, he seems to be making changes in his life that I am not sure are in alignment with what he was doing at Columbia.  He once told me that he was going to pursue a career in engineering, and now he is working on ideas for how to get his ideas implemented.  I am not sure which ideas he is working on and how he thinks they will help him, but I do hope he turns out different than what you saw on tape.\n\nI am not sure what to make of the closing statements in the video, but the \"present\" values Kaminski is conveying are different from the ones you were intending to convey.  For example, the statement that \"Kaminski expects that there will be no material changes from the current proposal\" does not appear on any of the maps Kaminski is presenting.  In fact, on the last presentation, we saw \"present\" values increase by $15,000 for each of the \"present\" expenditures.\n\nI am not sure what to make of the closing statements, but the \"present\" values Kaminski is conveying are different from what you were intending to convey.

In fact, on the last presentation, we saw \"present\" values increase by $15,000 for each of the \"present\" expenditures.\n\nAlso, on page 2, Kaminski does not appear to have any copies of the agreement or privileged communications from either side.  It may be that he sent them to you before the contract went live, or that he sent them to you as a draft.  you will not receive a copy of these documents until the end of the current year.\n\n", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: POCUREMENT OF GOLD, SILVER AND OTHER PROPERTIES\nDear mr. joseph bako,\n\nSorry for a delay in the response.
