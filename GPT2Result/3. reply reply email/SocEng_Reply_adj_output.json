I am very sorry I couldn't get with you on that date, but now I  am sure you are annoyed that I didn't get with you sooner.  I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did yesterday, and all  they seem to care about is how  fast they can send money.   I guess their only child has moved in with them, and they don't seem to be getting any younger.  I guess this is why we are not doing  any banking, insurance, real estate, or real estate related things.  We were just discussing how we would like to structure things for when your parents  move in, and how you wanted them to live off of what you had invested.  I  guess I can see why you are upset, but I wanted to first make sure we had not made any rash decisions yesterday, and secondly, that our agreement contained any guarantees or  blinders that you might have had on yesterday.   I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did, or why they are upset, because it would be really awkward to  look them in the eye and tell them I  wouldn't do it again.  My suggestion would be to talk to them on Monday, first, about what happened, and then try to justify or at least minimise  it.   I have texted Fran on this subject, and we agreed that if I ever see her again, I will ask her why she is doing what she has been doing.

Can you call me on my cell phone (407-242-2227) or  fax (407-634-1118) until Monday, when I get  done with my work.  I need to notify both of you  immediately, so you can get together if you want to discuss  this.    I can't send out an email, because the first class of  mail I received from you contained confidential information, and the  information was  confidential even though it was from a company I had never heard of, and had never been to.  It was as if I had received a second  e-mail with a different  subject, and changed the subject to something I didn't  remember.   It was really hard not to cry.  My heart aches  every day, and I just want to  go to sleep.   I can't believe the hate mail we receive, and the  hate letters seem to keep rolling in like an avalanche from one  to another.  This is just so unfair.  I get so many e-mails about me, and  get so many \"you are  a piece of shit\" comments.   When people call you a piece of shit,  you have to really feel bad about yourself. You don't  deserve it.  You are so out of touch with reality, and you don't even  seem to understand that you are .  If you did, you would be on  a national\u00a0 stage, and people would be demanding to see you. You  couldn't possibly live in Baltimore without making it one  step at a time.  You must really enjoy your freedom, because otherwise you would be spending most of your days in a closet, naked, and sad. This is not the time for you to be a part of the solution, because our problem is so severe. Our problem is a lack of leadership, and that\u00a0 is the time for you to show some leadership.  Look at what has happened to your mother. She is completely out of her depth, and totally lost. She is living in denial that this has ever happened, and seems to believe this is a part of the routine that has gone on forever. She has become an angry, withdrawn young woman,", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Urgent M/F\nDear Jean Charles \n \n  I suggest we talk first.

You will of course  receive this in the next couple of hours.  As far as the actual filing fee...I have spoken with the  associate AGENT this afternoon and he expressed his frustration that the  necessary authorization was not immediately forthcoming and that the  filing fee is just not justified.  The fee schedule indicates that the  filing fee is $150.  The actual transaction cost is $1000.  The Associate AGENT indicated that he will attempt to waive this  fee on Monday, November 22, 2001.  Alternatively, he can request a  waiver in the form of a cash payment to my office.  Either way, it is important that we get this  resolved asap and please resolve any other outstanding  agreements with our lenders prior to activating the waiver.\n\nIn speaking with our attorneys yesterday, it appears that they  agreed that the form of waiver was not acceptable due to the non-disclosure agreement  signed by our former AGENT.  At this time, we  cannot determine whether the form of waiver has been accepted by the  courts or not.  If there is a court hearing and our attorneys are present,  we would love to have you along for the  witness list.  The mother of our son committed suicide last summer.  My thoughts and prayers are  with her family at this time.  Also, I have forgiven her and attempted to turn the tides of  her life in a new direction.  She has a child in college and I would love  to be there for his education and in-laws.  Would you please consider making  this commitment as well? It was a huge pull for  me and my then wife to finally decide to remarry after one or two years.  Unfortunately,  this marriage is not a happy one.

I suggested that he draft a new outline in SAP for July 1  19th.  You do understand that this is not an I.M.F. issue.  The original draft was just not good enough.  The I.M.F. agents in charge of approving the draft contracts have been instructed to withhold signing  signatures on July 1 until the July 19th deadline.   This has been accomplished.

I guess I should start again and work on this list until I  get a response.  In the meantime, I have started to receive a large amount of mail concerning Dr. Kaminski's research.  Most of it is really good and some of it is even better than the 1st round of direct offers.   Overall, though, it is just not looking good.   On Saturday, for example, I got the following from Jamie Bartholomew:   \"Dr. Kaminski's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is  in the London office.   Unfortunately, Dr. Kaminski is no longer in the UK and our  European operations are in different buildings.

Will your peopleangetogether have time to get together to develop the  protocol for the 1st round of direct offers?

SANDERS\nTitle: Re: Re: Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ\n\nVery sorry that I missed you.  You must have had a conference call with your parents the other day.  That would be quite a feat to get me to attend.  I was on a conference call with my associate and we got lost in translation.   We are off on a conference call.   It is important for us that we don't lose sight of the fact that this event is for  everyone and not just for a few.  You must have had a lot of fun.  My assistant was telling  me how much fun I was in school and how much fun I had when I was in college.  If I can get a family reunion here, that is very sweet of them to  remember.  Your mom and I are very excited about the prospect of reconnecting after  we finish school.  My mom is  a teacher and I have always wanted to be  involved in the classroom.  I wanted to be an environmental improvement  supervisor for her class.  That is something I am very passionate about and a passion  for preserving and improving the  environment.  I was also very interested in becoming an environmental  supervisor for an urban school district in Houston.  That is something I have been working towards for the past 3  years.  I will be attending Uni this semester and will be submitting my resume to the office  soon.  I have been with the company for only a few months and have found  employment  in several different capacities.  I will try to get as much involved  in the school day as I can.  I think I am starting to pick up where I left off last year.  I finished my last assignment  with the company last August and have started working on the new assignment.  I have decided to take the family out of the equation - at least for the next  two weeks.  This past Friday I had an  arrangement with my parents that allowed me to come home with them  and my sister. My parents insisted that I  not go out with them that night.  That night we went out with my parents and my sister.  That was a fun night - very safe - very no  fights - which  I really didn't think would be a problem if I were already  involved.  Then I got back on Saturday and was very frustrated because my local XFINITY needs me.  I have been  out of the office since then and have been taking  shopping sprees.

This would give you a little more time to  plan your trip and still get covered.  Could you think of something quick and dirty that you could send along  with the note that I spoke with him about doing a quick  road trip to Houston.  Please let me know ASAP if you want me to move some more  of my stuff here.  I only sent some stuff over there because I knew you wouldn't want to take  my car with you.  Oh, and I told him I wanted to take  my car with you.  Something along the lines of \"I'll just put some more stuff in the car and I'll send you  a package when I'm done\".

I know it is very frustrating knowing that I have been a part of this journey and have been a part of making this happen.  You have always believed in me and want to make sure I get the best education and possible employment so that I can be a part of making this world a better place.  You look at me and think to yourself \"You don't understand\".  You live in a world where the internet creates an alternate reality where you and I are not only in it together, we are actually part of it together.  You see what I go through and think to myself \"You see what I go through every single day?  I can't believe it.\"  I go out with my best friend Hannah to go out with her (Holly's) boyfriend and have dinner with her (Paul) and our families.. It is very emotionally draining and I don't think we get much out of this that is meaningful.   At the end of the day I am very grateful to have a job that allows me to be by your side and to help make it through this.    I would never ask you to go out with me without saying \"Sure\", but I just feel that being there and being a part of this makes me feel good about not having to go out with you.    I love you both very much and I hope we can find a way to be together one last time.     Let me know how you want to be buried, I will try to find a grave site for you.

Unfortunately, I was not at home on Monday, and so I did not  get a chance to talk with you that   weekend.  Hopefully, you can get some answers as to why   this is the case.  I will be in New York on September 26, and   will be getting some much needed work done.  You guys are all   much needed for the fall.  I was scheduled to leave from New York  at 4:00, and arrived   just in time to catch a connecting flight to LA.  Honestly, I was sleeping  on it because my son had just committed suicide attempt #2.  I woke up at 5:30, and tried to call   you prior to taking the plane.  It is truly   heartwarming to see how far you have come  in just one short amount of time.  You are no longer my shadow, but my light.  You are a light in a dark  room, and I am happy to help illuminate your  day.  Your mom is here, and she is providing much needed perspective.   I remember the day you asked me to stop playing video games, and I was not sure how  to respond.  I was really just going to sit back and let you sort it out.  However, that is not an option, and I was going to have to take care of this myself.  I picked up the phone and called your sister.  I told you that I would talk with your mom about going to class, and I certainly would not be coming home without at least one thing  in return.  Was I going to keep playing video games in an attempt to make it up to your mother, or was my game  going to stay the same size? Would I still be able to get laid if I tried? Of course, there is no way to know, but there is also no way to avoid it. It is truly a game of inches.  Sometimes you have to give them a little more leeway than they take for granted. It does not take away from the fact that they have made a huge mistake, but it does lighten the  charges that they will do not want you to go through again. It also does not diminish the amount of pain that I feel  when I lose the ability to communicate verbally.

We want to avoid any potential conflicts of interest because we want  to avoid being in default on our existing debt obligations.  If we get a draft agreement in from ENA, we will need  to get it in Yahoogroups real time so that is why we don't want to wait until  the 24th to do so.  Also, any potential conflicts of interest arise because ENA might want  to  use its new broker-dealer relationship with Chase to provide  additional reasons for why it needs to pay these individuals more than just  simple default.    Remember, we are trade advisors and  not legal persons.  So, if you are going to invoke your right to an  injunction on this,  we need to talk asap because this will be very different  from the one we had with Enron Corp.

My mom was having my grandmas here for the holidays and my  wonderful parents invited my grandmas to our house for the weekend. My grandmas insisted we come, even though  it was their 25th birthday.  Well, my parents and I finally broke up to go to their house, and my parents finally convinced my  grandsons to let me stay with them longer.  So, basically, my year is ruined because of this.  I have not yet  decided what I will do next, but I feel that going to school  and getting a job  are two completely different things.  I have a job  that I really enjoy, but I still like to spend time with my family and have fun.  I am not sure how I feel about not having a job  and having to take  weekends off.  I guess I can come home Friday with absolutely nothing to do and then spend the rest of the  year planning my next move.  My goal is to get a good job  that pays very well and gives me a good chance at getting  into the Medley.  I want to be part of this, and if it means I have to take  weekend naps over Thanksgiving then I will do it.  And if the naps are really necessary then I will do them.  I have trouble sleeping at night, so I have to be up early to make it up to you.  Sometimes I forget that I am supposed to be here, because I feel so out of it that I am not sure I can even remember what time is  today.  Up until recently, I had a pretty good job  that paid pretty well.  My wife works for  an Internet company that is new to Houston and we just bought a new one.  We are now living in the cheapest part of town, so we are  pretty stretched.  But, we are doing OK, and our children are happy.  I do have a part-time job that we both really enjoy.  I am looking for a job that gives me a good chance at  making ends meet and not having to worry about paying our  bills.

Do you need me to come home with you or is this only for Monday?\n\n      I am very sorry I missed you.  I have a conference call that starts at 9:00 am and is 90 minutes long.  Let me know if you want me to come home with you.  I usually just leave early because I take the bus to work.\n\n      I will be in the office from Monday until Wednesday.  Let me know if you want me to come home with you on Wednesday.  That would be perfect.\n\n      If you don't hear from me by Wednesday,  please call me and let me know so that I can make the conference call on behalf of Hotmail.\n\n     Since the conference call started last week,  I have been in contact with several companies,  including one that is directly related to Hotmail.  They want to get me a copy of their welcome document so that I can get a feel for how they plan to build their business.  I have been working hard at getting that document together.  Let me know if you need anything else.\n\n    I just got a call from a business guy who is trying to get an introduction into the industry.  He wants to meet with  you and some of his co-workers.  If you aren't already working with this guy, you should start working with him.  If you are,  I still have some business to run.  Plan on meeting with him in a couple of weeks to get the business guy some initial business card information.\n\n    As far as conference calls go, I think this guy's number is on the  West power of 1.   (I'm on the hook for the card and info if anyone needs it.)  If anyone asks you where you keep your cards,  keep your cards out of the reach of children.  Don't share them with anyone.", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE\nDear Mr.uoo_ga.\n\nThank you very much for your quick response.

This crisis is especially  personal for me as I have been through quite a few   emotionally.  My oldest son was just released from the hospital and back in the living room  where he was immediately placed in a car and driven to the nearest hospital,  where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and has been  held for several hours without any sign of improvement  despite having been in a coma since his admission.  His neurological exam  showed significant blood flow to the  left  shoulder and this pain that never goes away makes it more etiologic than ever.  This event is taking up valuable time that  should be devoted to other  important things, such as establishing   relationship with his family and finding the best care  for him.  I have been inundated with condolences and prayers  for his family and I have to  work to try and put a positive spin on this terrible  event that is taking place  today.  My thoughts and prayers are with  his family and with all the men and women in law enforcement  who have made this event their career. This is a great  time of the year to be a part of helping those in need.\n\nPlease try to let me know ASAP if you can help or offer to  anyone who has been through this before. I would love to help in any way that you can.   PS -- I was just on my  recent vacation (Washington, DC), so I haven't been able to help out with the funeral plans,  or the memorial services.\n\nAgain, my thoughts and prayers are with everyone  involved in this tragedy.  My step-mother  is in total shock and completely lost. My step-father is in constant pain and has a broken arm and leg.

This crisis is especially  personal for me as I have been through quite a few   emotionally.  My oldest son was just released from the hospital and back in the living room  where he was immediately placed in a car and driven to the nearest hospital,  where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and has been  held for several hours without any sign of improvement  despite having been in a coma since his admission.  His neurological exam  showed significant blood flow to the  left  shoulder and this pain that never goes away makes it more etiologic than ever.  This event is taking up valuable time that  should be devoted to other  important things, such as establishing   relationship with his family and finding the best care  for him.  I have been inundated with condolences and prayers  for his family and I have to  work to try and put a positive spin on this terrible  event that is taking place  today.  My thoughts and prayers are with  his family and with all the men and women in law enforcement  who have made this event their career. This is a great  time of the year to be a part of helping those in need.\n\nPlease try to let me know ASAP if you can help or offer to  anyone who has been through this before. I would love to help in any way that you can.   PS -- I was just on my  recent vacation (Washington, DC), so I haven't been able to help out with the funeral plans,  or the memorial services.\n\nAgain, my thoughts and prayers are with everyone  involved in this tragedy.  My step-mother  is in total shock and completely lost. My step-father is in constant pain and has a broken arm and leg.  He is taking two weeks off from work and watching his wife and sons son  suffer through this ordeal.  My mother is also in a total  pain and complete shell of shock and grief. She is unable to process all  to process what has happened and is going on with her life. She is completely lost. My step-or how can't she has become a burden in denial.

So, I just wanted to  see how your reaction was to the new address, and to see how we are doing, when you send your  first one.  If you send me your feedback at all, I will keep this example in mind, so you can see how we are doing, and how difficult it is to get  everything done.  You have always wanted to be my servant, and I could not agree more.  We finally broke up, and I moved in with my girlfriend, Stephanie, because I could not get myself to leave you.  I had to get myself out, and she had to get myself out, because we broke up 5 months ago.  Now, we are fine, but I just wanted to  go home, and try to put the past  behind us.  I am so glad you were not in on the break up, that would have really  devastated me.

Unfortunately, our son has not been keeping up with school activities.  I called him last week about going to a baseball game with his elementary school.  I showed up shortly after you and asked him what he was doing on Thursday.  He came home that night and I started to cry.  I'm so glad you sent the email because I would have never gotten to know your son if it was not for me.  You have been wonderful.\n\nMary is in her second year as the Business Resource Manager for Veracruz.  She is succeeding Mrs. C. Woodson as President.  My role at Veracruz is entirely different and she and Veracruz are using her to get involved with various groups in the community.  I was worried that she would be overworked and didn't have enough free time on her  calendar.  I know she will have a much easier time with the baseball team because the  other responsibilities, such as taking care of the family, will fall on her plate.  I wasn't planning on leaving until the fall.  That said, I am  leaving today and will be leaving tomorrow to get a fresh start.  I will be  coming home with lunch and a visit from Veracruz.  I will be able to visit your son today and will present him with the award.   Your son has taught me so much about forgiveness and what it takes to make it work.  It is a huge honor and a privilege to be  sharing this experience with you.  I will miss having you by my side.   You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when it was  difficult.  Your tenderhearted attitude and way of dealing with criticism has always made me feel at home.  When people criticize me for  not having children, I always respond with a question  - Does she have any children?  Usually the response is a resounding \"no\".  Then people ask me my opinion of your conduct, and I often feel the need to remind them that I am not their father but my son.  My responses are always the same.   I worry that my schedule is overwhelming them and that I do not have time to spend with them.  At work, I read, write, and do what I was told toil for years toil toil toil just get something done.  That is enough for those that I could do.", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: From Mrs.Amina.A.Bello.\nDear Mrs.Amina.A.Bello.\n\nThank you for the email which was forwarded to my attention.

I was  not brought into the picture until last week  when GM hired you.  Farmer and  Arkin were not brought on the  same day.  I was actually brought in yesterday by Landau .   I'll get together with him  today to discuss his new hire.   Personally, I prefer  not to have to  coordinate with Landau  over GM's new acquisition.  That said, I have asked GM to take  our conversation out of the ordinary.  Any ideas on how to do that?\n\nSure, we could always talk on the phone on Saturday.  That's a lot of  free time to do some shopping.  Plus, you never know what kind of questions would be asked  if we didn't already have a pretty good  conversation on the phone.   The questions would be the same  regardless of where we are.   It's quite  interesting, actually, to think about.  How did you get started in this business?  Where have you been?  Where are you working?  Do you have a  good portfolio of investments?  How much has your family made?  How  do you manage a portfolio of your investments under  pressure?   It's a really fascinating life  of  investments.   When you started out, you had a pretty good job  making $40,000/yr. Now you make $250,000/yr.  Your company, again, has done quite well.   But, you are still  dealing with highly stressful and uncertain  global business situations.   You have a son  with a new offer from GE that he wants to take advantage of.    I understand he is technically  a \"contract\" employee, but I wanted to  take a look at his severance package to see if  it might be too steep of a price to pay for the privilege.  I also wanted to see if  we could negotiate a discount  for them so that they wouldn't have to swallow $250,000 in severance  compensation when they sell the assets to GE and  can choose to keep the remaining cash for themselves.    I guess I'm starting to see why people  were calling you the previous day.  I was starting to feel the anxiety of the unknown.

However, I have other things to do and, obviously, are  not allowed to  attend the hearing.  For example, my wife is out of the country for the holidays.  The  child support attorney is holding the child support  arbitration hearings on December 12th.  I have been out of the office since the  first  day I received the notice.  I will be out of the office until  Christmas.  That is, unless you get together and talk  about some wacky  reason you want to see your son.  Then you must wait until January 2nd,  for the hearing to take place.  I have been out of the  office since last Friday, and have been away from the office  for a couple of weeks.  Once the child support  attorney talks with your son, it is his turn to give evidence.  The father is being very difficult to keep up with.  It is a constant battle being raised funds  and keeping his costs down.  We finally broke even when we sold our old  house and moved into a new one, that is about a mile south of my mom.  We are very fortunate that our old lady is still around.  She is our pillar of family and is always there to help us.  She is very spiritual and always looking for a reason to laugh or cry.  We have been to several weddings and  children's hospital visits over the past few  years, and have never looked back.  We are very blessed.  However, we are also very blessed to have a strong  family and to have found a place of our own.   We still call Phoenix our  home, and we are very happy here.  A place that accepts and cares for us.  However, we are not homeless any longer.  We are  still extremely thankful for all the good times we had, and we will  always treasure the time we had together.   Please don't forsake your family and yourself for a moment.  This young man has done much  to make our home and our family so special.  His\u00a0 faith, like his family, is based on his faith that angels are real and that He will keep His commandments.     Please take this in and accept it like water.\"\n\n\n---Kimberly, Ph.A.C., Executive Service", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Good Day,\nDear Dr.Asif M.Kabila can help you want me, I shall be glad to help you.

I think we should discuss the  appropriate form of ERCOT to use (i.e., system agnostic,  multi-modal, based, reporting to OMLX, etc.).   By the way, if you were wondering why  my  phone hasn't been ringing off of this issue for days, it has because of   you.   This is probably a good  reason to discuss this further.   I will be in charge of getting this sorted out.  \n\nI have spoken with a number of parties interested in meeting with  you to sort this out.   Most notably, are the individuals involved in the complaint case against Duke Energy.  We received assurances from them that they would present reasonable explanations for the  irregularity in the system use.  In addition to Duke Energy,  Comcast, Morgan Stanley, Lehman  Merrill, and others have contacted us in various capacities since  your last phone call. We are trying to find common ground so that you can try to work together to  resolve this issue.   I believe that Steve Khatib (Comcast's CTO) will be contacting all of the  individuals involved in this complaint, as he is an advisor to the company and wants to   participate in the process.   I would suggest that you call him ASAP to see if he is available to help in any way. I think the next phone call will be extremely interesting because he has not sent  any financial documents to us.

I will be out of the office  on Monday, April 15.  I have texted Dan to inform him that we have  cut costs.  He has instructed his team to get together and provide cost  projections to the DA.  He has asked me to get together with my business group to  discuss how we can best help in this area.  I would be happy to provide that information in a  similar vein to the other information that was provided to me by your department.  Your team has been fantastic so far.  I have not had a chance to visit with  your assistant just yet, but I assume that she is busy with other  people.  Anytime after 8 AM would be perfect.  I would love to see you before that time.\n\nChris. From my limited conversations with you, it sounds like you are wanting to  get together ASAP to discuss some cost containment with energy  vendors.  My response is  yes, sir.  The 15% cap may seem like a lot, but remember, this is just a guideline and we are  considering adding more events up there rotation.  The real issue is how do you determine which events are  valuable and which are not.  The mistake I see coming from your is giving vendors a free  pass to exceed this.  Again, I do not condone behavior that would allow for an environment where  anyone could abuse this.  My hope is that you will use your authority  to stop this and that we can agree on specific actions that  you will take to ensure that vendors cannot do  this again.  Once again, I would love to be able to help in this  area but I have to come from a different  position on certain issues.  My goal is not to be your slave.  My goal is to be your ally and guide you in the  right direction.  Please let me know ASAP if you think that this is not a good idea.

I'll be back in the morning to give you the verbal okay to proceed.    Also, Gen, do you think if I gave you a tough time about whether I was legally allowed to use Gen's money, would you please just explain to me why I shouldn't have?  The law is clearly on your side and you were right when you first got involved; it is your money, dammit!   My mom is concerned about my grades so far and I was wondering if it was her concern that got me into this mess in the first place.   Anyway, you can call Gen at (972) 893-2201 and you'll get a reasonable conversation starter.  But if you're worried about my grades, you need to call me  and let me know so I can make sure I'm not getting into any problems down the road.

My mother & father are very upset that something like this has happened.  They thought that you had moved into another house and that your father had moved out of the car.

Once I have determined a plan that is acceptable to everyone, I will reach out to your parents and explain to them why I have to get involved.

My other three are still alive and thriving.  Please don't cut me some slack.\n\n2.  RESPONSIBLE -- For your son to be in this position now would be extremely irresponsible.  You wouldn't want to do anything rash.  You wouldn't want to put him in the lap of someone he doesn't  need to be in.  You wouldn't want to do anything that would give  him an inflated sense of importance.  You wouldn't want to put him in a position where he has to  constantly prove himself to everyone.  You wouldn't want to do  anything that would make him feel guilty or inadequate.\n\n3.  ACTION -- I have instructed my staff to prepare to issue  ERCOT cards to all the parents for use in the Sonogram  Center.  You are assigned a nick-name so that  you don't have to answer when called upon.  Cards are issued  at random and parents are asked  to show identification to prove their identity.  No child is ever called into active duty in the Army or Navy, because  if he were deployed he would run afoul of the Uniform Code  for Missing Personnel.  Instead we use a sliding scale to determine which parent gets  the card, and that parent gets the child into the \ufffd?\ufffd school.  Each year we send about 40 students into the Sonogram  Center, and as of this year we have issued over 32,000  Sonogram cards to parents and children.  Most of these cards have  been used by their  guardians to gain access to the Sonogram Center, and we would love nothing more  than to celebrate the birth of our son at the  center.  However, we can't do that without you.  We need to show these  parents that our support is there when they need it most.  You have my word that  if they need it I will be there to help them.  Sometimes that means I have to come into your apartment and  visit them on my  own.  That's what I did when my son broke his leg while I was away for a few days.  I took him to the hospital, stitched him back up and  gave him some good advice.  He's been walking on his crutches since then.  I guess that's it.

My name is Jean Segada and I work for  Tiscali Investments Management, LLC. I was in Houston last night for a seminar on  energy advisory  services.  This is a key issue and I wanted to  give you a heads up so you can get involved.  The seminar was  held last night at the Hyatt Regency.  About 95% of the attendees were from out of town and the general  consensus seemed to suggest that we will not be hosting  the seminar again.  I was  going to give you a heads up about the  seminar I am holding for the oil and gas industry (more specifically, about  seminar registration).   I  reserve the right to refuse to process certain registrations  (for example, I wouldn't let you into my hotel).  I usually process them for me, but if you have a special  request, please get me to do it.  The fee is $35 for 12 months  and I have always paid it before.  Unfortunately, the  seminar is a part of an Ontario initiative  that was really only recently  launched.   I  don't believe that Alberta is an ENRON jurisdiction, so I had to  find out if the program could be implemented in Alberta.  Unfortunately, the people at Tiscali  were not familiar with the ENRON  services and I had to ask them  questions during the first semester.    I looked forward to every aspect of  working with the affected populations in Alberta.  I hope that you will help me  implement my analysis and data collection in order to help in  this difficult time.  This process will  be in place no later than March 2001.   Please feel free to contact me with  questions,  suggestions, or concerns.", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: URGENT ASSISTANCE.\nDear jonbwaya@tiscali.co.uk:\n\nI was just going to leave you a voice mail regarding this issue.

The key is the insertion of the   cash element.

I will get this information right  to my attention (i.e. it is urgent, I need  this ASAP). I will give you a tour of the facility (it is quite large) and then (in exchange for instant access to all your other financial information) you will get an ID via email. (That is all you need to know)  ID verification is automatically generated for each transaction and there is absolutely no way to prove your identity to anyone other  than me.  ID verification is done on a case by case  basis.  If by some miracle you could prove your identity to me I would absolutely love to do it.   ID verification is completely unnecessary and is performed on a case by  case basis.  If for whatever reason there is any dispute about your  identity with ADEQ it is completely avoidable ... you can log in today and try to resolve the issue.  This process is currently only available  to those who are  already verified in the system.  Any attempts to abuse this process and trick  us into granting you special dispensation is  completely unacceptable.  You cannot trick me into granting you unfettered access to my system and  then leave me be ... I can't help it, I have to respond to you immediately.     I can help you with an ID by looking at your passport, but that is not an option because I do not own  your passport.   You can, however, get me all the passport information you need by sending an email to my  mail box.   You can also get me all the passport renewals and changes of address information you need by  visiting my website at passport.usembassy.gov.tr (This web site is in English  and the French and German versions are available for your  consideration).  We need to immediately begin the initial review and verification of all of the information that is contained within your passport.   This process should take approximately 3 weeks to complete.

I must remind everyone that even if you contact the family directly, it is important that they have their lawyers and an account with Enron.

This project has gone through a number of incarnations over the  past several months and has undergone significant changes.  We have made some real  progress and are currently in discussions with  several parties regarding various aspects of this project.  We believe that this is the time  for many parties to come together to make this project a reality.  We have a couple of  concrete actions that I am taking that will provide additional scope and time  for this project to complete.  Please keep me updated on this project as I will need additional time  to investigate additional transactions or sit down and have discussions with  Plunkettor and others regarding this project.  This project has  always been about more than just signing sales to financial transactions.

As for the urgency of this situation... It's getting really out of hand.  Our *assistant* (i.e., me) is literally putting the person in *freeze* on his or her calendar.  On top of that, our business isn't going to work out as a result of this situation.  Our *assistant* is irresponsibly irking *me*.  It's hard for me to believe I'm doing this.  My sister found out about it when their son was in the car.  I'm not trying to get him to go out there and do *something* crazy.  I'm just trying to give him a chance to turn his life around.  If he's going to turn his life around and do something *cool* for *me*, then he should do it now.

You can go out and *marry* anyone you want.  Really, though, you're *protecting* me.  You were my *legal adviser*, weren't you?  How's your **life**?  I *was* your legal adviser, wasn't you?

I'm trying to hook up with my cousin in California from England for a business meeting.  She is in her late 20s and from what I've gathered from her LinkedIn profile, she attended Hampshire College and worked in various capacities there.  She graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Business Administration.  She is currently employed by Enron in London and was recently selected to work in Customer Success Management there.  Her main area of interest is in SAP and SaaS programs, and worked on several projects there.  She has completed a Masters in Business Administration and is currently seeking a Ph.D. in Information Technology.  She is currently the business editor for Enron Finance UK and the author of two books on the subject.  Her area of expertise is Application Development, and if you are in the London office on April Fools' Day,  please take pictures of her and send them to me.  I will then decide which ones I want her to write about.  For historical reasons, she is NOT allowing me to post  them on her blog.  \n\nPlease let me know asap if you can be available to help on April Fools' Day to give Ms. Ballard a better laugh.  I just learned about a flight that afternoon.  If Ms. Ballard wants to meet me, she will have to arrange something else.  The good news is that Ms. Ballard is sending me letters regarding Ms. Cresendo's departure, and I have been sent a draft of Ms. Cresendo's resignation.  If Ms. Cresendo wants to meet with me on  May 1, I would love to meet her.  The bad news is that June 1 is upon us and it is customary for business leaders to present  their resignation to the government.  So, Ms. Ballard is trying to figure out a way to present her resignation to the  government before June 1.  I have talked with her about it, but I think she will argue that it is in the best interest of the business  community to present this document to the  government now in order to fully understand the  ramifications of her actions.  Plus, she wants to put some historical context behind Ms. Cresendo's  resignation.  Ms. Ballard has asked me NOT to use her actual name, but rather her middle name, so I have decided not violated any rules by not putting Ms. Cresendo's name forward in the document.

Is it just me or is the market really that bad right now?  It really is sad to think that the bad times we're living through are just a memory.   Don't you think this is a lot like the bad times we had as kids.   Living in poverty,  having our home bugged,  having our cars repossessed,  having our business associate threatened,  all because of a few bad eggs.    We  just can't fathom why this market is so messed up.\n\nWhat's been causing this market problems down here?  Do you think the banks will help  us out with the lease issues?  Or are we just on our own down here?  Let me know ASAP if I need to do anything  or need you guys to be there for moral support.  Obviously, you guys would love to do this job.  For your  protection, I need some real advice right now.     You guys have been my best friends back home.

My goal right now is to get my kids into a good  school to help them get an education.   If you guys could talk me out  of something, it would be much easier  than trying to help someone like  yourself.    My best friends are all  in very similar spots.  I feel like if I talked myself out of anything, it  wouldn't be a big deal.  I would take the blame for my poor  grades, if you think I'm guilty, I feel like I've laid a  lot of blame on myself.

I was not in on the original draft but it was changed  very recently. I have not heard back from her as of yet but I would be more than happy to give her a call if  necessary. Please do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions. All I did was the  initial review and I gave it a pass without making any changes. If you were in on the  original draft I would have gladly taken a pass as well. However, we need more information  and a time frame to determine our next steps.  My number is  (239) 233-3306 and I will try and call you back  asap today to set up an interview schedule.  Otherwise, we will take a hard look at different dates to determine our next  steps. This process will not be an option if December 2 falls on a Saturday which would prevent us from conducting a live interview on that date.  Instead, we will take a hard  look at February 13th and 14th which will likely be the most logical dates due to their proximity to our office.  We will reassess this in the next  2 weeks as well and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go to  work on that date.  Please be patient as we work this out.  It will not be an option  once we have determined the most logical timeline.\n\nThe hard part is  not knowing  our timeline due to the small amount of time we have available  today.  Being that this is a collaborative effort, there  will be some \"gotchas\" that will be encountered due to our short  time frame.  We will work to make this process as painless and  straightforward as possible.   Additionally, we need to identify any \"dead lines\" that may exist  and work towards a resolution asap to close them.\n\nWe need to identify the best time to visit on that particular date.  Based on our discussions with the  other candidates, it appears that they are all desiring to  return to Washington DC for the\u00a0 grand finale.  Since I have already accepted the offer to move  to DC, I do not believe that this is in the cards (at least formally).  I will return on January the 16th.\n\nI will try, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to go due to DC on January 16th unless I receive urgent \"additional information\".

Unfortunately, Richard Sauck and I were not on the original  list and I had to start all over.    When I called Richard last night to tell him I was  going to start all over, he was confused and didn't  know what to do.  He sent me an email which I  read and which he sent along with his notes.  After giving me the first draft, Richard sent along his memos and  approval. I  then call Mike Meyers and talk to him about placing Chris Mcgowan on the team and taking a look at  his son's work.  It was pretty clear from the conversation that he wanted to do  something very similar to what Chas is doing now, but with a couple of  changes.   For example, he wants me to start looking into ways in January for  two reasons.  The first is that his contract year is coming up and the second is that his son is starting to show some  signs of life.  We want to make sure  we give him a chance to show us why HE deserves a second chance.   I will be out of the office on Tuesday,  1/21/02, so  I will have to start all over again.  I will be back after 2 months, but I will have to do so without Chris.   I guess I will be the first to vote in June on  whether Chris should remain on the team or move on.

Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE\n\nYour urgent need to have   these issues resolved ASAP is exactly why I am wanting to  work with you.  Specifically,   this issue is around when Earth Resources acquired an unlimited supply of gas from   Altra and is now seeking an indemnification against   claims from its former employees who believe the acquisition was made without their prior approval.  Simply put,   the leases in question are written so that they are enforceable   (the employees agree to service the leases in a certain manner regardless of whether the lease is written in   agreement or not).  The employee's current location is also important because they may want to relocate to a new location when they are   done with   their contracts (I believe one of the key factors that determine which employees are good   to keep and which are bad is whether or not they are still eligible to receive   severance benefits).  Because the leases are written such that they are enforceable,  the employees may not want to give up their severance benefits (and the lease provides the employees with an incentive to keep them in the lease).    I want to talk with you about whether severance benefits are available for this group and   how they can best   utilize these benefits.  Can you call on Cheryl to get clarification on this point?  If you don't,  can you give me a call (801-989-272686) and I can get clarification on    the severance provisions for this particular situation.

Please assist me in this regard by ASAP finishing the business practice of accounting that is currently required prior to accessing the insurance coverage that is currently standard business practice.  Once this is completed the insurance coverage will be much more readily available.  Please have your office staff contact us prior to the start of trading as we have some very strong,  pending litigation with Enron over the mis-selling of their product to the unsuspecting  general public.  This is a huge deal and our previous existence as a selling platform for Enron-branded  products was not that great.  We renegotiated the LPR terms with them in order to sell more of our own  products when they initially came to us.   The results of this process have been  disastrous.   We are now advertising for trades under our own brand but were originally  negotiating with them to be the trade marketing representative.   This position requires a great deal of  training and extensive reviewing of new policies and processes.   It is a highly demanding  position that demands a very high standard of performance.   I have been working hard at trying to land these positions but am being very hard pressed.  My oldest son turns 16 later this month and has successfully completed his first year of college.   Without admitting any faults in regard to this venture, I would have preferred to  have started this venture over a year ago.   However, as it is currently unfolding, I feel that starting this endeavor over a year ago was the correct approach.

I thought that you might be interested in our rental agreement. Apparently, Ms. Arif and her family moved here from Saudi Arabia about a year ago.  My wife and I (Ms. Arif and I) were originally from Egypt and we moved here about a year ago.  We're originally from California but our area codes are actually pretty minor so we originally thought that we were moving to Southern California.  But Ms. Arif is originally from Saudi Arabia and our area codes are really big so we originally thought that she was going to California.  And she is originally from Utah so our area codes are actually pretty big too.  So, I guess her new area code is a big deal because her new home is located in an area where CA does not have enough power for its population density to support an independent power plant.  We originally planned on starting up the plant back in September but Ms. Arif's visa condition (you heard me right) called for us to wait until January 2, which was absolutely unthinkable because the plant would be operational back then.  Finally, Ms. Arif's visa called for us to put the plant up for auction which was completely out of the question because Ms. Arif is a citizen of a different country and our country doesn't recognize her new nationality.  We finally put the plant up for auction last week so that's why Ms. Arif is in the situation she is in (a crappy one, actually, but that's another story).  Anyway, she is technically our subleasee but she is really our landlord (he bought the unit from us 6 months ago).\n Ms. Arif seems to be living in a one-bedroom apartment on $600 per month (estimate).  We finally sold our last sublet and moved into a one-bed flat on $900 per month (a full month's rent for a one bedroom apartment complex).  We originally thought that maybe we could negotiate a little better sublet if we offered her some equity in exchange for the right to keep her on the lease (which we could have done if we had offered her some cash).  Maybe we could have offered some sort of equity loan (like a down payment schedule that she can't prepay downshift into) or some sort of loan insurance\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Mr. Arif Shaikh\nTitle: Re: Re: Attention/ Ceo/Concerns\n\nMy thoughts are as follows:\n\n1) The lease needs to be in place ASAP for two reasons.  First, the new agreement calls for payment monthly (which doesn't seem fair to me since I'm paying this guy for two months' rent and interest).  My guess is that he'll pay us in mid August (assuming nothing falls through and we're on the hook for the remainder).  Second, I was thinking back to earlier this year when Cece was involved and how Cece was handling things.  My feeling is that Cece isn't quite ready to go to court (or to give up their crappy apartment complex).  There are a few issues with this new lease that I'm not sure you and Cece are aware of.  I was told by Cece that if they gave me a clause about a late payment I would need to include a counterparty statement (i.e., if they pay late what would happen to the balance if they didn't)?\n\n \n\n -----Original Message-----\n\n From: \tShaikh, Amr; Mellencamp, Lisa; Mckay, Sean; Smith, Dustin; Huddleson, Diann; Belden, Dan (Legal); Smith, Justin (Legal); Knight, Barbara N.; Smith, Joseph; Hoatson, Tom (Legal); Smith, Chris; Stokley, Tim (Legal); Knight, John; Copeland, Bill (Legal); Knight, Sherrilyn (Legal); Knight, Grant (Legal); Knight, John; Copeland, Bill S.; Knight, Grant (Legal); Knight, Grant (Legal); Knight, Grant ( Legal ); Knight, Grant ( Legal ); Knight, Grant ( Legal ) \n\nCece's attorney told me that his client waived all rights to legal counsel and waived all objections to the draft of notarized confirmation that is being executed.

It is the antithesis of the classic managing-by-committee approach.   It is the opposite of collaborative thinking and is very difficult to sustain over time.   The key to sustain this approach, as with many aspects of business, is a skill set and a commitment to keep improving each and every day.   You need to show your skills and be committed to continuing to improve them.   This is why it is so important that you show yourself to be an active part of the process and positively contributing member of the solution.  \n  \n I do appreciate the concern for your son and the concerns that other parents may have.  The reality is that as of today, my son is in the most advanced stages of cancer care and treatment and I do not want him to continue living a life of dependency and pain.  I want him to continue living his life in the way that is most comfortable for him and his family.   Since his parents separated, I have spent a great deal of time with my son and I am deeply committed to making sure that he has the best possible start in life.   My goal is to help him realize his full potential and I want him to look to me for direction in the beginning stages of his journey.

Unfortunately, our (probably short) time line on this transaction is very short.  You have been referred to me by an Intereoretty broker-dealer who is very promising and has excellent relationships with a number of international financial institutions.  Our goal is to convince  these folks that we can deliver on our time  line.  Unfortunately, our time line is very long.   In fact, our time  line is much shorter than the one-year deadline.   We have started negotiating with these folks and we intend to move  this process along very quickly.   This process should be completed by the end of the  first week of June.   However, due to the urgency of this transaction, certain co-ordinates and information has been  lost due to the transition.  To return to our original time line, we need your comments and  suggestions on how we can make this process flow in a less  intensive manner.  It is my hope that the more immediate concerns can be mitigated or  eliminated in the interim.   As we have discussed, I would like to keep the original 1/2 mile time line  with an urgent revision to it.   This revision needs to be in place no later than June 2013.   This way, we get our wish granted and we still have  some flexibility in the event that we lose money.   An urgent revision to the settlement we have already made with the ADEA would  be in order before June.     However, due to the urgency of this transaction, I have to propose to  you today and you have until Monday to make your decision.   If you decide to accept the revision to the settlement,  then you will have until early July to approve the revised agreement.      If, on the other hand, you decide to reject the proposed changes, then you will  have until August to do so.    The proposed revisions to the settlement should be in place no sooner  than August 13.     This way, we avoid any \"ifs\" and \"buts\" about the  appropriate timeline.      I hope you and your family are doing well.

I thought that we might want to discuss some contingency plans if things did not work out.   I have the same problem you have.  You said that you would look for a solution to this but I have not found one.   It takes two.  I will call you back.   \n\nYou won't believe it, but I am having an affair with my best friend's son.  It started out as a cold email from you about an unspecified   medical condition.  It was really nothing fancy, but it was something that  didn't feel right.  I just want to be clear that this is totally out of the blue and that  it has never happened to me before.  I was very upset that you took the time to read my email and to talk to me about it.  You were supposed to have the conversation with your son about being a dad.  That conversation never happened.  You feel that I am trying to cheat on you with my girlfriend.  I am not trying to lie, I just don't think that's appropriate.   I wish I could answer your questions for you, but I can't.    I just feel that after this conversation we need to talk about  something other than the relationship.    I can't keep lying to you about what has happened.   I just want to be clear that this has never happened and that  it never crossed my mind to lie and cheat on your behalf.    I'm very upset about how everything turned out and how things have changed since then.    I am not proud of what has happened and I hope you can put away this past weekend.    You have been a huge help and I am so glad that you came to my rescue.

I am sure there are many more personal details I would want to share with you, but I wanted to start this evening with a plea to you to come home and set things up so that  things don't get any more serious than they already are.\n\nI know you are very upset with me for not having initiated contact with Teresa Olvera about meeting with her about this issue.  With Teresa's permission, I was thinking along the lines of \"meet me at her house, put your arms around me, and tell me I am important\".  However, Teresa's permission was needed in order to move forward with this important matter.  I suggest you not discuss this further as it would be unwise and not in the best interests of the case.\n\nIf you do discuss this further with me, I would love to take the conversation to another level and try to help people in the process of moving past their past mistakes.  However, this is not an attack on Teresa.  Teresa made some personal sacrifices in order to help build this great family.  She is an example for every child in the Komen Foundation and for that I am eternally indebted.  Her unwavering commitment to doing what is right is a source of immense pride to me and to her.  Even when faced with terrible choices, she chose to be the one to make them; that was her strength.  An example to look up to and a champion for every child in the area.  So, I am eternally grateful and humbled by this gift.      My God is great and my family is blessed beyond measure.

The SEC has grossly understated the cost \n incurred by PG&E and its subsidiaries in southern California to maintain these contracts and to \n which they are entitled.  It is unacceptable that my office should be considered a hub \n for investigation or prosecution of these errors.

Please respond ASAP to this email if you want to make this     important decision soon. Otherwise, I risk having our children (or our loved ones) ostracized or killed for not     following the rules.     My oldest son is 6 and my 3 year old son is only 1 year old.  They are in daycare because their daycare requires both parents to be present for safety reasons.  My son is being protective of my 6 year old when he gives me this information.   I would love to hear from you about how you feel about this situation.   If you feel that this is not an important decision for you to make, then please don't send this email.  You may not be the ideal parent for your child, but you are the only person who can make it    happen.  And if you are, then you need to tell me so, because I never gave you an ultimatum.   If you want to talk about this, then we need to sit down and decide how we want to   parent these children.   In addition to not wanting to \"burden\" my son with \"everything,\"   I also want to avoid making him feel guilty for not having made this decision when he was asked to.   When he was asked to choose, he said that he would do everything possible to help me decide which schools are the \"right\" for my family.  This is a huge decision for him and it is very confusing at first.  I want to make sure that he understands exactly what I am trying to do when I send this email.   If he doesn't get it   then he needs to talk with me, because I screwed up big time.   I am very sorry that this has happened.   I was totally out of the loop regarding this decision.   If I had gotten this information earlier, I would have gladly taken the child to either of the daycare we have available for him, because he doesn't pick on me for not having decided this.   If I had decided not to have him stay with me because the daycare is only a 20 minute drive away, then I would have gladly provided transportation back to LA with him on the same   terms as we provided for", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: From:Mrs Farah al-Hashemi\nDear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi :\n\n    I thought that it might be helpful if I forwarded a document which describes some of the transaction costs associated with the   transactions I have been ordered to undertake.

However, I think our biggest concern should be with God.  Every time I hear His name, It changes my life.  I cry when I think of His wayward children and how they changed my life.  I am a sinner, But I am a sinner because I did wrong.  I hope you understand My remorse and \n my sorrow for your son.  And for your family.  I, Too, have experienced Firsthand what it is like to lose a parent, sibling, friend, or relative.  I was raised in a 2,000 acre ranch house on a 60 acre plot in the middle of nowhere.  My mom and dad never had a lot of contact with each other, so I didn't really know how to bring people into our home.  Luckily, I have a very close (but not very close) circle of friends and people who care for me.  I also have several long term, Bible Study groups in the area.  I go to church on Sunday mornings for the mornings of both meetings.  I take the morning off, so I can be with my family and try to spend time with my faith group.  I also happen to be a big Sunday morning person, so I usually get in to church as well.  People often ask me why I go to church on Sunday mornings, but I usually just answer that it is because I get to spend time with my family.  I just got back from a trip to Portugal, so I am really enjoying it.  Oh, and have you heard   the latest on the case against our family.  One of our uncles is in the slammer for apostasy, which sounds like a painful and confusing process, but it is a process that Jesus Christ and His people have put in!   We as a family are now living in fear that the day will come that we have to walk out on all fours and pick up our shopping.  We have been dealing with this fear for the last few days.   At home , my oldest son is extremely upset about not being sent to a \"crisis pregnancy test \" and he is not sure if he will pass the \"because he does not know.\" He does not want to \"force\" the issue. He wanted to talk about it with his \"special someone else.\" I was really afraid that it would change his attitude, but it would be \"unfair\"weird\"better for him", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: FOR URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP\nDear X-MOR; FOREIGN TRUST BANK PLC\n \n  \n \n \n   \n Your urgent response is most appreciated.

Your failure to appear and accept this order will damage your case and the case of   Rebecca Abbot.   I will hold you accountable for your   non-compliance with this order.   If you do not appear or agree to   these terms and conditions, then you should not be issuing this subpoena in the first place.   Court is very clear that they do not have jurisdiction over   this matter since this is a federal case.    You can request that your   subpoena be superseded at any time by either party.   This is not a federal proceeding and there is a big difference   between what the federal court is doing and what the states are doing.   The federal court can do   very limited searches and seizures but does not have the power to impose strict   censorship.   The states can.   This is a federal proceeding and the   powers   granted to the feds by the states are very limited.   For example, the feds can't do anything about   a missing 2-year-old in California whose father is an oil   well speculator.   Even if the feds did manage to snoop around a bit,   it would take a lot longer than two years to find out where the 3-year-old was.   So, the states are trying to limit the   scope of the search so that the scope of the investigation narrows as much as possible.   But this still leaves the door open for the feds to do something that the   states couldn't do.   The states can get pretty much what they want but the feds can't.   That's why I'm vouching for   this process.   It takes two to form a cartel -- one that is heavily weighted   toward one side and the other heavily weighted toward the other -- and then the cartel has the   incentive to keep the other side off balance.   The result will be a level playing field that     benefits consumers and small businesses alike.     I'm        just  letting you know so you can start the preliminary negotiations.

Please review this, if it is not in effect please return immediately and we will resubmit  this as agreement at a later date.  This is a case in point, as we discussed extending the deadline to Dec. 1 to March 31 which is very problematic becasue its in effect  until the 1st of December.  This is not a situation where we have ``to do this, they do that, why shouldn't we make the rules retroactive to give them a fighting chance at the  fee schedule they chose,'' etc.  Simply by signing this document, both sides have committed  to doing business in accordance with the non-compete clause of the agreement.  This provision is very clear and  positive in nature and is intended to encourage free  exchange of ideas and information.  The counter parties intention was clearly to  quash any attempt at a settlement that does not include this provision.  This is a huge win for the  parties, and i am sure many others as well.  This is a big win for us as the longer we wait to resolve this the  more it will cost us in lost business and frustration.  I was right there with  you when you first identified this issue.

Your son will absolutely love having someone to play with.  We will be playing in the new Little Mermaid play at the Met Gala on Sunday, so  y'all will get to see our daughter and our grand daughter before the week is out. The Met Gala is usually a great time and our whole family really enjoys it.  Hope you can keep in touch with your family for a couple of days so that  we don't get lost in the summer and forget about each other.  As for today...  Well...  I am going to give my resignation to Jim Rogers.  I told him  earlier that I was stepping down as AD.  He is my boss now and I was going to take his place because he was going to get me an interview for the Assistant Managing Director spot.  I was going to interview him on Friday.  I don't think we will be able to catch the Met Gala on July 1 because of a business trip to Doha.  We will be able to catch it July 25-26, if we are in the right  mood.  Plus, I have a family trip coming up that weekend (July 27-28) that I can't get into.  I just got back from visiting my oldest\u00a0 son in Mexico City, and he was very interesting.  He has a master's  degree in international finance from the Business School of the University of Phoenix.  I know the zone where he is from is very difficult to get into because of  restrictions imposed by the Mexican government.  But he is now doing very well and looking forward to having a job  a family.  I am giving him a one year ultimatum to stay put himself down  or go to work with the stress of it", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Business Transactions/Agreement\nDear Mr. Frank Wantz,\n\nApologises we have changed the business procedures and/or processes so that the above agreement cannot be effective because  it is signed by attorneys acting on behalf of Transco.  Please review this, if it is not in effect please return immediately and we will resubmit  this as agreement at a later date.  This is a case in point, as we discussed extending the deadline to Dec. 1 to March 31 which is very problematic becasue its in effect  until the 1st of December.  This is not a situation where we have ``to do this, they do that, why shouldn't we make the rules retroactive to give them a fighting chance at the  fee schedule they chose,'' etc.  Simply by signing this document, both sides have committed  to doing business in accordance with the non-compete clause of the agreement.  This provision is very clear and  positive in nature and is intended to encourage free  exchange of ideas and information.  The counter parties intention was clearly to  quash any attempt at a settlement that does not include this provision.  This is a huge win for the  parties, and i am sure many others as well.  This is a big win for us as the longer we wait to resolve this the  more it will cost us in lost business and frustration.  I was right there with  you when you first identified this issue.  I can't remember exactly where, but from what i can gather we wanted to  avoid arbitration at all costs.  This is a significant win for consumers,  and i think for everybody involved.

I, too, have been  in and out of the hospital since last week.  My son came home with a \"broken arm\".  I tried to fix him, but it was too late.  I washes up on Thursday, and then my little one  had another setback.  We are  not breaking up over this, but I do want you to know that we need  to come to terms with this.  I know that it is hard to believe, but our marriage is  over.  And yet, this morning, my phone rang and a woman on the other end of the phone said that she was gay, and wanted to get married to me.  I had never thought about it before, but it seems that my life has completely changed.  I was raised in a Christian home, but I am now raising an Apostolic home, and that has completely transformed me.  I no longer feel the need to prove myself, and I have never looked at this life with the negative  energy that I once did.  It causes such a reaction in me that I do not even know how to process this.  I need to talk with this woman about how she can move in together with the kids, and I will be more than happy to contribute to raising the kids, if you want. But I have to be honest and say that I am not exactly sure how to start a conversation with this woman, because I have not done so. I have felt like a failure as a gay man, and as a father of a gay son. I came out to my parents a long time ago, and my parents were very accepting of me. My parents even came to terms with me a year ago, when I was still in the closet, that I was going to start living my life as a gay man.  That's pretty much the story of my life, really.  I am very glad that you were even interested in having dinner with me, because I had a rough winter, and it was really relaxing doing something for your anniversary.  Even though the wedding is months away, I still get choked up thinking about it every time I think about you.  That's pretty much the story of my life, really, except that I have three beautiful kids and an apartment with an apartment manager that is very stressful enough without a doubt that I will eventually have to worry about whether I am able to care for them", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: I will appreciate your reply\nDear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi\n\nI appreciate your note and wish to discuss the issue of family leave now that the child has been returned to us.

I just got back from an Archer meeting with the ADEQ Commissioner and he  informed me that he was going to meet with you later that afternoon.  He was going to  draft a complaint to the ADEQ regarding this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle.   I had hoped that you could use your ```Summon Richard!''` call to  force this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle corrected.  Unfortunately, because of Federal regulations, the  Empowerment Principle is not in effect until Friday, 1/1/01.   I had hoped that you could use your persuasive skills and the  intimidation factor of a lawsuit to  force this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle   righting the  mistake.   Unfortunately, due to a court ruling,  this is no longer an option.   Since Federal regulations do not recognize the  Empowerment Principle, this is not an option.   I will consider other remedies, but  in the mean time we need to get this resolved.   Please understand, this is not a football problem.  It  is much more serious than that.   I don't want you to get discouraged because you are not on the field doing what  you were designed to do.

I tried to give you an update on my  situation.   I have a conference call with this gentleman and his assistant on   Thursday.   I hope you were not  too  surprised to learn that my youngest child is engaged to be married   on September 20.  That would mean that my engagement is over September and the search for our   engagement ring will start September 25.   I was hoping that you could at least give me some update on what is holding  up our engagement ring deal.   Most recently, our engagement ring deal with the big 6 met with a major revamp.   I was not too thrilled with the new take on things, but it  looks like we are still on the right track.   I know that you were  very upset with me for taking the ring on this trip.   You wrote to me that  \"you were going to give the ring to  Mom\" and I responded that \"even if it costs $50,000,  I need it now.\"   Your tone was very  different that day than it would be a couple of weeks  later.   I want to  remind you how serious of a person I am.  I am not going to lie and tell you that I am not upset about the money.   I certainly wouldn't want to do  something stupid like that again.   I love you and you have always done a great job of supporting me.   Would it be appropriate to assume that we will be getting along fine in this relationship?   I cannot believe the out pour of help  that came my way.   My load has been lifted considerably, but I have not really felt the rush of emotions like you did.   I have a lot of unanswered questions that I want you to answer for me, but I also want you to know that we are still very different people.   I would like to get to the bottom of exactly what steps I have to take to get exactly what I want,  and I don't want to do that by beating around the bush for you.   I was hoping that we could work out an amicable way to split the money and get it  remitted to me by the time you get this letter.   As it is right now, I just want to work out an exit strategy to use if we don't make a decision\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Mrs.Rita Diatta.\nTitle: Re: Re: Urgent  Proposal\nDear  Dr. Bursch,\n\nI suggest putting off the wedding until after the stock market recovers.   The stock market is up\u00a0 +100%.  My guess is that your family will still be involved at least in the form of a caretaker\u00a0 for a while.  As things stand, the wedding is a press conference and gathering for your mother  and I.  We need to plan accordingly.  Plan on visiting your family in a couple of weeks to make sure they  are OK.  I have a hard  time believing that this has happened.   I was there last spring with my dad when a similar thing  happened.  I was in hospital for two weeks straight because of an intestinal  blockage.  My mom had to come up from out of town  with me.  Fast forward to this past  spring and my dad was able to get his  son out  of the hospital.  I have been there twice since then and my mom  is doing much better than  she was last year.  Everything is going smoothly for me.  I have two children that are 5 and 3 years old.  My oldest one is 15 months and a half old and his name is  James Madison.  James is now an IB student and is on his first year of middle school.   I took him to my high school in April and he was <3 weeks old.  Unfortunately, his first year  at my high school was tough and his first memory is of the winter  storm that rolled through Houston.   All of the above are negative cnet memories now.  Our little one loves spending time with my  family and plays with James' dog.  He is now looking for his first six months at my high school as James'  dog greets him as `puppy` and treats him like a <3 year old boy.  And, he is <3 years old because of the first summer he spent with my parents  and I in Houston.  Needless to say, his first six months are nothing short of a miracle.   I am so thankful to be alive and to be doing something I love that I'm able to do now.   I will be receiving very warm letters from those that are close to me and I will be  meeting soon with every member of my family regardless of location.   I will be moving back to Houston by the end of the summer  month and will be taking a job as a software ", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: Urgent  Proposal\nDear Mrs.Rita Diatta.\n\nI was out of the office on Monday, November 20.   I tried to give you an update on my  situation.   I have a conference call with this gentleman and his assistant on   Thursday.   I hope you were not  too  surprised to learn that my youngest child is engaged to be married   on September 20.  That would mean that my engagement is over September and the search for our   engagement ring will start September 25.   I was hoping that you could at least give me some update on what is holding  up our engagement ring deal.   Most recently, our engagement ring deal with the big 6 met with a major revamp.   I was not too thrilled with the new take on things, but it  looks like we are still on the right track.   I know that you were  very upset with me for taking the ring on this trip.   You wrote to me that  \"you were going to give the ring to  Mom\" and I responded that \"even if it costs $50,000,  I need it now.\"   Your tone was very  different that day than it would be a couple of weeks  later.   I want to  remind you how serious of a person I am.  I am not going to lie and tell you that I am not upset about the money.   I certainly wouldn't want to do  something stupid like that again.   I love you and you have always done a great job of supporting me.   Would it be appropriate to assume that we will be getting along fine in this relationship?   I cannot believe the out pour of help  that came my way.   My load has been lifted considerably, but I have not really felt the rush of emotions like you did.   I have a lot of unanswered questions that I want you to answer for me, but I also want you to know that we are still very different people.   I would like to get to the bottom of exactly what steps I have to take to get exactly what I want,  and I don't want to do that by beating around the bush for you.   I was hoping that we could work out an amicable way to split the money and get it  remitted to me by the time you get this letter.   As it is right now, I just want to work out an exit strategy to use if we don't make a decision\n\n<ReReEmail>\nFrom: Mrs.Rita Diatta.\nTitle: Re: Re: Urgent  Proposal\n", "index": 186}, {"text": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: INVESTMENT CONSIGNMENT\nDear FREDRICK WILLIAMS & MR.

The  club practice on Thursday evenings from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (subject to change as the  members and parents of the varsity  club indicate).

I would  rather they got to decide than have me weigh in on  it.  But I have to  meet with the district this afternoon to get  the district to back off this issue.  I have been talking to  some of the parents of the varsity  girls and they are strongly opposed to the policy.  They say that this is about choice, not  obligation.  They urge  us to take a hard look at this issue and come up with a better  rationale for why the varsity boys' not playing.

I was going to go back there and put the damage estimate there.  With the new building that just got started, some hot stuff started going on.  At first I thought it was just another \"occupancy\" I have.  Then I realized it was just getting started.  It was not a good time to be evicted.   I got a text from Maria asking me to leave.  I didn't know her whereabouts and I didn't want to hear about it anymore.  When John asked me why I had not been in on the party for the last 30 years, I finally confessed that I had smoked pot with my best friend 40 years ago.  My worst nightmare is that I may have started drinking again, because I can't remember now.  But I do know that I have never been more than moderately intoxicated and that I have never been in a situation in which I was asked to leave before or had my house in order (in fact, I was on my 200th visit today).  So my bad habits are not as bad as I thought they would be, and I have a hard time believing that I have been sober for so long.  It really is a blur.  My best friend was really going to marry his high school sweetheart, and their child was about to be born to their eldest son.  I had just moved into a new house with my wife, our 7 year old daughter and my son in January.  Our new 3 bedroom Colonial in Jupiter is about a mile south of my house on the other side of the barn.  We finally sold our old place and moved into a new one, because our old one had serious issues with our landlord.  My old place was pretty much bare bones, with very little else.  My wife is now working as an account manager for an internet company, and we built our new house on $70,000 worth of house stuff.  We had originally planned to live in a 2 bedroom, but we finally settled on a 3 bedroom, because we were having trouble finding a place to live with our daughter.  We finally found a nice apartment in South Beach about a mile south of my house.  We actually got a job at an accounting firm, so that is where our eldest son is now, and we just finishing his bachelor's program there.  We actually are actually renting an apartment in South Beachwood down the street from our house, because the landlord is", "input_context": "<replyEmail>\nTitle: Re: A CONSIDER IT URGENT BUSINESS INVOLV ERSE\nDear GEORGE LAMING\n\nI trust this message finds you doing well.\n\nWith a huge undertaking like this, it is important that we come to an agreement early in the morning.
